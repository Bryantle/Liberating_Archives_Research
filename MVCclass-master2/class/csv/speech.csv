2923502,2923501,2923503,19196,1,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will come to _x000D_
order._x000D_
    I want to welcome our witness. I understand there may be _x000D_
circumstances where you may need to depart. We are just glad _x000D_
you are here. If you need to leave in 2 minutes, leave. I _x000D_
understand that there may be something occurring that will _x000D_
cause that. So please, just whatever makes you comfortable._x000D_
    I am glad to be here with our outstanding ranking member, _x000D_
who I have enjoyed working with so much. And I am glad we are _x000D_
having this hearing today on something that is so important to _x000D_
people around the world._x000D_
    I do not normally read opening statements. I think I may do _x000D_
it. We have been sort of focused on another issue for a while, _x000D_
but I think people know that since 1954, U.S. international _x000D_
food aid programs have helped to feed over 3 billion people and _x000D_
promote food security in over 150 countries. Most U.S. food aid _x000D_
is provided through Food for Peace, which is currently funded, _x000D_
on average, at $1.6 billion annually. Over the past 5 years, _x000D_
U.S. food aid has helped 56 million people, on average, per _x000D_
year._x000D_
    Today's hearing will provide the committee with an update _x000D_
on the current operations of the program, including the _x000D_
challenges it faces while responding to increasingly dangerous _x000D_
emergencies._x000D_
    This increasingly challenging global environment has _x000D_
illustrated to Congress the need for greater flexibility in how _x000D_
Food for Peace operates. The law requires that 100 percent of _x000D_
the food aid to be delivered be U.S.-purchased commodities, and _x000D_
50 percent of that is to be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels._x000D_
    While recent reforms in the farm bill provide some _x000D_
administrative funds to be used for such things as locally and _x000D_
regionally purchased food aid and/or food vouchers, this _x000D_
limited flexibility must be executed in tandem with U.S.-_x000D_
purchased commodities. The cargo and commodity preferences _x000D_
create inefficiencies that undermine our ability to get maximum _x000D_
impact in addressing poverty and suffering from our U.S. food _x000D_
aid dollars._x000D_
    In some cases, where U.S. national security interests are _x000D_
at stake, like in Syria and other regions in conflict, U.S. _x000D_
food aid plays an important role in U.S. policy and engagement. _x000D_
These interventions would not be possible if we relied on U.S.-_x000D_
purchased commodities._x000D_
    Increasing flexibility in the Food for Peace program would _x000D_
provide up to $444 million in savings, allowing the United _x000D_
States _x000D_
to reach as many as 12 million more starving people, up to 2\1/_x000D_
2\ months faster in some cases._x000D_
    Again, I think this just jumps out at us, that self-imposed _x000D_
limitations--I am tired, I have not had a lot of sleep. I will _x000D_
just say that the special interests that capture this program _x000D_
cause people around the world to starve._x000D_
    While the impact of reforming U.S. food aid overseas is _x000D_
profound, the domestic implications are minor, as food aid only _x000D_
contributes 1.41 percent to net farm income and 0.86 percent to _x000D_
agriculture exports._x000D_
    I have joined forces with my friend and colleague, Senator _x000D_
Coons, by authorizing with him the Food for Peace Reform Act. _x000D_
We are seeking to increase the flexibility of our food aid _x000D_
programs and are looking to our witnesses today to illustrate _x000D_
why reform to the program matters._x000D_
    For many around the globe we are not yet reaching but _x000D_
could, it is a matter of life and death._x000D_
    Again, we thank you for being here. I look forward to _x000D_
turning to Senator Cardin and maybe Senator Coons, who has been _x000D_
such a champion._x000D_
    But I hope that out of this hearing, something is going to _x000D_
occur where we will do the things necessary to make sure that _x000D_
our U.S. dollars help those people that today, as we sit here _x000D_
in this comfort, are starving because of special interests here _x000D_
in our own Nation._x000D_
    With that, Senator Cardin."
2923503,2923502,2923504,19196,1,"    Senator Corker, first of all, thank you for _x000D_
convening this hearing._x000D_
    Yesterday, this committee dealt with a very visible issue _x000D_
of national security, and that is preventing Iran from becoming _x000D_
a nuclear weapon state. Today, we are dealing with another _x000D_
issue of national security, but it is not quite as visible as _x000D_
the possibility of a nuclear Iran._x000D_
    I think we all understand that extremists get their _x000D_
strength from people who are desperate and have little hope. _x000D_
And when you are hungry, you are desperate._x000D_
    So this is an issue, as I see it, of national security. It _x000D_
also, of course, is an issue of what this country stands for, _x000D_
the values of America, what this country has been, a leader _x000D_
worldwide in promoting the right values._x000D_
    So I welcome this hearing. I thank Senator Corker, I thank _x000D_
Senator Coons, for their leadership in bringing forward reform _x000D_
of our food aid and the Food for Peace program so that we can _x000D_
do more with the resources that we have._x000D_
    Senator Corker pointed out the incredible record that this _x000D_
country has had since 1954. Three billion people have benefited _x000D_
from U.S. programs in 150 countries. That is an incredible _x000D_
record._x000D_
    But let me give you one that we are not proud about. Since _x000D_
2009, the Food for Peace program has lost about 37 percent of _x000D_
its funding, in spite of the fact that the international need _x000D_
has grown. Today, 805 million people are estimated to be _x000D_
chronically hungry; and 51.2 million people have been displaced _x000D_
by conflict. So the needs today are greater, and the resources _x000D_
are less._x000D_
    The United States has provided international leadership. _x000D_
Because I represent the Senate at the United Nations, along _x000D_
with Senator Johnson, I have had the opportunity to be up at _x000D_
the United Nations to talk about the millennium development _x000D_
goals and discuss where we have been successful. But to get _x000D_
people out of poverty and hunger is an international effort._x000D_
    These millennium development goals are working. But U.S. _x000D_
leadership is critically important._x000D_
    So we have to do a better job with Food for Peace. And the _x000D_
legislation that the two of you have brought forward is about _x000D_
using our money more efficiently. It has been estimated that we _x000D_
could serve as many as 8 million to 12 million more people with _x000D_
the same amount of resources, if we reform the system--8 _x000D_
million to 12 million. I know numbers. You do not see numbers. _x000D_
You could have all those people here today. I think it would be _x000D_
a very visible reminder that we have to do a better job, and it _x000D_
really could have a major impact on our goals and on our _x000D_
national security._x000D_
    I do want to give a word of caution. There are serious _x000D_
issues that have to be resolved, if we are going to be able to _x000D_
move this legislation forward. We have concerns in the maritime _x000D_
industry. We have concerns with U.S. agriculture. We have _x000D_
concerns by the partnerships with our NGOs, dealing with _x000D_
lockbox and monetization and other issues. These are legitimate _x000D_
concerns, and we are going to have to work through that._x000D_
    But, Mr. Chairman, if we can work through the nuclear _x000D_
review agreement, this should be a piece of cake. We should be _x000D_
able to get this done._x000D_
    So I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. I would _x000D_
ask unanimous consent that I can put statements in the record _x000D_
from Catholic Relief Services, which is headquartered in _x000D_
Baltimore, MD; the U.S. Maritime Industry; and Bread for the _x000D_
World."
2923504,2923503,2923505,19196,1,"    Without objection._x000D_
_x000D_
the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at "
2923505,2923504,2923506,19196,1,"    I am glad that these entities that have so _x000D_
much to do with this program will have a chance. I know we _x000D_
tried to accommodate additional witnesses. But anyway, I am _x000D_
glad you made that statement._x000D_
    I wonder if Senator Coons would like to make an opening _x000D_
comment."
2923506,2923505,2923507,19196,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Corker. I will be brief._x000D_
    I just want to thank Ranking Member Cardin and you, _x000D_
Chairman Corker, for continuing to bring forward a spirit of _x000D_
bipartisanship and a focus on important and difficult issues._x000D_
    Out of yesterday's markup, I continue to be optimistic we _x000D_
can tackle all sorts of big challenges._x000D_
    Food aid reform is one that has eluded any significant _x000D_
progress for a long time. As you have both cited, it has made _x000D_
enormous impacts around the world. It has fed billions of _x000D_
people over decades._x000D_
    But the twin challenges we face are how to make this _x000D_
program more efficient so that it reaches more people, so that _x000D_
it does the best we can with taxpayer dollars. Yet how do we _x000D_
sustain food aid so that we do not, by making changes that _x000D_
pursue efficiency, suddenly wake up and realize we have lost _x000D_
half or two-thirds of the funding, and in reaching to feed 8 _x000D_
million to 12 million more, ultimately end up feeding fewer? _x000D_
That is the political Rubik's Cube that we need to work _x000D_
together to solve._x000D_
    There is no doubt. There have been studies from GAO to _x000D_
George Mason to nonprofit groups. There is no doubt the current _x000D_
system is inefficient, and it wastes a significant amount both _x000D_
of the commodity and costs. But the core question is, Can we _x000D_
make it both more efficient and more sustainable? I really look _x000D_
forward to working with both of you to achieve that goal._x000D_
    Thank you for this hearing today."
2923507,2923506,2923508,19196,1,"    Thank you. And I think people should know, _x000D_
for the record, one of the reasons that we are having this _x000D_
hearing today is a commitment that was made to Senator Coons, _x000D_
as we closed out last year, that we would deal with this issue. _x000D_
So I thank him for his leadership._x000D_
    Our first witness is director Dina Esposito, as long as she _x000D_
is here, from the USAID Office of Food for Peace. Director _x000D_
Esposito manages the Food for Peace program, which responds to _x000D_
acute food insecurity by providing in-kind food aid locally and _x000D_
regionally procured food aid, food vouchers, and cash transfers _x000D_
to millions of people affected by conflict and natural _x000D_
disasters annually._x000D_
    In addition, it also supports interventions in critical _x000D_
areas such as nutrition, health, agriculture, and livelihood to _x000D_
address the underlying causes of poverty and hunger among the _x000D_
poorest of the poor with development food aid._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and sharing your thoughts. Please _x000D_
take however long you wish to share those thoughts. Then we _x000D_
will have questions. Thank you very much."
2923508,2923507,2923509,19196,2,"    Thank you. Thank you very much for what you _x000D_
and your staff do on behalf of our country. It is deeply _x000D_
appreciated._x000D_
    Just to begin, what would be the implications for U.S. _x000D_
national security if you did not have the flexibility that you _x000D_
now have in Syria and in the region in delivering aid, and you _x000D_
had to rely solely on U.S. commodities?"
2923509,2923508,2923510,19196,2,"    So, critics of us not purchasing food created _x000D_
in the United States say that it increases the chance of using _x000D_
unsafe food._x000D_
    In the places where we have been able to use local and _x000D_
regional food, has this been a problem?"
2923510,2923509,2923511,19196,2,"    So if I hear you correctly, that allegation _x000D_
is a hoax."
2923511,2923510,2923512,19196,2,"    Okay._x000D_
    Critics of reform also claim that cash-based programs _x000D_
transfer cash from the United States to corrupt governments, _x000D_
but we know that the aid is being provided directly to _x000D_
beneficiaries. So can you discuss this issue for us?"
2923512,2923511,2923513,19196,2,"    So generally speaking, that criticism is a _x000D_
hoax. [Laughter.]"
2923513,2923512,2923514,19196,2,"    I am sure there are examples, minor examples. _x000D_
But generally speaking, that is not the case."
2923514,2923513,2923515,19196,2,"    So we are the only major developed country in _x000D_
the world that still provides the bulk of our food aid through _x000D_
domestic commodities."
2923515,2923514,2923516,19196,2,"    I think that kind of speaks for itself._x000D_
    I just would like to know, does this make it more difficult _x000D_
for us to coordinate with other multilateral agencies and other _x000D_
donors in really hard-hit areas like Haiti, for example, in _x000D_
dealing with making sure that people have food when they need _x000D_
it?"
2923516,2923515,2923517,19196,2,"    So the other developed countries like us that _x000D_
care deeply about making sure that people have food, they have _x000D_
more flexibility. We are sort of locked in."
2923517,2923516,2923518,19196,2,"    So as the perceived most innovative free _x000D_
nation in the world, we are really behind the rest of the world _x000D_
when it comes to feeding the poor. Is that correct?"
2923518,2923517,2923519,19196,2,"    Listen, thank you for being here, and I look _x000D_
forward to the questions from our distinguished ranking member."
2923519,2923518,2923520,19196,2,"    First of all, I join the chairman in _x000D_
thanking you for your incredible service to this country and to _x000D_
our global goals. It is a challenge because the world is never _x000D_
staying still and the challenges in the countries you are _x000D_
working in become very difficult at times, and you are still _x000D_
able to move forward. So we thank you very much for that._x000D_
    Food aid cargo helps sustain U.S. commercially flagged _x000D_
fleets. There are concerns that if we change cargo preference, _x000D_
we may not be able to sustain the national defense sealift _x000D_
capabilities our military needs without significant additional _x000D_
Federal expenditures._x000D_
    So how do you intend to balance the efficiency issues that _x000D_
you are trying to get in the food program with ensuring that we _x000D_
have adequate sealift capacity?_x000D_
    Did I stump you?"
2923520,2923519,2923521,19196,2,"    Yes. Using U.S.-flagged vessels not only _x000D_
helps U.S. industry, but also helps the Department of Defense _x000D_
to have sealift capacity in the case of a national need. If you _x000D_
reduce the amount of food being shipped by U.S.-flagged _x000D_
vessels, it requires additional commitments by the Department _x000D_
of Defense to make sure that we have sealift capacity available _x000D_
in the case of emergency._x000D_
    So how do you balance to make sure that the U.S. food _x000D_
program is contributing to our ability to be ready in the event _x000D_
of need by merchant marines?"
2923521,2923520,2923522,19196,2,"    That is not consistent with the information _x000D_
I have received, so I would appreciate if you could clarify _x000D_
that in specifics. I would be very interested to get a _x000D_
commitment from the Department of Defense that they would not _x000D_
be seeking additional resources to meet those needs._x000D_
    If that is the case, I think we should have that on the _x000D_
record--that they can maintain their sealift capacity--because _x000D_
that is not consistent with other information that we have _x000D_
received."
2923522,2923521,2923523,19196,2,"    Let me go to my second point and that is _x000D_
that it is critically important that we are working with the _x000D_
international community. We cannot do this alone. But the U.S. _x000D_
Government cannot do it without our NGO partners. They provide _x000D_
a great deal of the help here. Yet, our NGO partners have _x000D_
concern about the legislation that is pending._x000D_
    If we, on one hand, increase the government efficiencies _x000D_
but lose our private partners, the end result is less _x000D_
availability of food aid globally through the U.S. players._x000D_
    So again, we still have concerns from the NGO community. _x000D_
How do you intend to resolve those issues?"
2923523,2923522,2923524,19196,2,"    There is no question there is reform here _x000D_
that they support. But, bottom line, there is still opposition _x000D_
because they believe it takes away their ability to fund their _x000D_
programs, that they need the flexibility. I think we have to _x000D_
work with the NGO community to resolve those issues._x000D_
    I want to get to one other question, which is pretty _x000D_
fundamental. When I first came to the U.S. Congress in 1987, we _x000D_
could not pass a foreign aid bill. There are many reasons we _x000D_
could not do it, but there was a lack of support among the _x000D_
American people in understanding the role that we play in _x000D_
international development assistance as part of our national _x000D_
security budget. That was part of it._x000D_
    But we did not advertise well that the fact that most of _x000D_
the foreign aid is American-produced products. And when that _x000D_
got better understood, we got more support. And we have strong _x000D_
support for this program because U.S. agriculture says, look, _x000D_
we are selling our products. We are selling them to the _x000D_
government. The government is then using it for international _x000D_
development assistance. So it is a win-win situation. And it _x000D_
acts, in many respects, as a countercyclical problem for _x000D_
American farmers. Now we are saying we are going to cut that _x000D_
back._x000D_
    How do you intend to be able to maintain the strong support _x000D_
that we have in this country from the agricultural community _x000D_
when fewer American farm products are going to be used for _x000D_
development assistance?"
2923524,2923523,2923525,19196,2,    Thank you.
2923525,2923524,2923526,19196,2,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Gardner."
2923526,2923525,2923527,19196,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you to the director for being here this morning._x000D_
    I am a little nervous. I see that Senator Coons has stepped _x000D_
out. I have been following him at every single meeting today so _x000D_
far. I do not know what I am missing, so I hope you will let me _x000D_
know, if his staff is here, if there something I should be at._x000D_
    But I do want to thank the director for the opportunity to _x000D_
be here. I have a couple questions for you. I came in halfway _x000D_
through your testimony, so I want to maybe ask some things that _x000D_
you covered in that._x000D_
    In your testimony, you state that while we are getting less _x000D_
for our dollar with the United States in-kind food assistance _x000D_
and the need for food assistance, it talks about we are getting _x000D_
less for our dollar with U.S. in-kind food assistance._x000D_
    What do you mean by that statement? Are you talking about _x000D_
price? You are talking about commodity prices?"
2923527,2923526,2923528,19196,2,    The first number was?
2923528,2923527,2923529,19196,2,"    $400, now it is $1,200."
2923529,2923528,2923530,19196,2,"    And what is a ton of food. You are not _x000D_
just referring to peas, lentils, beans? What you are referring _x000D_
to when you say a ton of food?"
2923530,2923529,2923531,19196,2,    But usually no produce kinds of things?
2923531,2923530,2923532,19196,2,    Apples.
2923532,2923531,2923533,19196,2,"    And that is because of the shipping and _x000D_
the long shipping times."
2923533,2923532,2923534,19196,2,"    Now will that change a little bit because _x000D_
you have some prices down? I think winter wheat is $4.97 a _x000D_
bushel in Byers, CO, today. Corn is down to its probably pre-_x000D_
2007 levels in some places. That changes up and down. It ebbs _x000D_
and flows."
2923534,2923533,2923535,19196,2,"    The study that you cite in your testimony _x000D_
by Dr. Barrett at Cornell talks about buying food in Africa and _x000D_
Asia. It was 34 percent and 20 percent less expensive, _x000D_
respectively._x000D_
    Did that study take into account perhaps farm programs _x000D_
within those countries that may or may not provide certain _x000D_
subsidies to their farmers that they do not here, just out of _x000D_
curiosity?"
2923535,2923534,2923536,19196,2,"    Okay, so you are not talking about buying _x000D_
it for us to use there. We are talking about helping them build _x000D_
a sustainable base of agriculture. That is what you are talking _x000D_
about."
2923536,2923535,2923537,19196,2,"    Okay. I wanted to make sure that is what _x000D_
it was talking about and not simply saying that we are buying _x000D_
it to subsidize._x000D_
    Let us say lentils, what percentage of U.S. production does _x000D_
U.S. food aid represent for the in-kind side of Food for Peace?"
2923537,2923536,2923538,19196,2,"    But it is not 50 percent. We are talking _x000D_
about a very small fraction of U.S. production. I would think _x000D_
that an economist would not argue that you are driving and _x000D_
setting the market price. I would not think that that is the _x000D_
case._x000D_
    So giving you the flexibility that you need to provide more _x000D_
specific or a better form of aid, if that means displacing some _x000D_
kind of in-kind production, it would be better for you and _x000D_
better for our partners, correct?"
2923538,2923537,2923539,19196,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    And then I may have missed this in your testimony, is there _x000D_
a balance and does it change year by year between in-kind _x000D_
contributions of U.S. aid and cash assistance? How do you _x000D_
prepare for that? I mean, does it depend country by country, _x000D_
situation by situation?"
2923539,2923538,2923540,19196,2,"    It does mean flexibility. Yes, very good. _x000D_
Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923540,2923539,2923541,19196,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I know you were not feeling particularly well when you came _x000D_
in. I hope the response you got today makes you feel a little _x000D_
bit better. We, certainly, thank you for being here._x000D_
    I do want to make a comment, which may generate the need _x000D_
for a response from others, but it is not USAID's job to ensure _x000D_
that our military policy and sealift capacity is met, is it?"
2923541,2923540,2923542,19196,2,"    That is sort of a DOD problem, is it not?"
2923542,2923541,2923543,19196,2,"    I would just say, look, I realize we have _x000D_
some sensibilities that will have to be dealt with. I would _x000D_
hope that the reason Americans, whether they are in the _x000D_
agriculture business or the maritime business or whatever, or _x000D_
the NGO business, especially the NGO business, would support us _x000D_
making changes because other people will not starve._x000D_
    I would hope that people would support this because it is _x000D_
an important American value. And I hope that as we move through _x000D_
this, in spite of the fact that, let us face it, people make a _x000D_
living off U.S. programs, in some cases to the adversity of _x000D_
people who are starving, I would hope we would figure out a way _x000D_
to first prioritize the great work that you are doing and this _x000D_
American value that exists for this program. So thank you._x000D_
    I think there may be a response."
2923543,2923542,2923544,19196,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You got my _x000D_
attention, you did._x000D_
    I strongly support our food program and our development _x000D_
assistance programs. I always have. And I would like to see a _x000D_
larger share of the budget and have said that publicly and will _x000D_
continue to support that._x000D_
    I also want to make sure that every dollar we spend is used _x000D_
in the most efficient way. So I agree with the chairman on that _x000D_
point. We cannot justify inefficiencies in any of our programs. _x000D_
So I agree with you._x000D_
    But I regret that many Americans do not share our view of _x000D_
the importance of development assistance and instead say that _x000D_
we have not taken care of problems at home. You have to do that _x000D_
first._x000D_
    We do both, and we could do a better job at both. But our _x000D_
success in these programs depends upon broad support. And the _x000D_
issues that are being raised with the U.S.-flagged vessels, _x000D_
with the NGO community's partnerships, and dealing with the _x000D_
agricultural community, are sensitive issues that I know the _x000D_
chairman understands and ones I think we need to be sensitive _x000D_
to as we try to pass a reform bill._x000D_
    That was my only reason for raising it, but I want to have _x000D_
more efficiencies in the programs. We have broad support for _x000D_
the reforms that are in your proposal by all sectors of the _x000D_
stakeholders._x000D_
    And what I said originally, I think this is an area where _x000D_
we should be able to try to get together on."
2923544,2923543,2923545,19196,2,"    And, as you mentioned, coming in, I am sure, _x000D_
that based on what has happened over the last week, we, _x000D_
certainly, should be able to deal with this._x000D_
    I would say that one of the things that would hit a chord, _x000D_
I think with every American, is using even the same dollars _x000D_
that we are spending--the same dollars that we are spending--to _x000D_
reach millions more to make sure they are not starving. And _x000D_
with the passage of this legislation, we, certainly, could make _x000D_
that happen."
2923545,2923544,2923546,19196,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it goes _x000D_
back to some of the questions I was asking._x000D_
    In the House of Representatives, I represented a district _x000D_
that was the 11th most-agricultural district out of 435 _x000D_
districts. Colorado has some of the highest wheat- and corn-_x000D_
producing counties in the Nation. Growing up in an implement _x000D_
dealership, I never remember farmers coming in and saying, _x000D_
well, you know, USAID is doing this or that to the program, _x000D_
therefore, I think market prices are going to be dropping _x000D_
today, or we are really going to do well because of it. The _x000D_
talk was what we can continue to do to help our partners._x000D_
    So I think flexibility is key, knowing that it is not about _x000D_
what price is, it is not about the affected market is going to _x000D_
do that day because of a program, because you are talking about _x000D_
1 percent or less of a commodity, and maybe more in some cases, _x000D_
but you are not talking about a market-setting kind of rate. So _x000D_
that should not be a part of the conversation._x000D_
    What ought to be a part of the conversation is giving the _x000D_
tools, the flexibility, and the resources we need to best _x000D_
provide our neighbors around the world with the aid they need _x000D_
so they can grow up with more opportunity instead of less."
2923546,2923545,2923547,19196,2,"    Very good. Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you. Goodbye. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    Okay, we will now turn to our witnesses on the second _x000D_
panel. Our first witness is Mr. David Ray, vice president for _x000D_
policy and advocacy at CARE USA. Mr. Ray has over 20 years of _x000D_
experience working at CARE USA. Founded in 1945, it is one of _x000D_
the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organizations focused _x000D_
on fighting global poverty._x000D_
    CARE USA is an important implementing partner of the Food _x000D_
for Peace program and was an early adopter of some of the food _x000D_
aid programs we are discussing today._x000D_
    I thank you for allowing my daughter to intern with you in _x000D_
Tanzania years ago. It had a huge impact on her life. I thank _x000D_
you._x000D_
    Our second witness is Dr. Vincent Smith, professor of _x000D_
economics at the Montana State University and visiting scholar _x000D_
at the American Enterprise Institute. Dr. Smith's research _x000D_
includes an examination of agricultural science policy, _x000D_
domestic and world commodity markets, risk management, and _x000D_
agricultural trade policy. He has authored nine books and _x000D_
monographs, and published over 100 articles on agriculture and _x000D_
other policy and economic issues._x000D_
    Our third witness is Dr. Stephanie Mercier, a senior policy _x000D_
adviser at the Farm Journal Foundation. Prior to that, Dr. _x000D_
Mercier--am I pronouncing it correctly?--was a chief economist _x000D_
at the Senate Agriculture Committee from 1997 to 2011. Thank _x000D_
you for your service here. She was involved in several reform _x000D_
efforts made to the Food for Peace program._x000D_
    With that, I will recognize Dr. Ray._x000D_
    Thank you all for being here. We look forward to your _x000D_
testimony and your assistance in helping us navigate these _x000D_
issues. Thank you."
2923547,2923546,2923548,19196,3,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Dr. Smith."
2923548,2923547,2923549,19196,4,"    Thank you, Doctor._x000D_
    Dr. Mercier."
2923549,2923548,2923550,19196,5,"    Thank you all for your testimony. I think you _x000D_
have all been most helpful. There are not many Americans, I _x000D_
realize, who watch these kinds of panels, but this panel is _x000D_
selected jointly by Republicans and Democrats, and it is _x000D_
amazing to me that the message is exactly the same by the _x000D_
panelists._x000D_
    I want to ask a few questions and then make a statement, _x000D_
and then turn to our ranking member._x000D_
    Dr. Smith, it is my understanding, if I heard you _x000D_
correctly, that 70 percent to 75 percent of the ships moving _x000D_
food aid are not militarily useful. Is that correct?"
2923550,2923549,2923551,19196,5,"    It is my understanding that that number _x000D_
actually could be as much as 40 percent foreign-owned. Is that _x000D_
correct?"
2923551,2923550,2923552,19196,5,"    Yes. So to go down the same path we did with _x000D_
our former witness, first of all, food aid certainly is not _x000D_
designed for national security. But the fact that this actually _x000D_
has significant effect on our national security again is a _x000D_
total hoax. Is that correct? Let me say, mostly a hoax, okay? "
2923552,2923551,2923553,19196,6,"    I have not seen House of Cards, but I _x000D_
understand they say those kinds of things."
2923553,2923552,2923554,19196,6,"    Well, based on the amount of money we are _x000D_
blowing, I think you said we are spending more on shipping than _x000D_
on food."
2923554,2923553,2923555,19196,6,"    These 450 folks could be sent to Tahiti and _x000D_
supported for the rest of their lives better than any of us, _x000D_
and we would still be saving huge amounts of money. So I think _x000D_
we can figure out a way to deal with that."
2923555,2923554,2923556,19196,6,"    Very good._x000D_
    This is for everybody. In recent years, some countries in _x000D_
Africa have received U.S. food aid in the form of U.S. _x000D_
commodities for several years in a row. Do you think this has _x000D_
hampered some recipients' ability to recover from the shock of _x000D_
the initial disaster that they faced? This is for all of you, _x000D_
briefly."
2923556,2923555,2923557,19196,6,"    Listen, again, I want to thank Senator _x000D_
Cardin, Senator Coons, Senator Kaine, Senator Gardner, who was _x000D_
here earlier. I think that we have an opportunity here to work _x000D_
together to solve this problem._x000D_
    I will say that I wish every American could have seen this _x000D_
testimony today. What is happening in food aid in our Nation, _x000D_
for a few special interests that benefit only marginally, is a _x000D_
national disgrace--a national disgrace. I am going to do _x000D_
everything in my power to make sure that every American I come _x000D_
in contact with is aware that a few special interests that have _x000D_
negligible impact, really, on them, but they have this Nation _x000D_
in their grip, people are dying and starving--dying and _x000D_
starving--because of this national disgrace of corporate _x000D_
welfare that is totally unnecessary, totally unnecessary to the _x000D_
beneficiaries._x000D_
    So I thank you for being here. I look forward to working _x000D_
constructively with people on this committee, as we have so _x000D_
much recently, to ensure that our focus here is on making sure _x000D_
that people who are hungry have the basic food elements that _x000D_
they need to survive._x000D_
    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Ranking Member Cardin."
2923557,2923556,2923558,19196,6,"    Evidently, your comments brought in _x000D_
reinforcements. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    As I said earlier, I strongly support a more robust Federal _x000D_
budget for development assistance, including food aid. I am _x000D_
very disappointed that we not only have not had an increase, _x000D_
but we have had a decrease. We should be increasing the size of _x000D_
the pie going to these national security issues and furthering _x000D_
the policies of America. And I want to make sure that every _x000D_
dollar we spend is spent in the most cost-effective, efficient _x000D_
way. So I join the chairman, Senator Coons, and others in that _x000D_
regard._x000D_
    I do feel, though, obligated to respond on the U.S.-flagged _x000D_
issue. I will be the first to acknowledge that I am not an _x000D_
expert on this. I do not serve on the committees that deal with _x000D_
this issue._x000D_
    But let me just quote from the person who is responsible _x000D_
for that, General Paul Selva, who is the current commander in _x000D_
the U.S. Transportation Command who spoke directly about this _x000D_
issue before the Senate Committee on Armed Services on March 19 _x000D_
of this year. He was commenting about the reductions of cargo _x000D_
being used on U.S.-flagged vessels and specifically referenced _x000D_
the reductions in food aid._x000D_
    He said, ``With the recent vessel reductions, the mariner _x000D_
base is at a point where future reductions in U.S.-flagged _x000D_
capacity puts our ability to fully activate, deploy, and _x000D_
sustain forces at increased risk.'' Now, that is the person who _x000D_
is responsible for our defense needs as to what is happening _x000D_
with U.S.-flagged vessels._x000D_
    Now let me quote from Maj. Gen. Kathleen Gainey commenting _x000D_
about our merchant marines as the fourth arm of the Department _x000D_
of Defense and critical to the Nation._x000D_
    So this is a defense issue. I agree with the chairman that _x000D_
food aid's purpose is not national defense from the point of _x000D_
view of the merchant marines. I agree with you on that. But I _x000D_
do think we need to know the impact it has on U.S. readiness._x000D_
    The last point I would mention, quoting from the U.S. _x000D_
Maritime Industry, that the alternative here is to use foreign-_x000D_
flagged vessels for national defense, or for DOD to build, _x000D_
maintain, and operate the requisite vessels itself._x000D_
    I just think that is an issue that we have to be mindful _x000D_
of. I want to make sure our programs are efficient. It is not _x000D_
this committee's specific charge to deal with this issue, but I _x000D_
do think it is a matter that we have to be mindful of as we go _x000D_
through these types of issues._x000D_
    Let me turn my questioning, though, to an issue that we _x000D_
have more harmony on. I have already mentioned that there is a _x000D_
concern when you reduce the amount of local produced products, _x000D_
as far as popular support is concerned. I think that is a fact. _x000D_
It is something we have to deal with._x000D_
    I do believe, though, there is tremendous benefit by local _x000D_
sourcing of agriculture in the host country. I think it gives _x000D_
us an opportunity to develop the type of economy that will be _x000D_
able to sustain itself and grow and provide for its own people. _x000D_
So there are a lot of advantages to local sourcing._x000D_
    I also think it allows us the opportunity to deal with _x000D_
other goals of development assistance, and that is creating the _x000D_
structures within countries to make sure that they deal with _x000D_
corruption and deal with gender equity. In agriculture, that is _x000D_
a very important factor._x000D_
    But when we source locally, we have the opportunity to have _x000D_
a more direct impact and can really make the lasting changes _x000D_
that can bring about stable countries that can take care of _x000D_
their own needs. So I think that is a real important plus for _x000D_
local sourcing._x000D_
    I talked to former administrator Shah about this on several _x000D_
different occasions, as to how we can improve local capacity _x000D_
and build the types of structures that will be in our long-term _x000D_
interest._x000D_
    So I just would welcome the thoughts of any of the _x000D_
panelists as to how we could be more effective in local _x000D_
sourcing to develop the type of sustainable institutions within _x000D_
the host countries that will give real hope for future _x000D_
stability and economic opportunities in these countries."
2923558,2923557,2923559,19196,6,"    That is very beneficial. The gender issue _x000D_
is critical in these countries. Agriculture is an area where _x000D_
there has been huge discrimination against women."
2923559,2923558,2923560,19196,6,"    So it seems to me that if we leverage local _x000D_
sourcing, we can do that with a focus to really make a lasting _x000D_
change, not just feeding hungry people but giving them a future _x000D_
of hope and a much more stable country."
2923560,2923559,2923561,19196,6,"    Mr. Chairman, I was very pleased to hear _x000D_
from the previous witness about steps they are taking to deal _x000D_
with corruption, because I am very worried about corruption and _x000D_
the efficiency of our programs._x000D_
    It does seem to me that the reforms that you are working on _x000D_
really will give us a better opportunity to deal with these _x000D_
problems in-country, not just providing food but providing a _x000D_
way in which they can have a sustainable future. I think the _x000D_
way the program is being administered from the anticorruption _x000D_
angle is a huge step forward."
2923561,2923560,2923562,19196,6,"    Thank you. Thank you so much for your input _x000D_
and just tremendous successes we have had recently._x000D_
    Senator Perdue."
2923562,2923561,2923563,19196,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Thank you, folks, for being here this morning._x000D_
    Having lived outside the United States, I have witnessed _x000D_
the benefits of what you guys do and I want to applaud what you _x000D_
do, and especially the operation CARE being based in Georgia._x000D_
    I am very proud, Mr. Ray, that you are here._x000D_
    Dr. Mercier, I have just a couple questions. From the _x000D_
business sector and business perspective, your recommendations _x000D_
about increasing efficiency, what reforms and what benefits _x000D_
could those reforms bring to the U.S. agriculture business? And _x000D_
how can that help provide for the needs that we are trying to _x000D_
meet in the programs that you guys are representing? Talk about _x000D_
our port systems and national security, as well as shipping._x000D_
    As part of that, my observation is that one of the problems _x000D_
we have in these host countries that we are trying to ship to _x000D_
is infrastructure._x000D_
    Our State exports to a lot of poultry. One of the problems _x000D_
you have is you can get it to their ports. Once it gets to the _x000D_
port, it is very difficult to distribute within the countries. _x000D_
So protein, fat, sugar, those things are in high demand there._x000D_
    Can you just speak to some of those issues as we look at _x000D_
this?"
2923563,2923562,2923564,19196,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923564,2923563,2923565,19196,6,    Senator Coons.
2923565,2923564,2923566,19196,6,"    Thank you, Chairman Corker, for convening _x000D_
this and leading this effort._x000D_
    Thank you, Senator Cardin, for your insight and your _x000D_
questions._x000D_
    I want to pursue three lines of inquiry, if I might._x000D_
    First, on monetization. David, I want to commend CARE and _x000D_
you for giving up what is tens of millions of dollars of _x000D_
potential cash for CARE in recognition, if I understood your _x000D_
testimony correctly, that there are harmful effects to _x000D_
monetization, that is not just inefficient, it also, in some _x000D_
instances, has been documented to have a negative impact on _x000D_
resiliency and on the development of markets in some of the _x000D_
countries we are most trying to help._x000D_
    Why does monetization continue as a practice? What would be _x000D_
the potential benefits and how might we structure a reduction _x000D_
to monetization and offset it with a more efficient and _x000D_
responsible practice for supporting NGOs, whose primary purpose _x000D_
is providing relief to those who are struggling with food _x000D_
insecurity?"
2923566,2923565,2923567,19196,6,"    This is leading up to my question about _x000D_
reforms we could make by law."
2923567,2923566,2923568,19196,6,"    Senator Coons, if I could, could I add a _x000D_
minute or 2 to your time, and for people who are just watching _x000D_
this, ask your witness to explain how monetization works?"
2923568,2923567,2923569,19196,6,    Sure.
2923569,2923568,2923570,19196,6,"    I think it would be helpful to everyone and _x000D_
help build a case for what you are trying to----"
2923570,2923569,2923571,19196,6,"    If you would, please, because once you _x000D_
really grasp what monetization is and how it works, it is hard _x000D_
to see it as an admirable practice._x000D_
    I am not meaning to impugn those NGOs who benefit from _x000D_
monetization."
2923571,2923570,2923572,19196,6,"    They provide valued and needed services. But _x000D_
the inefficiency of it really is striking._x000D_
    So, Mr. Ray, if you could?"
2923572,2923571,2923573,19196,6,"    And in the same spirit, Dr. Smith, you _x000D_
testified somewhat about the sealift, the maritime fleet that _x000D_
is sustained through cargo preference. Senator Cardin shared _x000D_
some important testimony in front of the Armed Services _x000D_
Committee that suggested that sealift remains an important _x000D_
priority for our national security._x000D_
    You testified earlier that there is a significant mismatch, _x000D_
that a lot of the fleet that is being used for food aid really _x000D_
is not helpful or relevant for maritime military sealift. If we _x000D_
were to simply more directly fund through DOD the maintenance _x000D_
of a DOD appropriate sealift capacity, what difference might _x000D_
there be in efficiency of outcome?"
2923573,2923572,2923574,19196,6,    A rough impression.
2923574,2923573,2923575,19196,6,    Right.
2923575,2923574,2923576,19196,6,"    Understood. So that brings me to my last _x000D_
question, which I think is really the key question here, Dr. _x000D_
Mercier. And the whole panel might address this._x000D_
    So we are using food aid partly to provide food aid, and _x000D_
partly to provide relief from food insecurity, and partly to _x000D_
sustain sealift capacity, and partly to sustain maritime labor, _x000D_
and partly to provide monetization support for NGOs._x000D_
    The concern that has always been raised in these _x000D_
conversations is, what would the impact be if we significantly _x000D_
streamlined and modernized this program so that DOD is paying _x000D_
for sealift and we are providing direct support for NGOs that _x000D_
are doing important development work? And where it is _x000D_
appropriate, we are buying U.S. commodities and shipping them _x000D_
on Jones Act ships and delivering them with American labor. And _x000D_
where it is not, we are doing direct, flexible, local _x000D_
procurement or direct provision through electronic means, as _x000D_
you testified._x000D_
    How would we sustain food aid? How vital are these sectors _x000D_
to sustaining the allocation of food aid?_x000D_
    Senator Cardin raised this central point. The _x000D_
appropriations for food aid have gone down in recent years. I _x000D_
would love to hear from all three of you, what is your _x000D_
guesstimate of the impact on food aid for the long-term, if we _x000D_
were, in fact, to make it more efficient?"
2923576,2923575,2923577,19196,6,"    I am out of time. My question is not about _x000D_
cost-effectiveness. I think we have discussed in great detail _x000D_
how cost inefficient this is._x000D_
    My question is about whether or not the NGO community and _x000D_
the good intentions of the American people are enough to _x000D_
sustain food aid at its current levels or higher, or whether _x000D_
these other communities of interest have to be engaged in order _x000D_
to sustain food aid?_x000D_
    Any opinions from Mr. Ray or Dr. Smith would be welcome as _x000D_
well."
2923577,2923576,2923578,19196,6,"    Mr. Chairman, do you want to let Mr. Ray _x000D_
answer the question?"
2923578,2923577,2923579,19196,6,    Sure.
2923579,2923578,2923580,19196,6,"    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ray._x000D_
    Thank you to the whole panel for your testimony._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923580,2923579,2923581,19196,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Coons, thank you for asking the great question _x000D_
about what if food aid were focused on food aid. That would be _x000D_
a good thing._x000D_
    I would just say, editorially, I doubt there are other aid _x000D_
programs that we participate in that have such a small amount _x000D_
of corporate welfare interests that cause us to waste as much _x000D_
money. I just cannot believe 450 sailors are generating the _x000D_
support for this aid program. And I just hope that we will _x000D_
figure out a way to deal appropriately with it._x000D_
    Senator Shaheen."
2923581,2923580,2923582,19196,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to _x000D_
you and Senator Coons for this legislation, and to all of the _x000D_
panelists for not only your testimony this morning, but for _x000D_
your great work in helping to provide food aid to people around _x000D_
the world._x000D_
    You know, I share the sentiments that have already been _x000D_
expressed, that it is very important for us to look at the _x000D_
budget for food aid and try to increase that, but that we also _x000D_
need to be as efficient as possible, and that there are a lot _x000D_
of things about the current program that do not seem to work in _x000D_
a way that is understandable for the American people._x000D_
    I share your point, Mr. Ray. I think people want what _x000D_
government does to be effective and efficient. And if we can _x000D_
make that case, it is much easier to get support for the _x000D_
programs the government provides._x000D_
    I had a couple specific questions that have come up as a _x000D_
result of Senator Cardin's question and raising the concerns _x000D_
about the maritime industry. Does anybody know--and maybe you _x000D_
know this, Senator Cardin--what percentage of cargo that is _x000D_
shipped by the U.S. maritime industry is actually food aid?_x000D_
    Dr. Mercier."
2923582,2923581,2923583,19196,6,"    Is there a dollar amount that accounts for _x000D_
that, or a percentage of income of the U.S. maritime industry _x000D_
that can be attributed to food aid?_x000D_
    Dr. Smith."
2923583,2923582,2923584,19196,6,"    Senator, would you yield just for 1 minute _x000D_
so I can get Dr. Mercier to just comment?"
2923584,2923583,2923585,19196,6,    Sure.
2923585,2923584,2923586,19196,6,"    As we are winding down our military _x000D_
operations, would the percentage of food aid increase since we _x000D_
are now transporting less military?"
2923586,2923585,2923587,19196,6,"    We do not want to go into that here right _x000D_
now. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    We can talk about sugar though. I am happy to talk about _x000D_
sugar._x000D_
    Sorry._x000D_
    Again, I apologize for missing your testimony, so some of _x000D_
you may have addressed this. But in 2008, the farm bill _x000D_
authorized a pilot project for local and regional procurement. _x000D_
Do we have a report or data from what that pilot program showed _x000D_
us? And can any of you comment on that?"
2923587,2923586,2923588,19196,6,"    So who is the second country, in terms of _x000D_
providing the most food aid around the world, to the United _x000D_
States? Does anyone know?"
2923588,2923587,2923589,19196,6,    That would have been my guess.
2923589,2923588,2923590,19196,6,"    Okay. And can you also speak to how they _x000D_
provide food aid? Is it similar to what we do in the United _x000D_
States? Or do they more of the local and regional procurement?"
2923590,2923589,2923591,19196,6,"    And finally, Senator Coons raised this _x000D_
issue, but there are vested interests who benefit from the way _x000D_
the current system operates. So where is the most opposition _x000D_
coming from to changing the way the current system works?"
2923591,2923590,2923592,19196,6,"    Certainly, we have heard from the maritime _x000D_
interests. Are there others?"
2923592,2923591,2923593,19196,6,"    And several of you alluded to farmers. I _x000D_
have not heard from any farmers in New Hampshire that they are _x000D_
concerned about changing the way food aid works, but they are _x000D_
probably not benefiting a lot from the current program. So _x000D_
where are farmers on these changes?"
2923593,2923592,2923594,19196,6,"    When you say that, you mean who is _x000D_
speaking for the farmers or who represents the farm industry?"
2923594,2923593,2923595,19196,6,    I believe that.
2923595,2923594,2923596,19196,6,"    Mr. Chairman, can I ask the other two to _x000D_
respond to that?"
2923596,2923595,2923597,19196,6,    Sure.
2923597,2923596,2923598,19196,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Ray."
2923598,2923597,2923599,19196,6,"    Right._x000D_
    Thank you very much."
2923599,2923598,2923600,19196,6,"    Anybody else have any closing questions or _x000D_
comments?_x000D_
    I want to thank all of you for being here. I think this _x000D_
testimony has been outstanding, as has the hearing._x000D_
    My guess is, to follow up on Dr. Smith's comments, I would _x000D_
bet that while there are associations and entities that lobby _x000D_
on behalf of various industries, if you will, I would bet if _x000D_
the members themselves were aware of the negative impact this _x000D_
lobbying was having on people who were starving, I do not _x000D_
believe there would be as much lobbying taking place._x000D_
    I do not think they have any idea that there are paid _x000D_
lobbyists up here that are causing people around the world to _x000D_
starve. I just have greater faith in the American people, _x000D_
greater faith that if these groups they are representing, if _x000D_
the individuals actually knew what was happening, they would be _x000D_
ashamed and they would cause it to stop._x000D_
    So I thank you all for being here._x000D_
    Mr. Ray, thank you for the example your organization is _x000D_
setting._x000D_
    Dr. Mercier, thank you for all your efforts through the _x000D_
years to cause reforms to happen._x000D_
    The meeting will be adjourned, although for questions, the _x000D_
record will remain open through the end of the day Friday._x000D_
    Thank you all for being here."
2923600,2923599,2923601,19197,1,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will come to _x000D_
order. We want to thank our witnesses for being here and, _x000D_
certainly, all of our committee members._x000D_
    I think in lieu of reading my normal opening statement, I _x000D_
just want to make a general statement, and that is that _x000D_
yesterday we had a classified briefing. What we hear in _x000D_
classified briefings about the direction and the signals and _x000D_
all of the things that are occurring in Afghanistan directly _x000D_
contradict some of the rosy public statements that are made _x000D_
about what is happening within the country._x000D_
    I think it is actually alarming to go to a classified _x000D_
session and then to hear reports about those discussions in the _x000D_
Armed Services Committee itself._x000D_
    So with that backdrop, I just want to say to each of you, _x000D_
all of us obviously want our Nation to be successful in its _x000D_
efforts in Afghanistan. I know there has been a debate about _x000D_
the number of troops on the ground. There have been some _x000D_
arbitrary numbers that have been thrown out. I know today we _x000D_
have 9,800 troops there. Yet, from what I can tell yet, we are _x000D_
continuing to lose territory, lose momentum. The status in _x000D_
Afghanistan is today that we are moving in a very negative _x000D_
direction on the ground._x000D_
    So obviously, that is concerning. We know that President _x000D_
Ghani has a vast amount of experience, even though he is _x000D_
somewhat of a technocrat. He knows there are issues that need _x000D_
to be dealt with appropriately within the country._x000D_
    But when you look at all of these security issues that are _x000D_
being dealt with, certainly it takes away from his ability to _x000D_
implement those._x000D_
    So we are concerned about security. I think we are _x000D_
concerned about any type of reconciliation that is taking _x000D_
place. We understand the concerns that exist relative to _x000D_
Pakistan. And let us face it, it is them, to a degree, hedging _x000D_
their bets. But from the outside, as you watch what is _x000D_
happening there, the Taliban is gaining ground, and that is _x000D_
just a fact._x000D_
    So I hope this hearing today, which will obviously be the _x000D_
first public hearing we have had in some time on this topic, _x000D_
will help us be illuminated._x000D_
    We thank both of you very, very much for your service and _x000D_
for being here. And we thank you for your willingness to help _x000D_
us with understanding as to what is actually happening there on _x000D_
the ground._x000D_
    With that, I will turn to Senator Cardin."
2923601,2923600,2923602,19197,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for _x000D_
calling this hearing._x000D_
    I want to thank our witnesses for being here._x000D_
    I want to follow the example of the chairman and just lay _x000D_
out some basic concerns that I think came out not just as a _x000D_
result of yesterday's briefing, but as we have seen of late, _x000D_
and that is on how we are doing on the security front in _x000D_
Afghanistan. It seems like we are losing ground._x000D_
    What happened in Kunduz obviously was a major concern. It _x000D_
showed real shortcomings in the Afghan National Defense and _x000D_
Security Forces to provide security to the region._x000D_
    What have we learned from that? How are we going forward?_x000D_
    Secondly, the reconciliation process, whether there can be _x000D_
a stable government in Afghanistan, representing all the _x000D_
interests of the country, and the role that Pakistan is playing _x000D_
in that regard. Are they a sincere partner in peace, or are _x000D_
they just trying to protect their interests in its relationship _x000D_
in that region?_x000D_
    Third, the development progress in Afghanistan since 2001, _x000D_
the resources that we put into Afghanistan, there certainly has _x000D_
been a question. Their economy is not performing anywhere near _x000D_
a level that would be acceptable for sustainability and _x000D_
progress._x000D_
    Then yesterday in the New York Times, there was an article _x000D_
that raised a question as to whether the Taliban is the key to _x000D_
USAID projects, which I would like to get some answers on as to _x000D_
what are the short-term, long-term gains and whether our _x000D_
investments of U.S. taxpayer dollars are really being _x000D_
beneficial in Afghan's future._x000D_
    Lastly, the anticorruption efforts, we know the President _x000D_
made very strong commitments for anticorruption and yet we see _x000D_
virtually no progress in dealing with the corruption issues in _x000D_
Afghanistan._x000D_
    So I hope what we will do, we have been there for a while, _x000D_
what has gone right? Build on that._x000D_
    We have done a lot of good things in Afghanistan. I think _x000D_
we all acknowledge that. This is not the country it was in _x000D_
2001. That is a positive note._x000D_
    But things have gone wrong. Have we learned from what has _x000D_
gone wrong, so we can make appropriate adjustments to make sure _x000D_
that we have an effective policy for the Afghans' future and _x000D_
U.S. policy interests?_x000D_
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses."
2923602,2923601,2923603,19197,1,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    We will now turn to our witnesses on the first panel. We _x000D_
will hear from two administration witnesses representing the _x000D_
State Department and USAID whose portfolios include both _x000D_
Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our second panel includes three _x000D_
informed experts on Afghanistan and the region. We thank them _x000D_
for being here._x000D_
    So our first witness is the respected Ambassador Richard _x000D_
Olson, the United States Special Representative for Afghanistan _x000D_
and Pakistan, and recently returned as our Ambassador from _x000D_
Islamabad._x000D_
    We thank you very much for a career in public service and _x000D_
Foreign Service, and for being here today._x000D_
    Our second witness is Donald L. Sampler Jr., assistant to _x000D_
the administrator for Pakistan and Afghanistan for USAID. We _x000D_
thank you for what you and your cohorts do around the world to _x000D_
further U.S. interests._x000D_
    So with that, Ambassador Olson, if you would begin, we _x000D_
would appreciate it._x000D_
    I would just say, as a courtesy to my fellow panelists _x000D_
here, the deadline on a couple of issues is 21 minutes relative _x000D_
to the other thing we are working on. I may step in and out a _x000D_
little bit and miss a little bit, not out of disrespect. Thank _x000D_
you."
2923603,2923602,2923604,19197,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Sampler."
2923604,2923603,2923605,19197,3,"    Thank you very much for that testimony. I am _x000D_
going to do some interaction along the way and turn at present _x000D_
to Senator Cardin for questions."
2923605,2923604,2923606,19197,3,"    Once again, thank you both for the role _x000D_
that you have played in the development and Afghanistan. It is, _x000D_
certainly, a much different country than it was in 2001. A lot _x000D_
of progress has been made._x000D_
    But there is reason for concern about its future, so let me _x000D_
ask a couple questions._x000D_
    Ambassador Olson, first, let me ask, what are the lessons _x000D_
learned from Kunduz? Have we made strategic changes in the _x000D_
security arrangements in order to prevent a similar episode _x000D_
from occurring in the future?"
2923606,2923605,2923607,19197,3,"    Mr. Sampler, let me turn to the question I _x000D_
raised during my opening comments, the troubling article that I _x000D_
read in the New York Times that indicates USAID programs are _x000D_
maybe dependent upon Taliban support and, therefore, Taliban _x000D_
getting more support as a result of USAID, perhaps _x000D_
strengthening their hold, contrary to our objective in the _x000D_
tribal areas._x000D_
    There are short-term gains to try to help in regard to our _x000D_
military objectives. There are long-term development goals that _x000D_
we are trying to achieve in Afghanistan. When we confuse the _x000D_
two, sometimes we get into trouble._x000D_
    Are we getting our dollar's value? And is there any truth _x000D_
to the report that the Taliban is taking credit for the aid _x000D_
coming into tribal areas?"
2923607,2923606,2923608,19197,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Ambassador Olson, I do not think we are going to make _x000D_
progress in Afghanistan unless we really have changes in _x000D_
anticorruption activities. I know the President has made pretty _x000D_
strong statements about fighting corruption, but we have not _x000D_
seen much action in fighting corruption. A later witness will _x000D_
give us some specific recommendations, such as a confirmed _x000D_
Attorney General or providing a strong monitoring and _x000D_
evaluation committee, passing laws that provide stronger _x000D_
penalties, and implementing the EITI._x000D_
    Do you have a game plan for holding Afghanistan to _x000D_
accountability on their anticorruption efforts and not just the _x000D_
statement of the President, which I think is sincere but has _x000D_
not been backed by any action?"
2923608,2923607,2923609,19197,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923609,2923608,2923610,19197,3,    Senator Perdue?
2923610,2923609,2923611,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    I thank both of you for your service. But I want to focus _x000D_
on a couple reports that are just coming out._x000D_
    I was there in April, and I was honored to meet with _x000D_
General Campbell, President Ghani, CEO Abdullah, and our _x000D_
Ambassador, Ambassador McKinney. I have to tell you, just some _x000D_
7 or 8 months later, it is shocking to see the difference in _x000D_
taking two Polaroid shots of the situation._x000D_
    They were just getting ready to go into the fighting _x000D_
season. Of course, now, General Campbell, just last month or in _x000D_
October, said, and this was in testimony to Congress: There was _x000D_
no winter lull this year in fighting. Since February, the _x000D_
fighting has been almost continuous. The violence has moved _x000D_
beyond traditional insurgent strongholds such that today over _x000D_
half of the 398 districts are under high or extreme Taliban _x000D_
threat today._x000D_
    I am coming to a quick question, but Kunduz, we know about. _x000D_
Then the Pentagon today just released its report to Congress. I _x000D_
know we do not have a DOD rep here, but I want to get from the _x000D_
State Department your perspective on that only that report, but _x000D_
the situation as it stands right now._x000D_
    Their report says that Taliban attacks, we have higher _x000D_
casualties of Afghan forces. The Afghan-Pakistani border region _x000D_
is a haven for various groups. I was shocked at the number of _x000D_
groups it talks about in that report._x000D_
    Then Dr. Fred Kagan recently in an AEI report testified _x000D_
that he is not real sure, and I quote, ``not confident that _x000D_
there will actually be an Afghanistan when our next President _x000D_
takes office.'' That is a severe description of the picture._x000D_
    But given the situation right now, and the fact that the _x000D_
military in Afghanistan has some 180,000 troops. We still have _x000D_
9,800. General Campbell won the argument. But we are moving to _x000D_
a situation where we are about to have 5,000 or so U.S. troops _x000D_
there._x000D_
    My question is, what does next year look like? What does _x000D_
this fighting season look like? How deep is this threat?_x000D_
    ISIS has grown dramatically, as we see in the reports, just _x000D_
since April. In April, it was not even a major conversation. _x000D_
Now it is a primary part of any dialogue you have with people _x000D_
in Afghanistan._x000D_
    So from the State Department perspective, what is our _x000D_
strategy right now in Afghanistan?"
2923611,2923610,2923612,19197,3,"    So we are moving toward a negotiation? So _x000D_
there really is not a strategy being talked about, about how to _x000D_
defeat the Taliban? Is that what I hear?"
2923612,2923611,2923613,19197,3,"    Can I ask you briefly, with the time _x000D_
remaining? The Iranian influence with the Taliban has grown _x000D_
this year, according to several reports. Can you speak to that? _x000D_
And what is the Afghan Government doing? And as a corollary to _x000D_
that, we know there has been outreach from Kabul to Moscow._x000D_
    From a State Department perspective, can you speak to both _x000D_
of those, Iranian support for the Taliban, the growth of ISIS, _x000D_
and then the third piece, the overtures that Afghanistan is _x000D_
making to Moscow?"
2923613,2923612,2923614,19197,3,    Thank you.
2923614,2923613,2923615,19197,3,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Murphy?"
2923615,2923614,2923616,19197,3,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    If you believe in the limits of American power as a _x000D_
catalyst for change abroad absent a local commitment to do so, _x000D_
the last 15 years in Afghanistan are, certainly, proof of that _x000D_
concept. You guys have really hard jobs, and I am glad that you _x000D_
are here briefing us._x000D_
    But, Ambassador Olson, you talked about this idea that we _x000D_
are prepared to hold Afghans accountable for their lack of _x000D_
progress on anticorruption efforts. With all due respect, I do _x000D_
not think there is any evidence to suggest that is actually _x000D_
true. I do not think, over the last 15 years, there is any _x000D_
evidence to suggest that the United States is willing to do _x000D_
things and send messages to the Afghans to telegraph that we _x000D_
are serious in any way, shape, or form about them getting _x000D_
serious about anticorruption efforts._x000D_
    We seem to have made an independent decision that we have _x000D_
national security interests at stake in Afghanistan, that we _x000D_
are going to commit the amount of resources necessary to stop _x000D_
Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven again for terrorists, _x000D_
and that we are going to prioritize that, which involves a _x000D_
significant amount of American resources there, with or without _x000D_
a commitment from the Afghan Government to sort their own mess _x000D_
out._x000D_
    So it seems to me, having gone to Afghanistan four times, _x000D_
five times, having heard the same story over and over again _x000D_
about how we were pressuring them to take on corruption, and _x000D_
how little progress we have seen, that we should just admit _x000D_
that our priority is actually not to encourage local political _x000D_
change. Our priority is to commit just enough resources to stop _x000D_
Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for _x000D_
terrorists and admit that that is ultimately our number one _x000D_
priority. And it means that it often forces the secondary goal _x000D_
of local political change to become subverted to that first _x000D_
priority._x000D_
    I am sure you think I am wrong. But tell me why, for those _x000D_
of us have heard people tell us that we are going to start _x000D_
holding Afghans accountable for lack of progress on corruption, _x000D_
why any of us should believe that we are actually ever prepared _x000D_
to send the tough message to them necessary to get them to _x000D_
change."
2923616,2923615,2923617,19197,3,"    Well, let me ask another question. You can _x000D_
maybe answer this one as well._x000D_
    Then I would be interested for you to articulate what you _x000D_
think has given the Taliban this political space in which to _x000D_
operate. If you read through the litany of progress that we _x000D_
absolutely have made on the number of Afghans who have access _x000D_
to schooling, to the number of homes that now have access to _x000D_
electricity, that should suggest a level of economic stability _x000D_
and economic opportunity that would give local populations _x000D_
faith in aligning themselves with local, regional, or federal _x000D_
governance. They are not doing that, which suggests that the _x000D_
political space is being created perhaps by a lack of faith in _x000D_
the legitimacy of government because of corruption._x000D_
    So it is sort of hard, again, from your perspective, from _x000D_
USAID's perspective, to hear all this progress we have made, _x000D_
but then to have no evidence that it is actually resulting in _x000D_
less support for the Taliban when you look at the breadth of _x000D_
their operations over the course of the year._x000D_
    So I guess I would be interested from your perspective in _x000D_
terms of what you think is giving the Taliban the political _x000D_
space, if you accept the notion that there has been a lot of _x000D_
progress made in terms of the programming that we have _x000D_
delivered."
2923617,2923616,2923618,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923618,2923617,2923619,19197,3,    Senator Barrasso?
2923619,2923618,2923620,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Ambassador Olson, I want to talk a little bit about what is _x000D_
happening with ISIS. You were just in Afghanistan last week. I _x000D_
was there for Thanksgiving, up in northern Afghanistan, and _x000D_
hearing more and more about the spread of ISIS across the _x000D_
Middle East. It is obviously a serious concern to us in regard _x000D_
to national security._x000D_
    Yesterday, the Department of Defense warned about the _x000D_
growth of ISIS in Afghanistan. The report from the Department _x000D_
of Defense stated that ISIS ``has progressed from its initial _x000D_
exploratory phase to a point where they are openly fighting the _x000D_
Taliban for establishment of a safe haven and are becoming more _x000D_
operationally active.''_x000D_
    It went on to say that ISIS has claimed responsibility for _x000D_
the IED attacks against United Nations vehicles, attacks _x000D_
against 10 checkpoints. In September when I was in Kabul, as _x000D_
you know, they are not taking vehicles back and forth to the _x000D_
Embassy. Things are now by helicopter, because of this _x000D_
increased concern._x000D_
    Can you talk about the best estimates on the number of ISIS _x000D_
fighters in Afghanistan?"
2923620,2923619,2923621,19197,3,"    I wonder if you can help us because I _x000D_
heard the same thing when I was there, and I asked some of _x000D_
these questions. It was the same thing, that some of these are _x000D_
disaffected Taliban members heading over to ISIS._x000D_
    The issue of pay came up. Can you talk a little bit about _x000D_
how different people are paid differently in Afghanistan? The _x000D_
pecking order seemed to be that ISIS was getting the most _x000D_
money, the people who were willing to fight for ISIS. Then the _x000D_
next level down from there was the Taliban. The level below _x000D_
that was the Afghan army. The level below that were the Afghan _x000D_
police._x000D_
    So for people who are focused on the monetary aspects of _x000D_
this, there was actually a pecking order of which side you were _x000D_
on and how much you got paid."
2923621,2923620,2923622,19197,3,"    Do you see any evidence that either _x000D_
Taliban or ISIS is interested in actually governing _x000D_
Afghanistan? Or do they simply want to be left alone in their _x000D_
own safe havens? Or create more problems?"
2923622,2923621,2923623,19197,3,    Yes.
2923623,2923622,2923624,19197,3,"    In terms of troop level, and Senator _x000D_
Perdue asked specifically about the troop level of the 9,800 _x000D_
troops currently in until the end of 2016. Originally, it was _x000D_
only about 1,000 troops by the end of 2016._x000D_
    Given the current security situation and increased _x000D_
violence, does the State Department believe that the United _x000D_
States should go down to 5,500 troops after 2016 or 1,000? What _x000D_
are your thoughts on the numbers?"
2923624,2923623,2923625,19197,3,"    And just a final question. Can you just _x000D_
give me your assessment of the Afghan National Security Forces?"
2923625,2923624,2923626,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Ambassador._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923626,2923625,2923627,19197,3,    Senator Kaine?
2923627,2923626,2923628,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you to the witnesses. It is a very, very _x000D_
challenging service._x000D_
    And I appreciated, Mr. Sampler, your going into some of the _x000D_
metrics of improved quality of life in Afghanistan that have _x000D_
been achieved with a tremendous amount of work by Americans and _x000D_
coalition partners._x000D_
    I especially appreciated that you acknowledged the service _x000D_
of our troops but also of all the civilians, USAID, NGOs. I _x000D_
mean, it has been a comprehensive effort. Things like the life _x000D_
expectancy expansion are nearly revolutionary, if you look at _x000D_
what that has meant to Afghanistan._x000D_
    But I know we all want that progress to not be a temporary _x000D_
phenomenon and to continue. That is why we are here._x000D_
    One of the things that troubles me, I think the chairman in _x000D_
his opening comments talked about the divergence between what _x000D_
we often hear about Afghanistan in classified and unclassified _x000D_
settings. I had an opportunity yesterday to be with others in a _x000D_
classified setting on Afghanistan._x000D_
    I was struck by the divergence between different classified _x000D_
settings I go to, and, in particular, the divergence between _x000D_
classified information conveyed by folks in the intel community _x000D_
versus classified information conveyed by folks in the armed _x000D_
services community. I am on the Armed Services Committee, too._x000D_
    I think a little bit of tension between the intel community _x000D_
approach and the armed services approach is not that unusual. _x000D_
But I will say, and I have only been here 3 years, but in 3 _x000D_
years here, I have never heard as broad of a divergence. And I _x000D_
do not even really think I can say the issues without _x000D_
jeopardizing what may be classified. But I do not think I have _x000D_
heard as broad of a divergence between classified accounts _x000D_
between the intel community and the armed services community in _x000D_
any other instance except current status of a number of issues, _x000D_
really important, really fundamental, really critical issues, _x000D_
about the state of affairs in Afghanistan. It is very, very _x000D_
troubling._x000D_
    Let me ask you a couple questions. You each have joint _x000D_
billets with Afghanistan and Pakistan. I am really interested _x000D_
in your thoughts about the current Afghanistan and Pakistan _x000D_
relationship. It does not have to be from a classified _x000D_
briefing. We know from public accounting of Taliban activity in _x000D_
Pakistan that Taliban have used Pakistan as a safe haven over _x000D_
time, and there is a very important degree to which Pakistan's _x000D_
cooperation with Afghanistan and vice versa is critical to _x000D_
stability in Afghanistan._x000D_
    What is your current perception, from each of your _x000D_
respective roles, about the degree of cooperation between the _x000D_
Afghan and Pakistan governments, especially when it comes to _x000D_
these issues of security and the counterterrorism effort?"
2923628,2923627,2923629,19197,3,"    Please, Mr. Sampler. Then I have one more _x000D_
question."
2923629,2923628,2923630,19197,3,    Thank you.
2923630,2923629,2923631,19197,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Udall?"
2923631,2923630,2923632,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you both for your service to the country. We _x000D_
really appreciate all the hard work in what are very, very _x000D_
difficult circumstances._x000D_
    Ambassador Olson, you mention in your opening statement _x000D_
that the administration remains committed to a stable and _x000D_
secure Afghanistan, and we remain convinced that a negotiated _x000D_
settlement between the Government of Afghanistan and the _x000D_
Taliban is the surest way to end the conflict._x000D_
    I have the same impression that Senator Kaine does, I am _x000D_
not on the Armed Services Committee, but that there is a very _x000D_
stark difference here between some of the intelligence._x000D_
    But that aside, let me ask, if we are wanting to get them _x000D_
to the peace table in this Afghan-led peace process, does the _x000D_
Taliban not have to be at a point in their situation in the _x000D_
conflict where they feel there is a reason for them to come to _x000D_
the table? Looking at it, from my perspective, your testimony _x000D_
and others here, they are resurgent. They are doing better. _x000D_
They are capturing cities. They are releasing people from _x000D_
prisons. They are making major gains. And we are drawing down _x000D_
our forces._x000D_
    Convince me that they really want, in good faith, to come _x000D_
to the table. The question is addressed to both of you."
2923632,2923631,2923633,19197,3,"    Mr. Sampler, do you have any comment on the _x000D_
sides of this from your perspective, from AID, that indicate to _x000D_
you that there is a real sincere effort on the part of the _x000D_
Taliban to be a part of a peace process?"
2923633,2923632,2923634,19197,3,"    As you talk about economic development, _x000D_
security has affected Afghanistan's economic--I am trying to _x000D_
probe now on their economic outlook. What is the status of some _x000D_
of the major mining, energy, and other capital projects that _x000D_
investors such as China and India have subscribed to? What _x000D_
projects are underway in producing revenue, if any? Which _x000D_
projects are stalled? And why are they stalled?_x000D_
    You talked about the exports to Pakistan. I am talking _x000D_
about these bigger projects that you are aware of, I am sure."
2923634,2923633,2923635,19197,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Please, Ambassador?"
2923635,2923634,2923636,19197,3,"    Our India or China involved in either one of _x000D_
those?"
2923636,2923635,2923637,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923637,2923636,2923638,19197,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Isakson?"
2923638,2923637,2923639,19197,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize. I _x000D_
had to go in and out, so I missed some of the questions. I may _x000D_
be redundant, and I apologize for that._x000D_
    Mr. Sampler, did you serve at USAID when we were in Iraq?"
2923639,2923638,2923640,19197,3,"    Were you ever part of the Provincial _x000D_
Reconstruction Teams or that effort that took place?"
2923640,2923639,2923641,19197,3,"    Were you ever part of the Provincial _x000D_
Reconstruction Teams?"
2923641,2923640,2923642,19197,3,"    You served in Baghdad._x000D_
    Mr. Olson, were you involved when we were involved in Iraq?"
2923642,2923641,2923643,19197,3,"    Correct me if I am wrong, but my _x000D_
recollection of our--and the title of this hearing is ``The _x000D_
Administration Strategy in Afghanistan,'' but I want to reflect _x000D_
back to Iraq for a second and my experience there._x000D_
    Our strategy in Iraq obviously was to stabilize the country _x000D_
through the use of soft power and things like USAID and _x000D_
Provincial Reconstruction Teams to win the people over, leave _x000D_
enough of a residual force to have security in the country, _x000D_
hopefully win them over to be an independent, free democracy in _x000D_
a very dangerous part of the world._x000D_
    Was that about right to describe our strategy?"
2923643,2923642,2923644,19197,3,"    It is not a trick question. Feel free to _x000D_
correct me, if I am wrong. I am trying to get to a point."
2923644,2923643,2923645,19197,3,"    What worries me, I read General Campbell's _x000D_
statements about the growth of ISIL, and the growth and _x000D_
strength of the Taliban, and reflected back to Iraq. I walked _x000D_
in the streets of Gazaria with a U.S. rifle company that was _x000D_
handing out microloans, and we are helping small businesses _x000D_
grow through the PRTs. We really were winning the country over, _x000D_
and then we left. Our military presence left, and ISIL came in._x000D_
    Now I know the President has decided to leave 5,000, I _x000D_
believe that is the right number, troops in Afghanistan. Is _x000D_
that not correct? Is that enough to prevent what happened in _x000D_
Iraq from happening again in Afghanistan, where there is so _x000D_
little protection that we cannot let the soft power we want to _x000D_
use to win the people over actually take hold in terms of our _x000D_
strategy? That is the question I am getting to."
2923645,2923644,2923646,19197,3,"    I really appreciate that answer. This is _x000D_
an observation I will make where I maybe also will be very _x000D_
wrong._x000D_
    But the reason Afghanistan has been at war for 300 years is _x000D_
because of that strong sense of national unity. They want to be _x000D_
in control of their own destiny and fought whoever tried to _x000D_
control them. Is that correct?"
2923646,2923645,2923647,19197,3,"    National unity is one of the contributing _x000D_
factors, is it not?"
2923647,2923646,2923648,19197,3,"    Thanks to both of you for your service, _x000D_
and thank you for answering the questions._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923648,2923647,2923649,19197,3,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    I know we are about to close out and we have another panel._x000D_
    Just out of curiosity, to follow up a little bit on Senator _x000D_
Kaine's comments about the diverging views, I will say, for _x000D_
what it is worth--I had a private meeting with you, Ambassador _x000D_
Olson. We had the classified briefing. For what it is worth, _x000D_
while you obviously speak in a more statesmanlike manner, the _x000D_
views of what is happening in Afghanistan were very aligned. I _x000D_
mean, the meeting we had in our office, the classified briefing _x000D_
yesterday, was very much aligned. I mean, we have some issues _x000D_
we need to deal with._x000D_
    Why do you think there is that divergent view on the other _x000D_
side that takes place? I know that you work closely with our _x000D_
armed services. How could it be, as involved as you are there, _x000D_
both of you, that we have an alignment over here at the State _x000D_
Department with our intelligence, but a disalignment, if you _x000D_
will, over on the other sectors?"
2923649,2923648,2923650,19197,3,"    I actually found alignments we had yesterday _x000D_
to be very good._x000D_
    The Taliban issue, now obviously we came into Afghanistan _x000D_
in 2001. The issue was to end the Taliban's existence and _x000D_
dominion over government at the time. Now they are changing the _x000D_
facts on the ground. Is that fair?"
2923650,2923649,2923651,19197,3,"    And there are discussions about, over time, _x000D_
we have made some accommodating comments publicly, our _x000D_
government has, relative to their potential involvement in the _x000D_
government down the road. Is that fair to say?"
2923651,2923650,2923652,19197,3,"    And I know that I was stepping in and out, _x000D_
and I greatly apologize for that. My understanding is a _x000D_
statement was made that, at present, they are not exhibiting _x000D_
the characteristics that would be appropriate for them to be a _x000D_
part of that. Is that correct?"
2923652,2923651,2923653,19197,3,"    So that is the end state that the Afghan _x000D_
Government is working toward. I think it is good that we have _x000D_
not established preconditions ourselves._x000D_
    What would be, though, the characteristics, the Taliban _x000D_
would need to exhibit from your standpoint to be a legitimate _x000D_
entity for the Afghan Government to begin negotiations with?"
2923653,2923652,2923654,19197,3,    Yes. Your observation would be?
2923654,2923653,2923655,19197,3,"    And do you think, based on what you know, the _x000D_
Taliban has the capacity to reject terrorism and violence?"
2923655,2923654,2923656,19197,3,"    A couple more just brief questions._x000D_
    We had a decent meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan _x000D_
and their military leadership. They gave us strongly worded _x000D_
statements about the ISI involvement and how 1,000 percent they _x000D_
are committed to dealing with the Taliban, dealing with other _x000D_
groups that are housed in the FATA region and, certainly, _x000D_
ensuring that they did everything they could to make sure that _x000D_
Afghanistan was stabilized._x000D_
    On the other hand, I get a strong sense that is maybe not _x000D_
100 percent accurate. They are watching what is happening on _x000D_
the ground. They want to have the proper relationship, if you _x000D_
will, with the ultimate leadership group that exists in _x000D_
Afghanistan. What they are seeing right now is a situation _x000D_
where they are not sure what that outcome is going to be._x000D_
    My sense is that instead of them actually carrying out what _x000D_
they said here in our presence, that they are hedging their _x000D_
bets. They are trying to calculate, if you will, what _x000D_
Afghanistan is going to be over time._x000D_
    Right now, we have 9,800 troops ourselves in Afghanistan. _x000D_
There has been a sort of arbitrary date of numbers of troops _x000D_
that will be there over the course of this next year, I think _x000D_
dropping down to about 5,000._x000D_
    But it seems to me that we have our hands full as is, that _x000D_
it is incredibly difficult for us to keep violence down and _x000D_
stability in place at present._x000D_
    Just out of curiosity, does that raise questions to you as _x000D_
to when we need to be deciding ultimately what our security _x000D_
force totals are going to be in Afghanistan?"
2923656,2923655,2923657,19197,3,    What about the second part of the question?
2923657,2923656,2923658,19197,3,"    I have no desire, out of respect to you--you _x000D_
and I may have traveled together to the Waziristans, if I _x000D_
remember correctly."
2923658,2923657,2923659,19197,3,"    I do not want in any way try to create a _x000D_
divergence between you and the administration. But let us just _x000D_
say at present, things could change, certainly, between now and _x000D_
the end of the year._x000D_
    Our security forces have their hands full in working with _x000D_
the Afghan military to try to create a secure environment. Is _x000D_
that correct?"
2923659,2923658,2923660,19197,3,"    At the moment._x000D_
    Listen, I certainly appreciate your service. I appreciated _x000D_
your candor yesterday in our office. I appreciate the service _x000D_
you provided in multiple settings._x000D_
    Certainly, you all have been helpful to us today. I do _x000D_
think that it would be fair to say, based on the entirety of _x000D_
yesterday, today, just other interactions we have, we should _x000D_
all be very concerned about outcomes in Afghanistan and _x000D_
understand that tremendous diligence and effort is still _x000D_
necessary, and leadership on their part, to cause a successful _x000D_
outcome to occur._x000D_
    Would you agree?"
2923660,2923659,2923661,19197,3,"    Thank you, both. I appreciate it._x000D_
    We will now ask the second panel to take their place. We _x000D_
thank all of you for being here._x000D_
    Our first witness today will be the former U.S. Ambassador _x000D_
to Afghanistan, James Cunningham, someone we all know well, now _x000D_
a senior fellow and the Khalilzad Chair on Afghanistan at the _x000D_
South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council._x000D_
    We thank you for being here._x000D_
    The second witness will be former Afghan Minister Mr. Ali _x000D_
Jalali._x000D_
    Thank you so much for being here. We all know you also._x000D_
    He is now a distinguished professor at the Near East and _x000D_
South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense _x000D_
University._x000D_
    Our third witness will be Jodi Vittori, a senior policy _x000D_
adviser at Global Witness, who has also served in the U.S. _x000D_
military in Afghanistan--we thank you for that service--and in _x000D_
countering corruption in the defense and security sector, which _x000D_
I know there is a big job._x000D_
    So we thank you all for being here. We think this is a very _x000D_
distinguished panel. If you could keep your comments to around _x000D_
5 minutes, without objection, your written testimony will be _x000D_
entered into the record._x000D_
    If we could, we can go in the order of introduction, _x000D_
starting with you, Ambassador Cunningham."
2923661,2923660,2923662,19197,4,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    I want to apologize to all of you. We have an omni bill _x000D_
that was just produced last night about 12 o'clock. Today, _x000D_
there are still discussions that are underway. As I step in and _x000D_
out, it is not out of lack of interest on this topic. We are _x000D_
going to be out of here this week with a massive piece of _x000D_
legislation that is passed, and we apologize for attending to _x000D_
that, which, by the way, parts of affect Afghanistan, too."
2923662,2923661,2923663,19197,4,"    I thought it was all finished. If I knew it _x000D_
was still open, I would be out there also. [Laughter.]"
2923663,2923662,2923664,19197,4,    That is a secret we are keeping. [Laughter.]
2923664,2923663,2923665,19197,4,"    Mr. Jalali, thank you."
2923665,2923664,2923666,19197,5,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    Dr. Vittori?_x000D_
_x000D_
   STATEMENT OF JODI VITTORI, SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, GLOBAL _x000D_
                   WITNESS, WASHINGTON, D."
2923666,2923665,2923667,19197,6,"    I thank all three of you. We appreciate it. _x000D_
We are privileged to have the opportunity to have people like _x000D_
you before us. Again, we thank you for your time and _x000D_
preparation in being here._x000D_
    Ambassador Cunningham, I think people would say you worked _x000D_
for one of the most difficult people ever when you were working _x000D_
with President Karzai. We ended up with the Ghani government, _x000D_
which I think most people believe is a pretty good outcome for _x000D_
Afghanistan._x000D_
    I know there are a number of things that he needs to put in _x000D_
place. I know he is a technocrat, probably not quite as much of _x000D_
a politician as Karzai was, but understands things about good _x000D_
governance and corruption and those kinds of issues._x000D_
    But at the same time, it is going to be very difficult for _x000D_
him to be successful, is it not, unless there is a secure _x000D_
environment there? I mean, I think, at the end of the day, that _x000D_
is the number one thing that will inhibit his ability to be _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    I would like you to speak to that, but also, are there _x000D_
additional diplomatic and/or other tools that you think we as a _x000D_
Nation in current times are not utilizing properly?"
2923667,2923666,2923668,19197,6,"    Mr. Jalali, I do not know what numbers are _x000D_
public and what numbers are not public, so, like Senator Kaine, _x000D_
I want to be very careful. But at a minimum, there is a massive _x000D_
turnover rate in the military. I do not even want to speak to _x000D_
what the official numbers are, but they were very large, at a _x000D_
minimum._x000D_
    I know that you have discussed the need for us to be there _x000D_
under this same arrangement for 5 years. Is that correct, in _x000D_
your written testimony? I think all of us, whenever we go to _x000D_
Afghanistan, we are taken to where the Afghan military is being _x000D_
trained, and we are seeing the maneuvers they are going _x000D_
through. While we appreciate the fact that people in _x000D_
Afghanistan are good fighters, it is hard to detect a real _x000D_
commitment and professionalism in that regard._x000D_
    I am just wondering if you could speak to the turnover rate _x000D_
and also the things we need to do over the next 5 years to _x000D_
ensure that Ghani is able to be successful and/or his _x000D_
successor."
2923668,2923667,2923669,19197,6,"    I know my time is up, and I obviously want to _x000D_
be courteous to the other members._x000D_
    Culturally, what is happening within the Afghan military _x000D_
where we have such a high percentage of people who leave each _x000D_
year, that then cause us--again to keep the numbers that we _x000D_
have in mind, we have a massive amount of training that we have _x000D_
each year. Therefore, you lack the experience on the ground _x000D_
that otherwise would be the case."
2923669,2923668,2923670,19197,6,    Ninety percent of the forces.
2923670,2923669,2923671,19197,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Dr. Vittori, I know others will ask you questions, I am _x000D_
sure, about corruption. We know that is a massive issue in the _x000D_
country. And, obviously, it cannot go forward productively _x000D_
without dealing with that. Thank you for being here._x000D_
    Senator Cardin?"
2923671,2923670,2923672,19197,6,"    That is what I am going to ask about. Thank _x000D_
you._x000D_
    First of all, all three of you, thank you very much. I _x000D_
agree with the chairman. I found your written testimony and _x000D_
your presentations here to be very, very helpful for us to _x000D_
truly understand the challenges that we have in Afghanistan._x000D_
    So I think today's hearing has been very helpful, both _x000D_
panels._x000D_
    I want to try to drill down for all three as to what the _x000D_
United States can do in its policy in order to try to advance _x000D_
the issues that you raised in your individual presentations._x000D_
    Dr. Vittori, I tell you, I found your statement to be _x000D_
extremely helpful in a roadmap to what Afghanistan needs to do _x000D_
to fight corruption. You were pretty specific as to ways that _x000D_
we could advance that through the tools we have available in _x000D_
our toolkit._x000D_
    Could you give me perhaps your first, your second, or third _x000D_
priorities as to where you would like to see the United States _x000D_
concentrate for change in Afghanistan to fight corruption?"
2923672,2923671,2923673,19197,6,    That is your top priority?
2923673,2923672,2923674,19197,6,"    I think that is very helpful. I agree with _x000D_
your statement, and I think you do give us a roadmap for how we _x000D_
need to try to develop the U.S. role in Afghanistan in fighting _x000D_
corruption, because it is very much related to security of the _x000D_
country, the economic future of the country, and everything _x000D_
else._x000D_
    Ambassador Cunningham, In your statement you put your _x000D_
finger on the principal challenge with Pakistan as it relates _x000D_
to Afghanistan. I am quoting from your testimony, ``The test _x000D_
will be whether Pakistan takes concrete actions not only to _x000D_
support reconciliation, but to reduce the ability of the _x000D_
Taliban and the Haqqani network to plan and launch operations _x000D_
from Pakistan, which greatly diminishes the prospects for real _x000D_
negotiations.''_x000D_
    To understate it, we have a complicated relationship with _x000D_
Pakistan. What can the United States do in its bilateral with _x000D_
Pakistan to further the prospects for reconciliation and peace _x000D_
in Afghanistan?"
2923674,2923673,2923675,19197,6,"    Well, I look forward to your active _x000D_
engagement as a private citizen on this issue, because we need _x000D_
to figure this out. I mean, it is so challenging. Some of our _x000D_
private discussions are so much different than the public _x000D_
discussions. The reality is, unless we have a constructive role _x000D_
by Pakistan here, it is going to be very difficult to see the _x000D_
reconciliation move forward. So I appreciate your comments on _x000D_
that._x000D_
    Mr. Jalali, I also appreciate you being here. I am just _x000D_
going to acknowledge that your statement that the key factor in _x000D_
improving prospects for sustained political economic and _x000D_
security cooperation with the National Unity Government is to _x000D_
implement the promised structural electoral and functional _x000D_
reforms with the Afghan state. I think that is absolutely _x000D_
essential. It deals also with Dr. Vittori's comments and _x000D_
Ambassador Cunningham's._x000D_
    It really is a question of whether we can put confidence in _x000D_
the reforms in Afghanistan that can really bring in all sectors _x000D_
of Afghanistan for security and economic prosperity._x000D_
    So I thank all three of you again for your testimony. I can _x000D_
assure you it has had an impact on our committee."
2923675,2923674,2923676,19197,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Kaine?"
2923676,2923675,2923677,19197,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you to the witnesses. I have a lot of questions, _x000D_
but am just going to ask one that intrigues me. ``The _x000D_
Administration's Strategy in Afghanistan'' is the title. One _x000D_
key element of the administration strategy was successful _x000D_
elections at the end of the Karzai tenure year. There were _x000D_
efforts to destabilize those elections that were generally _x000D_
unsuccessful, so that was a positive._x000D_
    But then the election led to a result that was a potential _x000D_
disaster, a stalemate. The U.S. played an important role. The _x000D_
administration played an important role in helping to broker _x000D_
the formation of the partnership between President Ghani and _x000D_
CEO Abdullah. The title chosen was the National Unity _x000D_
Government, which sets a pretty high standard._x000D_
    It seems to me that virtually all of the issues we are _x000D_
talking about today, whether the security issues, or whether _x000D_
anticorruption activity, or whether the right relationship vis-_x000D_
a-vis Pakistan, all of these depend upon the National Unity _x000D_
Government being a national unity government._x000D_
    So I would just like each of you to offer, from your own _x000D_
perspectives, a year plus into this, how cohesive and _x000D_
professional is the working relationship between Ghani and _x000D_
Abdullah, and their constituents? If you want to share _x000D_
positives and negatives, or positives and work that remains to _x000D_
be done, I am really interested in that dynamic a year-plus in."
2923677,2923676,2923678,19197,6,"    We do not know anything about that kind of _x000D_
election."
2923678,2923677,2923679,19197,6,"    I was going to say, they learned well."
2923679,2923678,2923680,19197,7,"    Mr. Cunningham, you are such an important _x000D_
part of a really successful negotiation. I think it was a huge _x000D_
coup with your role, Secretary Kerry's role, and others, in _x000D_
trying to promote the formation of the unity government to get _x000D_
over the electoral impasse._x000D_
    Your sense of it a year in I am quite interested in._x000D_
    And, Mr. Jalali, thank you for your thoughts. I really _x000D_
appreciate that."
2923680,2923679,2923681,19197,7,"    Mr. Chair, I am over time, but can I ask Dr. _x000D_
Vittori to address it please?"
2923681,2923680,2923682,19197,7,    Sure.
2923682,2923681,2923683,19197,7,    Thank you.
2923683,2923682,2923684,19197,7,"    Thank you very much. You have answered from _x000D_
different directions, but there are some consistent themes _x000D_
among the three answers. I appreciate your testimony._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chair."
2923684,2923683,2923685,19197,7,"    We are about at that time, but I just want to _x000D_
follow up a little bit on that. I know when we go into a _x000D_
culture, and we want to make things happen quickly, we _x000D_
obviously are dealing with a culture where they are at that _x000D_
moment. We hope to have things put in place over time that _x000D_
cause corruption and other kinds of things to dissipate and go _x000D_
away. But when we begin, we are dealing with a culture as it _x000D_
is._x000D_
    I am just wondering if there are any lessons learned that _x000D_
you might be willing to share with us. When we enter a country _x000D_
like this on the front, do we sometimes send mixed signals _x000D_
relative to our actions in trying to generate immediate _x000D_
outcomes and our rhetoric as to what we want to see them do _x000D_
over time?_x000D_
    That is you, Doctor."
2923685,2923684,2923686,19197,7,"    Well, you gave the answer that I thought you _x000D_
would give._x000D_
    When we go in, we go in to a crisis mode. We want things to _x000D_
happen quickly. I think, again, we establish on the front end _x000D_
that--and I understand this may be out of necessity--but we _x000D_
start building on the existing culture of corruption, _x000D_
especially when you are dealing with people like we had in _x000D_
leadership there up until recent times._x000D_
    It just perpetuates that. It is almost I guess a joke. We _x000D_
hear the stories of our guys going in to meet with a former _x000D_
leader there about corruption, and then right behind him would _x000D_
be somebody coming in with suitcases, as you were talking _x000D_
about._x000D_
    So I think it is real challenge for us._x000D_
    On that note, moving back to the Ambassador, since you are _x000D_
on the private-sector side now and utilizing your experiences _x000D_
around the world to help look at things in a new way, just _x000D_
briefly, at 30,000 feet, do you have any advice for those of us _x000D_
who still are here on the inside as it relates to going into _x000D_
countries like Afghanistan, like Iraq, potentially portions of _x000D_
Syria, if you will? Any advice to us as we look at trying to _x000D_
reconfigure those, if you will, in our own image?"
2923686,2923685,2923687,19197,7,"    Just to refresh our memory, those time spans, _x000D_
the years were?"
2923687,2923686,2923688,19197,7,    Damaging to their society.
2923688,2923687,2923689,19197,7,"    Listen, you all have been very, very helpful. _x000D_
We thank you for the service you have provided our Nation and _x000D_
the service you are providing now on the outside. Hopefully, _x000D_
you will be back up to help us again in the future._x000D_
    If you would, we would like to leave the record open until _x000D_
the close of business Monday. And if questions come in, _x000D_
hopefully you will answer those fairly promptly."
2923689,2923688,2923690,19197,7,"    With that, without further ado, unless you _x000D_
would like to close with any kind of comments, and I see no _x000D_
nods, the meeting is adjourned. Thank you so much."
2923690,2923689,2923691,19198,1,"    The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will _x000D_
come to order._x000D_
    I want to thank our witness. I know she has significant _x000D_
responsibilities right now at the U.N. Security Council. Ben _x000D_
and I had a chance this week to meet with her and all the _x000D_
members. Quite educational, I hope on both sides. But we _x000D_
certainly appreciate you being here, and I will introduce you _x000D_
in just a moment._x000D_
    Today's hearing will review the United Nations peacekeeping _x000D_
operations and explore opportunities for reform to make U.N. _x000D_
peacekeeping work better in U.S. national interests._x000D_
    As a permanent member of the Security Council and the _x000D_
largest contributor by far to the U.N. peacekeeping budget, the _x000D_
U.S. has a particular interest in how U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
mandates are set and operations are carried out. The United _x000D_
States cannot be everywhere all the time. There is an important _x000D_
role for U.N. peacekeeping in supporting U.S. interests for _x000D_
security and stability around the world._x000D_
    Today's U.N. peacekeeping is evolving in many ways. _x000D_
Traditionally, missions have focused primarily on negotiating _x000D_
peace agreements, inserting blue helmets to separate _x000D_
conflicting parties to implement these agreements, and _x000D_
generally monitoring and keeping the peace._x000D_
    U.N. peacekeepers now are being asked to take on new and _x000D_
difficult responsibilities, such as civilian protection, _x000D_
disarming active combatants, or developing the capacity to _x000D_
engage on the antiterrorism front. These new missions and _x000D_
mandates raise many questions, which we certainly will be _x000D_
exploring today._x000D_
    What are the risks when U.N. peacekeepers actively engage _x000D_
combatants in a warzone? Do U.N. peacekeepers forgo their _x000D_
neutrality in these instances? And if so, what are the _x000D_
implications for our interests?_x000D_
    If U.N. peacekeepers are asked to provide logistics support _x000D_
in humanitarian crises such as the Ebola fight in West Africa, _x000D_
what challenges does that raise?_x000D_
    I am particularly concerned with recent disturbing reports _x000D_
of sexual exploitation and abuse by certain U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
troops. The current U.N. policy is zero tolerance, but such _x000D_
abuses continue with disturbing regularity._x000D_
    So it is our hope to find some common sense ways to address _x000D_
these issues and explore these and other topics, such as the _x000D_
U.S. peacekeeping assessment._x000D_
    We again want to thank our distinguished witness for being _x000D_
here, and I will turn it over to our ranking member for his _x000D_
comments."
2923691,2923690,2923692,19198,1,"    Well, thank you, Chairman Corker. I very _x000D_
much appreciate you convening this hearing on an important _x000D_
topic, and I want to thank all of our distinguished panelists _x000D_
today, extraordinary individuals who have given so much to our _x000D_
country. We thank you all for your participation and your _x000D_
continued service to our country, particularly Ambassador _x000D_
Powers._x000D_
    It is good to see you here._x000D_
    I have long believed the United Nations at its best can be _x000D_
a powerful partner of the United States, advancing global peace _x000D_
and security for far less cost and more effectively than if we _x000D_
act alone. When you add the U.N. presence, it is a global _x000D_
presence, and that is far preferable than having a U.S. or _x000D_
sole, one-country presence._x000D_
    The U.N. does many things right. They assist more than 60 _x000D_
million refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict, famine, _x000D_
and persecution with lifesaving assistance. It provides food to _x000D_
90 million people in 80 countries. It vaccinates 58 percent of _x000D_
the world's children, saving no less than 3 million lives._x000D_
    Recently, it launched the sustainable development goals, _x000D_
which it fully embraced. It could have a powerful impact _x000D_
globally on reducing corruption and poor governance._x000D_
    In short, the U.N. is capable of and has already done a _x000D_
great deal of good in the world. But I believe that the U.N. _x000D_
could be stronger and much more effective, if there were _x000D_
greater transparency and accountability across the entire _x000D_
organization._x000D_
    The U.N.'s continuing anti-Israel bias is deeply unhelpful _x000D_
to our shared interests in a peaceful, stable Middle East._x000D_
    In the case of Syria, the Assad regime continues its _x000D_
indiscriminate barrel-bombing and slaughter of civilians. And _x000D_
those responsible for war crimes have yet to be held _x000D_
accountable._x000D_
    But let us be clear. The United States could not ensure _x000D_
international security alone nor should it have to. The United _x000D_
Nations and specifically the U.N. peacekeeping remains one of _x000D_
the best burden-sharing tools we have to help end war, protect _x000D_
civilian population, and secure territory._x000D_
    By drawing upon the financial and human capacities of all _x000D_
U.N. member states, the U.N. peacekeeping helps the United _x000D_
States share the responsibility of promoting global stability _x000D_
and reduces the need for unilateral intervention._x000D_
    United Nations peacekeeping has managed to protect hundreds _x000D_
of thousands of innocent civilians. With more than 120,000 _x000D_
military and police personnel currently serving as part of 16 _x000D_
missions on four continents, U.N. peacekeepers now represent _x000D_
the largest deployed military force in the world._x000D_
    There are more U.N. peacekeeping missions today because _x000D_
peacekeepers are being asked to do more in increasingly _x000D_
dangerous, remote, and deadly operational environments. We need _x000D_
to recognize this and make sure that the United Nations and the _x000D_
troop-contributing countries are given peacekeepers who are _x000D_
placed in harm's way the protective equipment, training, and _x000D_
support that they deserve._x000D_
    Peacekeepers themselves are often seen as legitimate _x000D_
targets for attack by extremist groups and others. We saw that _x000D_
recently in the horrific attacks in Mali, where terrorists _x000D_
linked to al Qaeda killed 20 people, including an American from _x000D_
Maryland. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali has suffered 42 _x000D_
fatalities at the hands of the militants since January 2013._x000D_
    We know that the U.N. peacekeeping is a cost-effective tool _x000D_
when compared to other military options. The U.N. annual _x000D_
peacekeeping budget only makes up about 0.5 percent of the _x000D_
world's total military expenditures._x000D_
    I think this is a particularly important moment, _x000D_
considering that we are debating the omnibus and dealing with _x000D_
the fiscal issues of our country and trying balance our _x000D_
budgets, so let me bring it closer to home. The U.N. mission, _x000D_
the cost per peacekeeper per year, is about $16,000. In 2014, _x000D_
each U.S. soldier in Afghanistan cost $2.1 million. Moreover, _x000D_
according to the study by the GAO, U.N. peacekeeping operations _x000D_
are eight times less expensive than funding a comparable U.S. _x000D_
force._x000D_
    This is not to say the U.S. share of peacekeeping dues _x000D_
should continue unchanged. I think the chairman has raised a _x000D_
good point about reform in the United Nations in the way they _x000D_
do their budget. The scaled assessment should be reworked, and _x000D_
I am confident that Ambassador Power and the U.N. team are _x000D_
focused on that goal as well._x000D_
    Maintaining the legitimacy of the U.N. peacekeeping is _x000D_
essential. Nothing will erode it faster than the horrific _x000D_
reports that we received on sexual abuse by peacekeepers in _x000D_
certain missions._x000D_
    I have long been concerned about these disturbing reports _x000D_
of sexual exploitation and abuse. As the largest contributor to _x000D_
the United Nations and as the permanent member on the U.N. _x000D_
Security Council, the United States has a responsibility to _x000D_
ensure that the United Nations uphold the highest standards of _x000D_
professionalism in peacekeeping operations. The failure by the _x000D_
United Nations to hold individual peacekeepers, their _x000D_
commanders, and troop-contributing countries accountable for _x000D_
verifiable allegations of abuse is unacceptable._x000D_
    U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon recently announced a _x000D_
series of proposals to combat sexual exploitation and abuse in _x000D_
peacekeeping at a meeting of the representatives from over 100 _x000D_
troop-contributing countries. That is only a start. More must _x000D_
be done by both the United Nations and the member states. And I _x000D_
look forward to hearing about how the United States can _x000D_
continue to push for these effective reforms._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and having a _x000D_
robust discussion."
2923692,2923691,2923693,19198,1,"    Thank you, Senator Cardin._x000D_
    We have two distinguished panels today, and we want to _x000D_
thank all who are here to share their wisdom._x000D_
    Our first witness is the Permanent Representative to the _x000D_
U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Samantha Power. We thank _x000D_
you for being here today with a very tight schedule._x000D_
    We also thank you for bringing Haley back, who served so _x000D_
well with Senator Coons here and was one of the bright people _x000D_
we had here on the committee amongst many._x000D_
    But we thank you both for being here. If you could keep _x000D_
your comments to about 5 minutes or so, we would appreciate it, _x000D_
and then we look forward to Q&A. Thank you._x000D_

   STATEMENT OF HON. SAMANTHA POWER, UNITED STATES PERMANENT _x000D_
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS, UNITED STATES MISSION TO _x000D_
             THE UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK, NEW YORK_x000D_
_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking _x000D_
Member Cardin, for convening this hearing. And thank you all, _x000D_
distinguished members of the committee, for making time to be _x000D_
here to discuss peacekeeping._x000D_
    This committee is acutely aware of the extent to which _x000D_
conflicts on the other side of the globe can come back and _x000D_
threaten American security. We have seen time and again how _x000D_
conflicts can displace millions of people, upend markets, and _x000D_
destabilize entire regions._x000D_
    All too recently and all too frequently, we have seen how _x000D_
such instability can attract and enable violent extremist _x000D_
groups, who exploit the vacuum of authority to terrorize _x000D_
civilians; recruit new members; and plan, launch, or inspire _x000D_
attacks._x000D_
    U.N. peacekeepers play a vital role in the international _x000D_
community's efforts to address war, violence, and instability. _x000D_
As President Obama said in September, ``We know that peace _x000D_
operations are not the solution to every problem, but they do _x000D_
remain one of the world's most important tools to address armed _x000D_
conflict.''_x000D_
    Peacekeepers can help resolve conflict, shore up stability, _x000D_
deny safe harbor to extremists, and protect civilians from _x000D_
atrocities, all of which serve core American interests and _x000D_
reflect deep American values, while ensuring greater burden-_x000D_
sharing by the international community._x000D_
    This administration has consequently been working _x000D_
aggressively to ensure that U.N. peacekeeping operations are _x000D_
better able to meet the demands of international peace and _x000D_
security, which, as has been noted by both the chairman and the _x000D_
ranking member, those requirements have changed considerably _x000D_
over just the last 20 years._x000D_
    Peacekeepers today are undertaking more missions. The _x000D_
number of uniformed personnel has risen from fewer than 20,000 _x000D_
15 years ago to over 100,000 today._x000D_
    They are assuming greater risk. Two-thirds of peacekeepers _x000D_
are operating in active conflicts, the highest percentage in _x000D_
history._x000D_
    And they are assigned broad and increasingly complex _x000D_
responsibilities, ranging from disarming armed groups to _x000D_
facilitating the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to _x000D_
protecting civilians from those who wish them harm._x000D_
    Today, 98 percent of uniformed personnel in U.N. missions _x000D_
around the world are under orders to protect civilians as part _x000D_
of their mandate. This is not your mother's peacekeeping, your _x000D_
father's peacekeeping, your grandfather's peacekeeping. It has _x000D_
evolved significantly._x000D_
    While peacekeeping has never been more important to _x000D_
American interests, it has also never been more demanding. And _x000D_
that is why, in September, President Obama issued the first _x000D_
presidential memorandum on multilateral peace operations in _x000D_
more than 20 years, directing a wide range of actions to _x000D_
strengthen and modernize U.N. operations, including by building _x000D_
partner capacity, providing U.S. support, and leading reform of _x000D_
U.N. peacekeeping._x000D_
    I just want to briefly, Mr. Chairman, touch on a few key _x000D_
lines of effort that we have pursued. These are described in _x000D_
greater detail in my written submission._x000D_
    First, we are working to ensure that countries with the _x000D_
will to perform 21st century peacekeeping, that they have the _x000D_
capacity to do so. One way we are doing this is through the _x000D_
African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership, or APRRP, _x000D_
which President Obama announced in August 2014._x000D_
    Through APRRP, the United States is investing in the _x000D_
capacity of six African countries that have proven themselves _x000D_
leaders in peacekeeping. In exchange, these countries have _x000D_
committed to maintain the forces and equipment necessary to _x000D_
deploy rapidly._x000D_
    This initiative builds upon the Global Peace Operations _x000D_
Initiative launched under President George W. Bush, which is _x000D_
our primary tool for building partner-nation peacekeeping _x000D_
capacity, and it will help ensure that more soldiers deployed _x000D_
for peacekeeping missions will be fully prepared._x000D_
    I hope that the Senate and House will fully fund this _x000D_
important initiative in future years._x000D_
    Second, we are expanding the pool of troop- and police-_x000D_
contributing countries, and bringing advanced militaries back _x000D_
into peacekeeping. In September, President Obama convened a _x000D_
historic high-level summit, the first of its kind, at the U.N. _x000D_
to rally new commitments to peacekeeping, marking the _x000D_
culmination of a yearlong effort initiated by Vice President _x000D_
Biden at the previous U.N. General Assembly. Forty-nine _x000D_
countries participated and pledged nearly 50,000 additional _x000D_
troops and police._x000D_
    Not only that, more of these troops will now come from _x000D_
advanced militaries, who bring with them equipment and _x000D_
expertise that is critically needed on the ground. We saw this _x000D_
in Mali in January this year, when Dutch attack helicopters _x000D_
helped Bangladeshi infantry repel rebels who had opened fire on _x000D_
their camp, where civilians were taking refuge._x000D_
    The United States is making contributions in this respect _x000D_
as well as one part of our unrivaled contribution to global _x000D_
peace and security, looking specifically for ways to leverage _x000D_
our military's unique capabilities to support peacekeeping _x000D_
operations, including by enabling faster deployment by others._x000D_
    Third, we are working to ensure a higher standard of _x000D_
performance and conduct once peacekeeping contingents are _x000D_
deployed, specifically in two critical areas: the complete _x000D_
fulfillment of their mandates and the combating of sexual _x000D_
exploitation and abuse._x000D_
    The additional troops generated by the President's _x000D_
September summit will prove invaluable to both goals, by _x000D_
allowing the U.N. to be more selective as to which troops it _x000D_
deploys, and now giving it the leverage to repatriate poorly _x000D_
performing troops and police when necessary, and especially, of _x000D_
course, in instances where there are credible allegations of _x000D_
sexual abuse._x000D_
    With respect to mandate, when peacekeepers deploy in _x000D_
volatile situations, they have to be prepared to use force to _x000D_
defend themselves, to protect civilians, and to otherwise carry _x000D_
out their mandated tasks._x000D_
    Too often in the past, peacekeepers have shied away, even _x000D_
when atrocities are being perpetrated. A report by the U.N.'s _x000D_
internal oversight office in March last year found that in 507 _x000D_
attacks against civilians from 2010 to 2013, peacekeepers _x000D_
virtually never used force to protect those coming under _x000D_
attack. Thousands of civilians likely lost their lives as a _x000D_
result. This cannot continue, and a growing number of leading _x000D_
troop contributors agree. The 50,000 additional troops and _x000D_
police should enable more capable, more willing troops and _x000D_
police to staff these missions._x000D_
    The same is true on sexual exploitation and violence. And _x000D_
let me just state the obvious here. We share the outrage of _x000D_
everyone on this committee, all the American people who are _x000D_
focused on this issue. Peacekeepers must not abuse civilians. _x000D_
Sexual abuse and exploitation have no place, it goes without _x000D_
saying, again, in any society. It is especially abhorrent when _x000D_
committed by those who take advantage of the trust that _x000D_
communities are placing in the United Nations, and those _x000D_
responsible must be held accountable._x000D_
    Addressing this scourge will require continuing the _x000D_
important efforts begun by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to _x000D_
strengthen the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy, _x000D_
including bolstering reporting and accountability measures, and _x000D_
pledging to set up an immediate response team to investigate _x000D_
certain cases. It will also require more vigilance and follow-_x000D_
through from troop-contributing countries._x000D_
    There must also be far more transparency in these _x000D_
investigations, to track cases and ensure that justice is _x000D_
served._x000D_
    The U.N. should be able to take advantage now of its newly _x000D_
expanded pool of soldiers and police by suspending from _x000D_
peacekeeping any country that does not take seriously the _x000D_
responsibility to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute _x000D_
credible allegations._x000D_
    The fourth and final priority, Mr. Chairman, is to press _x000D_
for bold institutional reforms within the U.N. itself. We have _x000D_
seen the U.N. secretariat make profound changes to _x000D_
peacekeeping, from improved logistics and sustainment to a more _x000D_
comprehensive approach to crisis situations that integrates _x000D_
military, police, and civilian tools. But much, much more needs _x000D_
to be done, and we have spearheaded efforts to enact further _x000D_
reforms, including longer troop rotations to preserve _x000D_
institutional memory, penalties for troops who show up without _x000D_
the necessary equipment to perform their duties._x000D_
    And we will continue to work aggressively to cut costs. The _x000D_
U.N. has already, thanks to U.S. leadership, cut the per-_x000D_
peacekeeper costs by roughly 17 percent since 2008. We are also _x000D_
working to advance the reforms proposed by the Secretary _x000D_
General's High-Level Independent Panel on U.N. Peace _x000D_
Operations, which are intended to address inadequate planning, _x000D_
slow troop deployment, uneven mission leadership, breakdowns in _x000D_
command-and-control, and a current set of rules around human _x000D_
resources and procurement designed for the conference rooms of _x000D_
New York and not the streets of Bangui._x000D_
    Let me conclude. In all of the areas I have just described, _x000D_
we have seen improvements, and the United States has played an _x000D_
instrumental role in making them possible. But there is much _x000D_
more to be done._x000D_
    We are not satisfied with peacekeepers fulfilling only _x000D_
parts, but not all, of their mandates; with peacekeepers _x000D_
standing up to protect civilians in some, but not all, _x000D_
situations; or with soldiers being held accountable for crimes _x000D_
or misconduct some, but not all, of the time._x000D_
    The role played by peacekeepers today is too important. For _x000D_
the sake of our own interests and security, as well as the _x000D_
millions of innocent people around the world whose lives may _x000D_
depend on peacekeepers, we will continue working to strengthen _x000D_
peacekeeping so that it is tailored for the 21st century _x000D_
threats peacekeepers face._x000D_
    We appreciate your interest and support and continued _x000D_
dialogue on these matters. Thank you."
2923693,2923692,2923694,19198,2,"    Well, thank you very much for those comments._x000D_
    Senator Isakson and I were in Darfur years ago and just _x000D_
infuriated by the caveats that the U.N. peacekeepers had. They _x000D_
could only fire at people when they were fired upon. You had _x000D_
women going out and collecting wood from their villages being _x000D_
raped, abused, people being murdered by the Janjaweed. Yet _x000D_
those caveats remained._x000D_
    So we have evolved, as you mentioned. This is not our _x000D_
father's peacekeeping mission anymore._x000D_
    As we have evolved these missions, though, and people now _x000D_
are placing themselves as peacekeepers more in the center of _x000D_
conflicts, in some cases taking sides, how has this changed the _x000D_
way the U.N. is viewed in these peacekeeping missions? I assume _x000D_
you believe this is in our national interests for us to be in _x000D_
these missions certainly, I do. But how has this changed the _x000D_
way these blue hats are viewed in these areas?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator Corker. It is an _x000D_
excellent question._x000D_
    I think one of the lines that the U.N. struggles to walk is _x000D_
that it has, on the one hand, peacekeepers that are charged _x000D_
with an aggressive enforcement of mandates, which entail _x000D_
protecting civilians, not just protecting peacekeepers _x000D_
themselves, as was once the case. You have that on one hand. _x000D_
Then you have U.N. country programs that often look _x000D_
indistinguishable. They are all driving around in white _x000D_
vehicles, unarmed, passing out food, providing shelter, trying _x000D_
to provide counseling to those who have been victimized by _x000D_
sexual abuse._x000D_
    So it has been challenging, the blurring of functions _x000D_
across these missions. But the only thing worse than _x000D_
confronting that challenge of having people in society _x000D_
distinguish who does what, is actually people in these _x000D_
societies rely on peacekeepers, know that the mandate says _x000D_
protect civilians, and have those peacekeepers bunkered and _x000D_
more interested, again, in collecting a paycheck and then going _x000D_
home than actually being out and about and delivering on the _x000D_
promise of that blue flag._x000D_
    So, again, it varies per conflict area. I think we have _x000D_
come a long way. But as I noted, the statistics are not _x000D_
inspiring. I mean, there are still many troop-contributing _x000D_
countries who send their troops in without the very strict _x000D_
guidance that you will be sent home if you do not enforce the _x000D_
mandate you are given."
2923694,2923693,2923695,19198,2,"    Yes. I appreciate the comment Senator Cardin _x000D_
made about the cost. But, as I understand it, for some of these _x000D_
countries, even though the cost to us is far less than having _x000D_
U.S. soldiers there, the pay for these soldiers is far greater _x000D_
than they would otherwise receive in their own countries. And, _x000D_
actually, if I understand correctly, that money goes to the _x000D_
national governments of those countries. And so these countries _x000D_
are benefiting financially in sending troops there._x000D_
    Is that correct, in some cases, in some of the lower income _x000D_
countries? And is that feeding this situation of actually _x000D_
having troops there that are not, if you will, carrying out _x000D_
their mandates in an appropriate way, with soldiers not _x000D_
qualified or trained and not properly equipped? Talk to us a _x000D_
little bit about what is driving having folks within the _x000D_
peacekeeping missions that are that are certainly not _x000D_
conducting themselves in a professional manner._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, again. It _x000D_
reflects a real understanding of the dynamics in some of these _x000D_
missions._x000D_
    Again, the performance is uneven. The motivation is uneven. _x000D_
The incentive for troops is uneven. If you take, for instance, _x000D_
Rwandan peacekeepers, who do get a more substantial stipend by _x000D_
serving in peacekeeping missions than they might if they were _x000D_
at home, but they are totally driven by what happened in their _x000D_
country 21 years ago and actually view protecting civilians as _x000D_
a way of showing the world what should have been done when the _x000D_
genocide unfolded in Rwanda._x000D_
    Contrast that with other troops, again, who institutionally _x000D_
are not given the guidance from capital that they need to be _x000D_
out and about, that, yes, there are risks entailed with _x000D_
patrolling, but there are risks also that are entailed by being _x000D_
bunkered._x000D_
    I think on the question, the very specific question of the _x000D_
stipend, as Senator Cardin said, this is a very good deal for _x000D_
the American taxpayer. These are extremely difficult _x000D_
environments, not only because of the risks of militia and _x000D_
government forces targeting peacekeepers as they are out and _x000D_
about, but also just the conditions in terms of logistics, _x000D_
access to water. I mean, these are missions that are not _x000D_
expending resources in the manner that our missions do when _x000D_
they deploy internationally. The logistic tail is not nearly as _x000D_
fulsome._x000D_
    So I think it is important to incentivize their _x000D_
participation. Some countries are doing it because they are _x000D_
able, again, to secure additional resources that they are _x000D_
investing in ways that sometimes we do not have full visibility _x000D_
into, sometimes in professionalizing their militaries, _x000D_
sometimes in other parts of their government._x000D_
    But I think Senator Cardin's point is very, very important. _x000D_
We are getting a lot out of the 100,000-plus troops who are _x000D_
active in these conflict areas. These are places where, in some _x000D_
instances, if you look at Mali or Lebanon, places that are _x000D_
really cutting-edge theaters in terms of terrorism and _x000D_
extremism, and if it weren't for U.N. peacekeepers who were _x000D_
there putting their lives at risk, it may come to the United _x000D_
States at some point in order for us to advance our security."
2923695,2923694,2923696,19198,2,"    As it relates to the issues of the abuse that _x000D_
has taken place that is, obviously, abhorrent, in fairness, I _x000D_
think people on both sides of the aisle have concerns about the _x000D_
U.N.'s ability to actually put reforms in place. And we _x000D_
understand how the U.N. operates, and I know you talked about _x000D_
the leader's desire to create reforms. We sent a letter _x000D_
suggesting that we have onsite court marshals by the countries _x000D_
to handle peacekeeping soldiers accused of crimes be tried, by _x000D_
the way, under their own country military preocedures to reduce _x000D_
impunity. We also made some other suggestions._x000D_
    What is your sense that those types of reforms can be _x000D_
implemented, relative to peacekeeping?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, as Ambassador Negroponte behind me _x000D_
I think will attest, through the life of the U.N. you have a _x000D_
challenge, always, on reform, in the sense that there are two _x000D_
places you have to secure--will and follow-through._x000D_
    The first is with the countries that comprise the U.N. So _x000D_
every troop-contributing country to peacekeeping has to be _x000D_
prepared to look at the kinds of ideas that you put in your _x000D_
letter that we have been pushing in new York and implement in _x000D_
their own military changes to ensure follow-though, oversight _x000D_
in the first instance, follow-through on investigation, and _x000D_
accountability, whether a court martial or some kind of _x000D_
prosecution in civilian court._x000D_
    And again, there is probably no one-size-fits-all solution, _x000D_
because every country has its own set of procedures, again, for _x000D_
following up on abuse of any kind._x000D_
    Then there is the U.N. itself, which has to be much _x000D_
aggressive in shining a spotlight on those countries that are _x000D_
not taking the steps that are needed._x000D_
    I think that we have seen improvements. This is, again, not _x000D_
something one should cite as an improvement. It should never _x000D_
have been the case that it was otherwise. But those individuals _x000D_
who were alleged to be involved in sexual abuse now are not _x000D_
being paid by the U.N. They are being recalled to their _x000D_
capital. Training and vetting now is changing, so that there is _x000D_
training on preventing sexual abuse and exploitation._x000D_
    You had an idea, I believe, in your letter about a claims _x000D_
kind of commission. I think the U.N. is looking at creating a _x000D_
victim support trust fund, which is something, of course, we _x000D_
would wish to support as well. It is going to require going _x000D_
back to member states and getting resources to put into that, _x000D_
but maybe some of the docked pay of those against whom there _x000D_
are allegations could be used in service of such a fund. And _x000D_
then I think having more aggressive onsite investigative _x000D_
capacity, so that less time passes between an allegation and an _x000D_
actual follow-through._x000D_
    Lastly, the two aspects of reform come together. In order _x000D_
to secure meaningful reform that actually matters for potential _x000D_
victims or people who have already been victimized, there has _x000D_
to be more transparency between what is actually going on in _x000D_
the field and then what we are made aware of in New York._x000D_
    Too often, we hear from NGOs or from journalists about _x000D_
sexual abuse and exploitation, rather than from the U.N. _x000D_
itself. And if we are to go to a developing country and try to _x000D_
enhance their capacity, their training on the front end, their _x000D_
capacity to investigate on the backend of an allegation, we _x000D_
have to know who has been accused of doing what at what period, _x000D_
and be in a position to offer support._x000D_
    If there are countries who are shirking their obligation to _x000D_
carry out investigations, we have to know so that we can look _x000D_
at our bilateral leverage and whether we might suspend some _x000D_
forms of assistance, if, in fact, there is a recurrent pattern _x000D_
of not actually taking seriously the zero-tolerance policy."
2923696,2923695,2923697,19198,2,"    Well, thank you. My time is up. And as a _x000D_
courtesy, I want to move on._x000D_
    I do hope through questioning at some point and--I know the _x000D_
President has made additional pledges to the U.N. beyond our _x000D_
normal peacekeeping budgeting. I hope at some point it will _x000D_
come to light as to where those resources are planned to come _x000D_
from. But thank you again for being here._x000D_
    Senator Cardin?"
2923697,2923696,2923698,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you, Ambassador Power, for your service to our _x000D_
country._x000D_
    As I said in my opening statement, I am a strong supporter _x000D_
of the mission of the United Nations and the incredible _x000D_
progress it has made in global issues. I want to talk about _x000D_
transparency and accountability. It has come up quite a bit on _x000D_
several subjects._x000D_
    One of the, I think, clearest ways to try to help the _x000D_
safety of civilians is to hold President Assad of Syria _x000D_
accountable for violating international war-crime-type _x000D_
activities. So do we have your commitment, as our Ambassador in _x000D_
the United Nations, that we will seek full accountability by _x000D_
President Assad for the war crimes that he has committed in any _x000D_
of these negotiations that take place in regard to the _x000D_
resolution of Syria?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Well, let me say that one of my more unsuccessful days in _x000D_
my office, since this body was good enough to confirm me for my _x000D_
job, was pursuing a referral of the war crimes and crimes _x000D_
against humanity carried out in Syria to the International _x000D_
Criminal Court. That was a resolution we brought to the U.N. _x000D_
Security Council. Notwithstanding our own nonparticipation in _x000D_
the ICC, we believe that is a venue that should be looking at _x000D_
chemical weapons attacks and barrel-bomb attacks and systematic _x000D_
torture. And, of course, that effort at a referral was vetoed _x000D_
by Russia, a veto supported by China."
2923698,2923697,2923699,19198,2,"    I do understand there are going to be _x000D_
negotiations that will involve the United States. And the _x000D_
United States is going to have to sign off on those _x000D_
negotiations. Do I have your commitment that your position at _x000D_
the United Nations will be to hold President Assad accountable _x000D_
for the type of activities you just described?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. The ultimate settlement in Syria is _x000D_
going to be between the opposition and the Syrian Government. _x000D_
The United States position on accountability I hope is well-_x000D_
known. We are absolutely supportive and have been aggressively _x000D_
supportive in building an evidentiary base so as to ensure that _x000D_
Assad and other people responsible for war crimes are held _x000D_
accountable."
2923699,2923698,2923700,19198,2,"    It is not up to the government and _x000D_
opposition to determine whether a person has violated _x000D_
international standards on conduct of war. War crimes are _x000D_
global. It is global accountability._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I think there are two separate issues. _x000D_
One is what is the standard or the threshold question for where _x000D_
accountability should be provided or whether prosecution or a _x000D_
truth commission, the whole set of tactical question about how _x000D_
accountability should be pursued._x000D_
    There is a related, overlapping question of what the terms _x000D_
of a political settlement would be. I mean, this is not _x000D_
something that is on the verge of happening, so I think the _x000D_
details on accountability have not yet been fleshed out, and it _x000D_
is something we should consult on._x000D_
    But I want to underscore that the final agreement has to be _x000D_
something that both the opposition and the government can get _x000D_
behind."
2923700,2923699,2923701,19198,2,"    I understand that. It does not quite answer _x000D_
my question._x000D_
    Let me make my position clear, and I think the members of _x000D_
this committee. If President Assad is not held accountable, _x000D_
there will not be support for any solution in regard to Syria. _x000D_
I will just make that pretty clear from the beginning._x000D_
    Let me talk to issue number two on transparency and _x000D_
accountability. The chairman has already talked about that, the _x000D_
abuse allegations. If this is not done in an open manner, where _x000D_
there is complete understanding and disclosure of what is _x000D_
taking place, the confidence factor of those responsible for _x000D_
these abuses being held accountable will not be there._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I agree completely. I mean, I am not _x000D_
sure what to add._x000D_
    As I said, there has been insufficient reporting back to _x000D_
the Security Council. We have now taken sexual abuse and _x000D_
exploitation and made it an issue to be discussed in the _x000D_
Security Council. The Secretary General has now committed to _x000D_
reporting back."
2923701,2923700,2923702,19198,2,"    And I have seen the specific _x000D_
recommendations, and they are good. But you have to follow _x000D_
through on it, and it has to be done in a way that the _x000D_
international community, the activists, those who are following _x000D_
this, can be confident that those who are responsible have _x000D_
truly been held accountable, so that this will not happen in _x000D_
the future, will not be tolerated in the future. You said zero _x000D_
tolerance, which we agree._x000D_
    That is, I think, the important point, that it is not just _x000D_
a closed investigation, but that we have an open closure of _x000D_
this issue and a commitment on how to go forward on how these _x000D_
matters will be handled._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I think right now, Senator, it is very _x000D_
fair to say that victims who come forward do so at their own _x000D_
peril, and do not do so with confidence that having taken that _x000D_
risk, having potentially ostracized themselves in their own _x000D_
communities, that there is even going to be accountability on _x000D_
the backend. That has to change entirely. I suspect if it does _x000D_
change, you may well see more people coming forward."
2923702,2923701,2923703,19198,2,"    So let me get to my third point on _x000D_
transparency and accountability, and that is the budget system _x000D_
at the United Nations. It is anything but open and clear and _x000D_
transparent. That is nothing new. It has been that way for a _x000D_
long time._x000D_
    It is hard for me to understand why our assessment on the _x000D_
peacekeeping is 28.36 percent, if I am correct, which is almost _x000D_
three times higher than the next country and is significantly _x000D_
higher than our general allocation for the U.N. budget._x000D_
    That does not seem to me to be a transparent way to budget. _x000D_
So can you just briefly inform us as to the U.S. position in _x000D_
regard to a fair allocation of the U.N. budget in an open and _x000D_
transparent manner?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    The formula on the U.S. share of the peacekeeping budget is _x000D_
a very complex formula. Let me say in brief that it is some _x000D_
combination of our share of the global economy plus a premium _x000D_
that we pay by being a permanent member of the Security Council _x000D_
and, particularly with the veto, getting to dictate whether a _x000D_
mission comes into existence or whether it does not, along with _x000D_
the other permanent members as a whole, along with the rest of _x000D_
the Security Council. So we pay a premium for being a permanent _x000D_
member._x000D_
    We were able to secure the cap on our regular budget. The _x000D_
formula would actually have us pay at a higher rate if not for _x000D_
the 22 percent cap that Ambassador Holbrooke secured now going _x000D_
on 15 years ago._x000D_
    The one thing I want to stress is that our emphasis is on _x000D_
ensuring that countries that are contributing more and more to _x000D_
the global economy are paying more of their share. We are in _x000D_
the midst of scales negotiations now on our share of the _x000D_
peacekeeping budget. Our emphasis, again, has been on ensuring _x000D_
countries, you can see their economic growth, but you do not _x000D_
see a correlation in terms of their contribution._x000D_
    The Chinese contribution to peacekeeping has more than _x000D_
doubled in the last 10 years. And I think we can anticipate _x000D_
that the Chinese share is going to be up around 10 percent, _x000D_
which would be a tripling of its share. Similarly, the Russian _x000D_
contribution has doubled. Again, China and Russia being two of _x000D_
the five permanent members on the council."
2923703,2923702,2923704,19198,2,"    Well, we should point out that China is _x000D_
still about one-fourth of the United States, less than one-_x000D_
fourth. And Russia is about one-eighth of the United States._x000D_
    It just seems to us that that 22 percent cap, we understand _x000D_
that and that was well-deserved, the way that came out. It _x000D_
looks like the United Nations is equalizing through the _x000D_
peacekeeping percentage and that the 22 percent cap is being _x000D_
violated because of our higher contributions to the _x000D_
peacekeeping efforts._x000D_
    I just urge you that the more transparent this process, the _x000D_
better it is going to be, I think, received politically in our _x000D_
country. And we do think the 22 percent is a fair number. We _x000D_
think it should be honored and be honored in the peacekeeping._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I just want to underscore that when the _x000D_
agreement was secured on the 22 percent cap, no similar _x000D_
agreement was secured as it related to peacekeeping. In fact, _x000D_
having the 22 percent cap actually helps us in the peacekeeping _x000D_
realm because 22 percent becomes the baseline on which these _x000D_
premiums are agreed to._x000D_
    I want to stress, we share the same objective. We want to _x000D_
get other countries to step up and pay their share. We still _x000D_
believe that if you look, again, at what this means for U.S. _x000D_
national security--I think this is, again, a version of the _x000D_
argument you made at the beginning--that even when you compare _x000D_
it to NATO, where the United States bears the lion's share of _x000D_
defense investments, that having the rest of the world paying _x000D_
72 percent of the peacekeeping budget is a good deal for the _x000D_
American taxpayer."
2923704,2923703,2923705,19198,2,"    And my last point and I hope this will be _x000D_
covered, as the chairman said, by others, the safety of _x000D_
civilians is critically important. You stressed the increased _x000D_
number commitment made in the meeting in September._x000D_
    It seems to me it is not a matter of numbers of personnel. _x000D_
Do they have the will to go in and stand in front of civilians _x000D_
to protect them? We have not seen that._x000D_
    So I am not sure I was comforted by your reply that we have _x000D_
greater capacity by number. If we do not have greater capacity _x000D_
by will, the civilian population is going to be at great risk._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. If I may, Senator, just respond briefly._x000D_
    The point that I emphasized in my testimony was that we _x000D_
have succeeded now in getting contributions, or commitments, I _x000D_
should say, not yet contributions, from advanced militaries._x000D_
    Europe had gotten out of peacekeeping, by and large, over _x000D_
the course of the last 20 years, and we think it is really _x000D_
important that they get back in. There is no necessary _x000D_
correlation always between being an advanced military and _x000D_
having the political will to put yourself in harm's way to _x000D_
protect civilians._x000D_
    But we think that, again, giving the U.N. the choice--now _x000D_
it has a pool from which it can choose. And if there are people _x000D_
who show insufficient will and want to spend more time in their _x000D_
bases than out and about protecting civilians, we think having _x000D_
this pool of forces, which include, again, more professional _x000D_
and advanced militaries and better aviation and engineering and _x000D_
infantry capabilities, giving the U.N. that selectivity is _x000D_
going to mean over time that the performance of these _x000D_
peacekeepers is going to improve._x000D_
    So numbers alone do not mean anything, if you have 50,000 _x000D_
commitments of people who do not have political will. But we _x000D_
see in that pool, actually, substantial commitments from those _x000D_
we think do have that will."
2923705,2923704,2923706,19198,2,"    Before turning to Senator Perdue, I just want _x000D_
to thank the ranking member for bringing up an issue that is _x000D_
brought up consistently, certainly, on our side of the aisle. I _x000D_
want to thank him for that._x000D_
    I do want to just emphasize that with NATO, which I know is _x000D_
not in your jurisdiction, we have become the provider of _x000D_
security services. Our NATO allies, generally speaking, are the _x000D_
consumer of security services._x000D_
    And the same thing is happening with peacekeeping at the _x000D_
U.N. I know it is a different set of actors._x000D_
    But the very people that stymie our efforts to pursue our _x000D_
interests--China, for instance--are taking advantage of us with _x000D_
respect to sharing the peacekeeping costs. So yes, it is in our _x000D_
U.S. national interests that we have peacekeeping missions and _x000D_
that we have stability and security around the world. But I _x000D_
think we continue to be not as good as we should be at forcing _x000D_
other nations to also be responsible._x000D_
    So I want to thank Senator Cardin for bringing this _x000D_
important issue up. It is infuriating--infuriating--to have the _x000D_
lack of transparency that exists at the U.N. I think, over _x000D_
time, it will erode support. Such support is already not _x000D_
particularly high because of the many issues we see going _x000D_
unattended, like not dealing with the ballistic missiles that _x000D_
are being fired by Iran in violation of UNSCR 1929._x000D_
    So I would just say, I am glad there is bipartisan concern. _x000D_
I hope that you can address it._x000D_
    With that, Senator Perdue."
2923706,2923705,2923707,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Let me also echo that. I want to compliment the ranking _x000D_
member for continuing to bring this up. I wanted to talk about _x000D_
that just in a second._x000D_
    Right now, we are spending about $2 billion just in the _x000D_
peacekeeping force for the United States. I think that is our _x000D_
contribution. Because of the assessment disagreement, we are _x000D_
some $345 million in arrears, I think, in terms of what the _x000D_
U.N. says we owe them._x000D_
    I would like to point out also, Mr. Chairman, that it is _x000D_
not just the percentages here in relation to the size of the _x000D_
GDP. Also, I think, it should be taken into account the _x000D_
percentage of GDPs in these countries that are spent on their _x000D_
own military. That also bears to the global security situation._x000D_
    So I think given the situation we have the in the U.S., _x000D_
Madam Ambassador, in the last few years, 35 percent to 40 _x000D_
percent of what we have been spending is borrowed, I think this _x000D_
is a very timely time to have that really serious conversation _x000D_
in the U.N. I applaud you guys for doing that._x000D_
    I have two quick questions._x000D_
    First, I want to thank you for what you are doing. Given _x000D_
your high school years in Georgia, we claim you and we are _x000D_
proud of what you are doing._x000D_
    So I want to talk about Hezbollah, and I want to talk about _x000D_
Lebanon in just a minute._x000D_
    You know, in 1978, UNIFIL was created there as the interim _x000D_
force in Lebanon. Some 12,000 troops are there from the U.N. _x000D_
Resolution 1701 in 2006 strengthened the mandate there to _x000D_
monitor and to preclude the illegal transport of weapons into _x000D_
Lebanon. And yet we know today they have an estimated 120,000, _x000D_
150,000 rockets, some of these very sophisticated guided _x000D_
weapons. It is very troubling._x000D_
    So it looks to me like, if that mandate was directed to _x000D_
keep weapons out of Lebanon, they are failing against that _x000D_
mandate._x000D_
    Can you talk a little bit about their current role there? _x000D_
And what is their role against 1701? And then we have had _x000D_
reports that there have been threats around reprisals if they _x000D_
report violations and so forth. What can we do to strengthen _x000D_
UNIFIL there and to preclude Lebanon from the illegal transport _x000D_
of these dangerous weapons?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you._x000D_
    UNIFIL has, I think, played an ameliorative role since 2006 _x000D_
in calming the situation, but there is no question that _x000D_
Hezbollah has been able to maintain and expand an arsenal. And _x000D_
we have and continue to urge UNIFIL to be more aggressive in _x000D_
patrolling, in monitoring, in speaking out about violations of _x000D_
the UNIFIL mandate._x000D_
    And I think that what you have seen, actually, in recent _x000D_
months is at least more transparency on the part of UNIFIL. I _x000D_
mean, part of the challenge here is, as we know from _x000D_
confronting terrorist organizations in other parts of the _x000D_
world, when you are not at war with those terrorist _x000D_
organizations, you are using political pressure, particularly _x000D_
by Lebanon's own sovereign institutions, which are themselves _x000D_
very weak, as we know from the current paralysis in Lebanon. _x000D_
You are shining a spotlight. You are trying to ensure _x000D_
interdiction of weapons before they even get into the theater _x000D_
in question._x000D_
    So UNIFIL is not a perfect fix for everything that ails _x000D_
Lebanon or for the threat posed by Hezbollah. But it has a _x000D_
responsibility to be vocal and to take very seriously its _x000D_
reporting mandate, also so countries in the region, including _x000D_
our friends, know what is happening in an area from which _x000D_
threats have come routinely in recent decades."
2923707,2923706,2923708,19198,2,"    Also, let me just ask you to add a comment _x000D_
or two about Syria. The U.N. Disengagement Observer Force, _x000D_
UNDOF, has actually withdrawn from the Golan on the Syrian _x000D_
side, because of the fighting there. Can you speak to their _x000D_
role now? And how are they interacting with IDF in that?_x000D_
    And I have one last question._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you._x000D_
    I mean, you are right that there has been a _x000D_
reconfiguration. This is something UNDOF has done in close _x000D_
consultation with the Government of Israel. Given the stakes _x000D_
here, it is a response to the fact that al-Nusra made advances _x000D_
on one side of the line. And right now this is----"
2923708,2923707,2923709,19198,2,"    They actually kidnapped some of the U.N. _x000D_
forces._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Exactly, Senator, they did. And the _x000D_
release of those forces had to be negotiated._x000D_
    And I will say, even that incident showed, it is not the _x000D_
same as civilian protection, but an unevenness in how the _x000D_
different units responded, which again is life in the U.N. Some _x000D_
holding onto their weapons, refusing to be cowed. Others _x000D_
handing over their weapons and, unfortunately, in a manner that _x000D_
left UNDOF weaker and where those weapons had to be _x000D_
replenished._x000D_
    But we again view this as a temporary relocation. We still _x000D_
believe the prior configuration is the stabilizing _x000D_
configuration. But I think the Israelis are well-aware as well _x000D_
that the circumstances do not lend themselves to putting the _x000D_
observers on the other side of the line."
2923709,2923708,2923710,19198,2,"    The last question I have with the time _x000D_
remaining, Ambassador, the chairman mentioned it, is on the _x000D_
violations of Iran. We have been concerned since the JCPOA that _x000D_
Iran would violate our agreement incrementally. They are _x000D_
violating the U.N. agreement not incrementally, but in a major _x000D_
way--these are Resolutions 1929 and 2231--with the launch in _x000D_
October. And then we have reports in the last week or so of a _x000D_
second launch._x000D_
    What is the U.N. doing in relation to those violations and _x000D_
the sanctions that back those up?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator. Yes, this is _x000D_
something that I have had occasion to talk to the chairman _x000D_
about. And it is music to a U.N. Ambassador's ears when _x000D_
Resolution 1929, Resolution 2231 just roll off the tongue of _x000D_
Members of Congress._x000D_
    Resolution 1929 has been an incredibly important foundation _x000D_
to the international sanctions regime. The ballistic missile _x000D_
launch from October is a violation of 1929. As soon as we _x000D_
confirmed the launch, we brought it to the Security Council. We _x000D_
now are going to be discussing it on Tuesday. The U.N. _x000D_
machinery always works slowly._x000D_
    The panel of experts is looking at it. We have provided all _x000D_
the information that we have on it._x000D_
    And, in a way, the Security Council is an important venue _x000D_
for increasing the political costs on Iran when they violate _x000D_
Resolution 1929._x000D_
    I would note, of course, that the JCPOA is aimed at _x000D_
dismantling Iran's nuclear weapons program, so that the threat _x000D_
that Iran poses in any aspect of its military is much _x000D_
diminished._x000D_
    The Security Council sanctions body operates by consensus. _x000D_
This is something that over time benefits the United States. _x000D_
But on something like that, it means we have to convince all _x000D_
members of the committee also to support our desired _x000D_
designations or any further form of accountability."
2923710,2923709,2923711,19198,2,"    So what is the U.S. trying to move forward _x000D_
in terms of strengthening the sanctions?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, it is the U.N. machinery. We have _x000D_
to get the report back from the panel of experts. We will _x000D_
discuss it in the committee. And then we will look at what the _x000D_
right tool is._x000D_
    I think it is very important, also, to look at the _x000D_
bilateral tools we have. We maintain sanctions, as you know, _x000D_
and will, even after implementation day, on ballistic missiles, _x000D_
on counterterrorism, on human rights. And I think we many of _x000D_
the individuals involved in their ballistic missile program _x000D_
have already been sanctioned, as you well know, over the years. _x000D_
So trying to secure a nexus between this launch and any _x000D_
particular individual entity is a challenge that we need to _x000D_
take on._x000D_
    But I think looking at the Security Council and our _x000D_
bilateral tools as complementary is very important in this _x000D_
regard."
2923711,2923710,2923712,19198,2,"    Thank you. Thank you again for your _x000D_
service._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator."
2923712,2923711,2923713,19198,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Cardin and I both emphasized with the Security _x000D_
Council 2 days ago that, look, let us face it. The possible _x000D_
military dimensions piece, we thought they might get a D-. They _x000D_
got an F. A total hoax. A total hoax._x000D_
    Non-action here is just going to empower them to continue _x000D_
to violate. And I think what the Ambassador just said is the _x000D_
U.N. is going to do nothing--nothing--because China and Russia _x000D_
will block that from occurring._x000D_
    So I do hope they are preparing their bilateral efforts._x000D_
    It is disappointing that, again, we provide the resources _x000D_
that we do, and yet we have countries that will not cause other _x000D_
countries to live up to their obligations and block that. So it _x000D_
is very disappointing._x000D_
    Senator Coons?"
2923713,2923712,2923714,19198,2,"    Thank you, Chairman Corker and Ranking _x000D_
Member Cardin._x000D_
    And thank you, Ambassador Power, for your tireless and _x000D_
dedicated service, your advocacy for human rights, your _x000D_
leadership in representing us at the United Nations, and your _x000D_
passion for the difficult and demanding mission that you are _x000D_
carrying out on behalf of our Nation._x000D_
    I share the concerns expressed by many colleagues about the _x000D_
active enforcement of the JCPOA and ongoing work to enforce _x000D_
U.N. Security Council resolutions._x000D_
    I was pleased to hear there is an upcoming meeting of _x000D_
finance ministers around the U.N. Security Council and look _x000D_
forward to continuing to work closely with you and Secretary _x000D_
Lew and others in the administration to make sure that we are _x000D_
using all the tools we can to enforce the sanctions that remain _x000D_
in place and to re-impose sanctions, should Iranian behavior _x000D_
demonstrate the necessity of doing so._x000D_
    I have had the opportunity to visit U.N. peacekeepers in _x000D_
the field in a number countries, and have seen both the _x000D_
positive that they can accomplish in countries like Liberia and _x000D_
the DRC, and some of the very real challenges, particularly _x000D_
where, as you noted in your opening testimony, there is a _x000D_
disconnect between the mission to protect civilians and the _x000D_
training equipment, leadership, and inclination or will to do _x000D_
so._x000D_
    So start, if you would, by just focusing on whether there _x000D_
is a mismatch between U.N. Security Council mandates and what _x000D_
troop-contributor countries are really trained and prepared to _x000D_
do._x000D_
    I was very encouraged by the President's leadership in _x000D_
renewing a call to more advanced militaries to deliver not just _x000D_
logistics and intelligence and supplies, but trainers and _x000D_
troops._x000D_
    How do we connect the mandates, the mission, and the _x000D_
capacity to deliver in the field?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Let me come back, maybe if I could, just by way of response _x000D_
to something Senator Corker mentioned before, which is the _x000D_
contrast with NATO. I mean, I just want to underscore this _x000D_
really is an example where we have national security interests _x000D_
in peacekeepers, in troops from other countries, performing _x000D_
ably. This is not a NATO situation where we are carrying a _x000D_
disproportionate share of the troop burden. We are carrying a _x000D_
large share of the financial burden. And that is something, _x000D_
again, we are working to ensure is allocated more fairly._x000D_
    I think on the mandate troop-contributor disconnect, which _x000D_
is real, and I think it is real across the board, the first _x000D_
thing you have to do is get more quality troops. It has been, _x000D_
as you know well, a supply-driven market insofar as the U.N. _x000D_
basically goes begging bowl in hand to different countries. _x000D_
There is no standing army that exists in New York. The _x000D_
Secretary General does not have anything at his disposal beyond _x000D_
what he can extract from U.N. member states._x000D_
    That process had yielded a very uneven set of troops and _x000D_
police to participate in these missions, some who have _x000D_
extensive military experience at home and we know are capable _x000D_
troops, but once they get in a peacekeeping setting, they do _x000D_
not fundamentally believe in a civilian protection mandate. _x000D_
They want to go back to traditional principles of peacekeeping, _x000D_
the way peacekeeping was done back in the 1970s and 1980s. And _x000D_
that is just not the world we are in._x000D_
    So I think the first answer is you increase the _x000D_
sophistication, the training, the professionalization of the _x000D_
troops, and there is going to be an effect on the ability to _x000D_
perform the mandates._x000D_
    But the second answer is on us, as a permanent member of _x000D_
the Security Council, which is, there needs to be more _x000D_
prioritization in the way that these mandates are put in place. _x000D_
It is hard in the real world to prioritize, because you look at _x000D_
a situation like that in South Sudan or that in Congo, and what _x000D_
of the tasks that those peacekeepers are slated to perform _x000D_
would you give up? Would you give up demobilization? Would you _x000D_
give up security sector reform? Would you give up human rights _x000D_
monitoring? Would you give up attention to child soldiers or _x000D_
sexual violence? Of course not._x000D_
    So you need to make sure that the missions are right-sized. _x000D_
You need, maybe, to do some sequencing in terms of building out _x000D_
some of those capabilities over time. And the U.N. country team _x000D_
and our bilateral assistance also needs to be involved in _x000D_
strengthening state institutions, because fundamentally whether _x000D_
it is the Central African Republic or eastern Congo or South _x000D_
Sudan, U.N. peacekeepers de facto are having to perform the _x000D_
work of states, because the states themselves are so weak._x000D_
    And so, again, there is no panacea. And for all of the _x000D_
complaints that we have about U.N. peacekeeping, I would _x000D_
challenge all of us to imagine what any one of those countries _x000D_
would be like without this somewhat stabilizing presence. But _x000D_
it is not going to be a cure-all for as long as you have state _x000D_
institutions that do not function, or leaders that are corrupt, _x000D_
or militia on the loose who are interested in carrying out _x000D_
horrors against their civilians."
2923714,2923713,2923715,19198,2,"    I have seen exactly those challenges in the _x000D_
countries I referenced, among others. So I continue as an _x000D_
appropriator to advocate for funding peacekeeping and for _x000D_
dealing with some of these challenges. So it is very _x000D_
encouraging for me to see your engagement and hard work on _x000D_
reform, because for this to be cost-effective and yet reflect _x000D_
our values, we need to make some real progress in the areas _x000D_
around accountability and protection of civilians that you have _x000D_
referenced._x000D_
    Let me just ask sort of a last question and then take what _x000D_
time you have left to answer. I am concerned about sort of _x000D_
growing the universe of capable peacekeepers, both in Africa _x000D_
and globally. China made a pledge of a standby force of 8,000 _x000D_
peacekeepers, and I am interested in what you think is the _x000D_
future, where they will or will not be deployed, what this _x000D_
commitment means. And I am concerned about the African Union _x000D_
and A-Prep, and would love to hear how you see that playing out _x000D_
going forward, and how we can sustain that investment in a _x000D_
continent-wide force._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you._x000D_
    Well, again, I just want to stress how unusual President _x000D_
Obama's personal leadership on this has been. And he has _x000D_
basically told us that anything he can do to ensure that these _x000D_
commitments are followed through on, he is prepared to invest _x000D_
his own time, and the Vice President the same._x000D_
    So we are dealing with a set of challenges at a level that _x000D_
I do not think we have seen before, and with a degree of _x000D_
aggressiveness that we have not seen before from the United _x000D_
States, notwithstanding the fact that, again, on a bipartisan _x000D_
basis I think successive administrations have seen the value of _x000D_
this tool in the American and multilateral toolbox._x000D_
    I think that the A-Prep and the China question kind of come _x000D_
together a little bit. We have a major issue in terms of the _x000D_
delay between the time a mandate is given a U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
force and the time in which troops and police are deployed into _x000D_
theater._x000D_
    Now again, some of this just goes back to the troop-_x000D_
contributing countries and their ability to turn on a dime, and _x000D_
train, and get configured, and get their equipment all lined _x000D_
up._x000D_
    A-Prep is designed to take the six militaries, all of whom _x000D_
are have a good record within peacekeeping of being aggressive _x000D_
in protecting civilians and having the political will to go to _x000D_
dangerous places, and we aim to then ensure through deepening _x000D_
our provision of equipment and the particular forms of training _x000D_
we offer, that they can get into the theater more quickly than _x000D_
they have been up to this point. A lot of them lack their own _x000D_
ability to lift themselves, so sometimes we have to be _x000D_
involved, as we were in the Central African Republic for the _x000D_
Burundians and Rwandans, to swoop in and actually carry people _x000D_
into harm's way. But they need to acquire, over time, the lift _x000D_
and the self-sustainment, and, again, this ability to if not be _x000D_
formally on standby, to be ready to go when the 911 comes._x000D_
    China's commitment of 8,000 troops is a very large piece of _x000D_
business and was a very significant announcement out of _x000D_
President Obama's summit. I do not think we, yet, have a sense, _x000D_
nor does the U.N., of how they imagine allocating that set of _x000D_
forces over time._x000D_
    Right now, they have just deployed their first infantry _x000D_
battalion ever, and that is in South Sudan. The reports are _x000D_
quite promising in terms of how active those troops are, out _x000D_
and about, but also protecting civilians in the displaced _x000D_
person camps._x000D_
    So we need to look and see how the U.N. chooses to use that _x000D_
commitment._x000D_
    Rapid response, if that were something that China could put _x000D_
on offer, where you could actually lose less time between the _x000D_
time the international community comes together with a _x000D_
consensus that a mission is needed and the time when troops _x000D_
show up. I mean, in South Sudan we are 2 years after the _x000D_
original deployment, and they are still not at full troop _x000D_
strength. And that is a recurring pattern. So we would welcome _x000D_
rapid response._x000D_
    Of course, we also need to make sure that any peacekeeper _x000D_
that deploys has the mindset where they are willing to protect _x000D_
civilians and put themselves at risk for the sake of the _x000D_
mandate."
2923715,2923714,2923716,19198,2,"    Thank you, Madam Ambassador._x000D_
    Thank you, Chairman."
2923716,2923715,2923717,19198,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Gardner?"
2923717,2923716,2923718,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you, Madam Ambassador, for your time and _x000D_
testimony today. And, of course, thank you as well for your _x000D_
service to this country._x000D_
    I want to follow up a little bit on what Chairman Corker _x000D_
and Senator Perdue were asking about, and that is Security _x000D_
Council Resolutions 1929 and 2231. Of course, we know there was _x000D_
a second ballistic missile test from Iran, which was a clear _x000D_
violation of these resolutions._x000D_
    After the first launch in October, we referred, as you _x000D_
said, the matter to the United Nations, and called on it to _x000D_
``review this matter quickly and recommend appropriate _x000D_
action.'' On October 22, I believe you stated, and I quote, _x000D_
``The United States will continue to press the Security Council _x000D_
to respond effectively to any future violations of U.N. _x000D_
Security Council resolutions. Full and robust enforcement of _x000D_
all relevant U.N. measures is and will remain critical.''_x000D_
    So as of today, has the United Nations Security Council or _x000D_
sanctions committee taken any actions in response to the _x000D_
Iranian missile test? And I believe the answer is, no, they are _x000D_
meeting Tuesday. Is that correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes. Beyond having Security Council _x000D_
discussions of the matter, there has been no follow-on action. _x000D_
Discussions are a form of U.N. action. It is a little bit like _x000D_
hearing is a form of congressional action. So we have had _x000D_
multiple discussions."
2923718,2923717,2923719,19198,2,"    The Tuesday meeting, can you describe the _x000D_
actions that will be taken in that Tuesday meeting?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We will hear back. Well, we will _x000D_
actually probably not yet hear back from the panel of experts. _x000D_
But if we are in a position to confirm the recent launch, this _x000D_
is something that we would bring to the council. We are not yet _x000D_
in a position to confirm, but are looking to confirm those _x000D_
reports, if warranted._x000D_
    And again, we will get an update from the U.N. in terms of _x000D_
when the panel of experts' report is going to come back."
2923719,2923718,2923720,19198,2,"    And so this launch needs to be confirmed, _x000D_
but the last launch, we still have not taken any action on the _x000D_
last launch?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Again, we have taken action."
2923720,2923719,2923721,19198,2,"    What are those actions?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We confirmed the violation. We brought _x000D_
it to the U.N. Security Council, and the panel of experts is _x000D_
investigating the matter and will report back."
2923721,2923720,2923722,19198,2,"    So what other actions has the _x000D_
administration taken in response to the missile test, other _x000D_
than taking it to the panel, talking about it, and having a _x000D_
meeting?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We are looking also, as I mentioned _x000D_
earlier, at the bilateral sanctions tools that we have at our _x000D_
disposal. So that is something, again, that the Treasury _x000D_
Department is following up on."
2923722,2923721,2923723,19198,2,"    What unilateral measures are we _x000D_
considering?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I believe sanctions designations, _x000D_
bearing in mind that that most actors--I shouldn't say _x000D_
``most''--many of the actors involved in ballistic missile _x000D_
launches in the program itself are already sanctioned under _x000D_
U.S. law."
2923723,2923722,2923724,19198,2,"    And are we considering stopping sanctions _x000D_
relief from proceeding or rescinded any previous relief, as a _x000D_
result of these actions?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. The JCPOA, as you know, the sanctions _x000D_
relief associated with the JCPOA, will not occur until after _x000D_
the initial steps have been taken and the IAEA has verified _x000D_
that those initial nuclear-related steps are taken._x000D_
    But I want to underscore, again, that the point of the _x000D_
JCPOA is to dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons program, and that _x000D_
is a really important area of emphasis for us."
2923724,2923723,2923725,19198,2,"    So more important than the ballistic _x000D_
missile concerns?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I do not want to talk about relative _x000D_
importance, but taking away Iran's--I think this is something _x000D_
all of us can agree upon--actually ensuring that Iran does not _x000D_
develop a nuclear weapon is a huge priority."
2923725,2923724,2923726,19198,2,"    You mentioned in your opening statement, _x000D_
you said, and I quote, ``exploit vacuum of authority.'' I think _x000D_
you were referring to actors in the Middle East and other _x000D_
terrorists, that they were maybe trying to exploit a vacuum of _x000D_
authority._x000D_
    By not imposing sanctions, by not designating individuals, _x000D_
by not doing anything other than talking, are we not allowing _x000D_
exploitation of a vacuum of authority?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. This administration has put in place, in _x000D_
the case of the Iran sanctions regime, as you know, this body, _x000D_
the Congress, in the first instance, and then amplified and _x000D_
extended by what we have done at the U.N., the most devastating _x000D_
sanctions regime in the 70-year history of the United Nations._x000D_
    So I do not think there is a void or a vacuum. Iran has _x000D_
seen the consequences of violating international norms. We also _x000D_
have a sanction snapback provision that I think few around the _x000D_
world would have thought we could have secured as part of this _x000D_
deal, which would allow any single country to snap back in the _x000D_
event of significant noncompliance with the deal._x000D_
    So sanctions are a really important tool. The sanctions _x000D_
that this Congress has put in place is one reason we are in the _x000D_
position we are now to ensure that Iran does not develop a _x000D_
nuclear weapon."
2923726,2923725,2923727,19198,2,"    But nothing has been done, other than a _x000D_
meeting coming up on Tuesday with a panel of experts on a _x000D_
ballistic missile violation._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We have increased, and will continue to _x000D_
increase, the political cost to Iran when it violates U.N. _x000D_
Security Council resolutions."
2923727,2923726,2923728,19198,2,"    Could you give me an example of that?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. The work that Iran does to try to ensure _x000D_
that the U.N. Security Council does not even discuss ballistic _x000D_
missile launches, I assure you, is a testament to actually the _x000D_
stigma that they still associate with our bringing these issues _x000D_
before the Security Council, the same with the panel of experts _x000D_
actually discussing this and documenting any violation._x000D_
    This is something that Iran, which, of course, wants to _x000D_
become a nation like any other nation within the U.N., they _x000D_
find it very frustrating that they continue to be scrutinized. _x000D_
They have never recognized, as you know, the U.N. Security _x000D_
Council resolutions, so the fact that the council keeps _x000D_
functioning, keeps oversight, keeps the spotlight on, increases _x000D_
the political cost, is an important step."
2923728,2923727,2923729,19198,2,"    In October, many members of this committee _x000D_
sent a letter to the Secretary of State talking about Iran's _x000D_
October 10 ballistic missile. The letter talks about a range of _x000D_
unilateral, multilateral tools available to counter Iran's _x000D_
missile-related activities on past occasions, imposed penalties _x000D_
under domestic authorities on foreign persons and entities _x000D_
engaged in proliferation activities._x000D_
    But we have done nothing. We have imposed no penalties _x000D_
under domestic authorities or on foreign persons and entities, _x000D_
as a result of these two launches. Is that correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I want to just underscore the importance _x000D_
of the broader ballistic missile defense efforts that we make. _x000D_
I feel like I have answered the question you have just posed _x000D_
several times, so let me try a different broadening approach, _x000D_
which is our response to Iranian ballistic missile launches is _x000D_
also a defense response. It is also the Proliferation Security _x000D_
Initiative. It is everything that has come out of Camp David _x000D_
and our engagement with the Gulf countries to ensure _x000D_
interoperability. It is the Iron Dome and all of the other _x000D_
bilateral defense arrangements that we have with the country of _x000D_
Israel, many of which are getting deepened, as you know, in _x000D_
consultations."
2923729,2923728,2923730,19198,2,"    They have launched twice. Is that working? _x000D_
If they have had two launches now, one in October, one _x000D_
recently, is it----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I mean, if one is thinking in terms of _x000D_
regional defense, one has to take measures in order to try to _x000D_
ensure that our partners in the region have the tools to defend _x000D_
themselves._x000D_
    Even if you had a designation against someone involved in _x000D_
the ballistic missiles program, the number one deterrent and _x000D_
preventive measure is going to be regional defense. That is _x000D_
where our emphasis was._x000D_
    If I were here and we had designated another actor _x000D_
bilaterally--let us say we find one that has not already been _x000D_
designated and designate, I do not think that that would _x000D_
address your concern about Iran's ballistic missile program, _x000D_
nor should it._x000D_
    So again, Iran has systematically ignored U.N. Security _x000D_
Council resolutions over the life of the entire international _x000D_
Security Council regime. The sanctions themselves were so _x000D_
crippling and brought us to the place where we could secure _x000D_
this deal because the other countries in the international _x000D_
system would be sanctioned if they were engaging with Iran in _x000D_
prohibited behavior."
2923730,2923729,2923731,19198,2,"    This systematic ignoring of the _x000D_
resolutions, does that not give you concern about their _x000D_
willingness to comply, going forward?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. That is why we have snapback. That is _x000D_
why we have verification monitoring on the ground. As the _x000D_
President said from the beginning, this is not an agreement _x000D_
predicated on trust, particularly in light of Iran's past _x000D_
behavior, past behavior, again, confirmed by the IAEA PMD _x000D_
report."
2923731,2923730,2923732,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923732,2923731,2923733,19198,2,"    Before going on to Senator Kaine, I just want _x000D_
to reiterate, I think what Ben and I did the other day with you _x000D_
and the other members. I think regardless of how people may _x000D_
have voted on the Iran agreement, we understand that it is what _x000D_
is governing our actions right now with Iran. And I think on _x000D_
both sides of the aisle, regardless of how people voted, we _x000D_
want to make sure the agreement is implemented in the way that _x000D_
it was laid out._x000D_
    And I think there has been a concern on both sides of the _x000D_
aisle that there is an air of permissiveness that is developing _x000D_
that will cause the likelihood of any pushback on Iranian _x000D_
violations over time to become less real. And I think that is _x000D_
what he's getting at and I think what people on both sides of _x000D_
aisle have been concerned about._x000D_
    U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 says they shall not _x000D_
undertake any ballistic activity. Unfortunately, JPOA says ``is _x000D_
called upon.'' I do not know whether Iran views that as _x000D_
permissive language._x000D_
    But this is an issue that I think many people on both sides _x000D_
of the aisle are concerned about. I cannot speak for everyone._x000D_
    And what we are seeing is, again, not very vigilant steps _x000D_
being taken, and it is setting a precedent for the future._x000D_
    With that, Senator Kaine."
2923733,2923732,2923734,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chair._x000D_
    And thank you, Ambassador Power._x000D_
    You gave an interview to the PBS NewsHour on December 4, _x000D_
and you noted that more progress needs to be made in uniting _x000D_
the anti-ISIL coalition. Would our unified resolve against ISIL _x000D_
be clearer to our allies, to our troops, and to ISIL if _x000D_
Congress was willing to finally debate and vote on this matter _x000D_
after 16 months of war?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes, Senator. Thank you for your _x000D_
leadership on this issue from the very start._x000D_
    I think people are puzzled as to why--people that I work _x000D_
with, I should say, day-to-day up at the U.N.--are puzzled, _x000D_
given the priority that the American people and, on a _x000D_
bipartisan basis, both houses of Congress attach to the anti-_x000D_
ISIL struggle and all of the attention to it that has come over _x000D_
the course of the last 2 years as to how we cannot arrive at _x000D_
some consensus in order to be able to enshrine in legislation _x000D_
that which we say is true, which is, again, that this has the _x000D_
bipartisan backing of the American people and of the Congress._x000D_
    So I think it would be a really important signal if we _x000D_
could get that AUMF done."
2923734,2923733,2923735,19198,2,"    I have not done the research on this, but _x000D_
just from headlines and my memory, it strikes me that at least _x000D_
three of the U.N. Security Council nations--Britain, France, _x000D_
and, I am sad to say, Russia--have had their legislative bodies _x000D_
vote to confirm and approve after a debate their military _x000D_
activity against terrorism in Syria and Iraq. Is that correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. That is my understanding, as well, and I _x000D_
think other countries who are part of the coalition, but not on _x000D_
the Security Council, also, we could add to that list."
2923735,2923734,2923736,19198,2,"    Germany, for example._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Denmark, et cetera."
2923736,2923735,2923737,19198,2,"    Bundestag acted last week._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes."
2923737,2923736,2923738,19198,2,"    Last week, the chairman of the Senate Armed _x000D_
Services Committee, Senator McCain, said this, he did not say _x000D_
this approvingly, so I do not want to suggest that he was _x000D_
saying it approvingly, but when he was asked when an _x000D_
authorization vote would occur in Congress, he said, ``It may _x000D_
require an attack on the United States of America.''_x000D_
    In terms of you being able to do your job well, would it be _x000D_
a good idea for Congress to wait that long?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. No, it would not be a good idea for _x000D_
Congress to wait that long. I think this should be one issue _x000D_
that everyone in this country can agree upon, even those who _x000D_
have differences over tactics, over the number of trainers, or _x000D_
different aspects of the operations as they are unfolding. _x000D_
Everyone should agree that defeating and degrading ISIL and _x000D_
showing the world that this is something that is backed by the _x000D_
Congress, rendering these operations sustainable and enduring _x000D_
over what is a long struggle, would just be invaluable."
2923738,2923737,2923739,19198,2,"    The President started this war against ISIL _x000D_
on August 8, which was 16 months ago yesterday. A year ago _x000D_
Friday, the only vote that has happened in Congress, in terms _x000D_
of an authorization, occurred in this committee on December 11, _x000D_
2014, an authorization that was reported to the Senate floor _x000D_
where no action was taken on it._x000D_
    The RAND Corporation issued a report to the Pentagon this _x000D_
week that said relying upon the 2001 and 2002 authorizations at _x000D_
a minimum involved legal gymnastics that were not helpful, and _x000D_
urged Congress to take action. It is just my hope that we will _x000D_
do that, and it is my hope that it will not take a kind of _x000D_
cataclysm that was suggested, again, disapprovingly by Senator _x000D_
McCain. I think Senator McCain views it the way that I do, that _x000D_
he thinks Congress should act._x000D_
    Let me ask you this, moving to peacekeeping, a good news _x000D_
story, you talked about European nations having scaled back _x000D_
peacekeeping operations. A good news story for this committee _x000D_
and for this Congress is Colombia stepping up in September and _x000D_
saying they wanted to devote 5,000 troops to the U.N. _x000D_
peacekeeping mission. Colombia is also a peacekeeping _x000D_
participant in the multinational force and observers in the _x000D_
Sinai, as of relatively recently._x000D_
    We sometimes wonder whether U.S. engagement on a diplomatic _x000D_
way can make a difference. Colombia is an example of failed _x000D_
state to international security partner in a way that I think _x000D_
this committee in a bipartisan way can be proud. And, also, _x000D_
three administrations, the Clinton administration, the Bush _x000D_
administration, and the Obama administration, have had a _x000D_
dedication to that._x000D_
    Talk about nations like Colombia who are coming into _x000D_
providing peacekeeping forces for the first time and the degree _x000D_
to which we can encourage them._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    We view that commitment in very much the same way. It _x000D_
seemed also a real reflection of, however difficult the peace _x000D_
process is, and there is a lot of work left to do, but their _x000D_
confidence they are going to get where they need to get to be _x000D_
in a position to free up resources to be part of international _x000D_
peace and security._x000D_
    Latin America has a huge contribution to make. One of the _x000D_
significant features of the President's summit was a number of _x000D_
Latin American countries announcing that they were prepared to _x000D_
do peacekeeping out of hemisphere, because a lot of Latin _x000D_
American countries had been dedicating their forces in Haiti._x000D_
    I want to particularly commend Uruguay, because they have _x000D_
actually been taking lead within the region at mobilizing _x000D_
different contributions, working with the Colombians, saying _x000D_
this is how it worked for us, this is how it will work for you._x000D_
    I also want to commend Mexico, which I visited recently, _x000D_
which has announced that it will break new ground and be _x000D_
involved in peacekeeping for the first time. It is in the midst _x000D_
of discussions now with the U.N. as to what form that will _x000D_
take._x000D_
    If I could just touch upon, because I think it is such an _x000D_
important point, the larger point, the pulling up from Latin _x000D_
America, which is the dividend for us when a country makes _x000D_
progress domestically, whether in terms of democratization or _x000D_
in terms of conflict resolution._x000D_
    I just am back from Sri Lanka, a place that, in the wake of _x000D_
its defeat of the LTTE, the people who, in effect, coined the _x000D_
suicide bomb, really regressed in terms of creeping _x000D_
authoritarianism, horrible atrocities carried out at the tail _x000D_
end of the war and no accountability for that._x000D_
    Now there has been a change in government. Not only do we _x000D_
see them domestically taking on issues of accountability, _x000D_
trying to work on reconciliation with the Tamil population, but _x000D_
we also see their behavior within international institutions _x000D_
transformed, also making a very substantial commitment to _x000D_
peacekeeping, the stand they take on human rights resolutions, _x000D_
on Syria, on North Korea, et cetera, shifting._x000D_
    So I want to just dwell on this point because sometimes one _x000D_
looks at the U.N. and it is just this black box where we are _x000D_
not getting the returns that we want, we are not getting the _x000D_
votes that we want. The way the U.N. changes over time is _x000D_
countries that comprise it change, and they become more at _x000D_
peace within themselves. They democratize. Their institutions _x000D_
get stronger. And we see a payoff, again, in terms of the _x000D_
critical mass of countries then that we have as partners in New _x000D_
York to work with._x000D_
    Right now, it is still the case, though, that more than _x000D_
half the countries in the U.N. are not democratic. That affects _x000D_
the extent to which the U.N. is going to be a tool on democracy _x000D_
promotion or human rights enforcement, et cetera."
2923739,2923738,2923740,19198,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, sir."
2923740,2923739,2923741,19198,2,"    Thank you. The vote has gone off, and Senator _x000D_
Isakson is next. After him is Senator Menendez._x000D_
    I would ask you, if you would, to chair the meeting while _x000D_
you are asking questions."
2923741,2923740,2923742,19198,2,"    I am going to be very brief, because I _x000D_
have to go to the floor, too."
2923742,2923741,2923743,19198,2,"    Okay, then Senator Murphy is next after _x000D_
Senator Menendez. If we would just keep it going, and I am _x000D_
going to bolt and come back. And thank you both very much. I _x000D_
know it will be orderly, regardless."
2923743,2923742,2923744,19198,2,"    So you want me to yield to Senator Murphy _x000D_
after I finish?"
2923744,2923743,2923745,19198,2,    If Menendez is not back. Thank you.
2923745,2923744,2923746,19198,2,"    [Presiding] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and _x000D_
thank you for calling this hearing. I am going to be very _x000D_
brief, because I have to do a part of this in just a minute on _x000D_
the floor._x000D_
    But required reading of every Member of Congress and of _x000D_
every Ambassador to the United Nations ought to be Samantha _x000D_
Power's book ``A Problem from U.N. .'' If that book had been _x000D_
read, a lot of the problems we are talking about today in _x000D_
peacekeeping missions and rape being used as a military tactic _x000D_
and things like that, we would be a lot further along than we _x000D_
are today. That is a great book and everybody should read it._x000D_
    Senator Corker and I went to Rwanda. We know about the _x000D_
Kigali Principles, and that is my first question to you._x000D_
    As a country, have we adopted the Kigali Principles? Has _x000D_
the United States of America done that?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. As you know, we are not a substantial _x000D_
contributor to peacekeeping. So these principals so far have _x000D_
been embraced by the big countries that are putting thousands _x000D_
of troops in harm's way. We have 40 police officer and 40 _x000D_
military officers, all of whom we are incredibly grateful for._x000D_
    So we have not yet, but more for that reason than any _x000D_
substantive objection. If you support our joining, I can convey _x000D_
that back."
2923746,2923745,2923747,19198,2,"    Let me make my point. When I read your _x000D_
speech last night, you did not include this part in the speech, _x000D_
but it is in the printed speech, you talked the Kigali _x000D_
Principles and what they were developed from, which was a _x000D_
learning lesson, I think, from what you pointed out in ``A _x000D_
Problem from U.N. ,'' your book._x000D_
    The Kigali Principles, as I understand it, is that _x000D_
peacekeepers, their countries need to affirm that their troops _x000D_
will have the authorization to use force when necessary and do _x000D_
not have to radio back to headquarters to get approval. Is that _x000D_
correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Correct, sir."
2923747,2923746,2923748,19198,2,"    That is our problem in the Middle East _x000D_
right now, in terms of the United States. I do not think we _x000D_
have enough of that type of authorization for the rules of _x000D_
engagement of our own troops. I commend you for raising it on _x000D_
this question. But I think it is a bigger question, in terms of _x000D_
our being able to be effective, and that is to have the troops _x000D_
in the field that you have deployed, either for peacekeeping or _x000D_
for war, if you are at war, to have the actual authority for _x000D_
use of force they need to carry out their mission._x000D_
    It kind of struck me that we were congratulating Sri Lanka _x000D_
and Korea and a lot of people who provide peacekeeping troops. _x000D_
Yet we as a country have very limited rules of engagement _x000D_
authorization right now as a practice in our own country. So _x000D_
that is my reason for bringing the point up._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. If I may just respond briefly, Senator, _x000D_
while you are here. You know, my impression is not that. I _x000D_
think that what President Obama has conveyed to the Secretary _x000D_
of Defense and to the chairman and to his commander, General _x000D_
Austin and the commanders on the ground, is a desire to offer _x000D_
strategic guidance, discuss any big shifts in the strategy at a _x000D_
senior level to make sure everybody is on the same page._x000D_
    But there is a huge amount of tactical and operational _x000D_
flexibility that these commanders have. And I think you have _x000D_
seen, certainly, the President say publically what he has also _x000D_
conveyed many times privately in the Situation Room, which is, _x000D_
if there are ideas for how we can pursue this campaign more _x000D_
expeditiously in ways that increase the security dividend for _x000D_
the American people sooner, I want to see those ideas._x000D_
    And so I am in these meetings where we are discussing the _x000D_
way ahead in our anti-ISIL strategy, and I, again, have not _x000D_
heard the commanders not getting the flexibility that they _x000D_
seek."
2923748,2923747,2923749,19198,2,"    Thank you for your answer, and thank you _x000D_
for your service._x000D_
    My last question is not a question but a statement, and _x000D_
that is to thank you. Your wagon is loaded and gets a new load _x000D_
every day, and I think you are doing a terrific job. But I _x000D_
would underscore, as I leave, Senator Cardin's remarks, and _x000D_
those of Senator Perdue and the chairman, the more _x000D_
transparency, the better for the U.N. There is a lot of _x000D_
suspicion, a lot of misunderstandings. And there is a lot of _x000D_
lack of trust out there in the general public. The more _x000D_
transparency we can have, particularly on who is paying what _x000D_
and how they are paying their share, would be helpful to the _x000D_
U.N. mission in having the support it really needs to carry out _x000D_
its intent from the beginning._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, Senator, that gives me the chance _x000D_
to invite you to New York so you can get immersed in those _x000D_
budget numbers firsthand. But we would really welcome visits by _x000D_
members of this body, and we would give you a good and deep _x000D_
tour of the U.N. and so many of the Africa-related issues that _x000D_
you have worked so hard on._x000D_
    As you know, the U.N. is on the frontlines."
2923749,2923748,2923750,19198,2,"    Invitation accepted._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Okay, great. Thank you."
2923750,2923749,2923751,19198,2,    Senator Murphy?
2923751,2923750,2923752,19198,2,"    Thank you, Senator Isakson._x000D_
    Good morning, Ambassador Power._x000D_
    The evening of the President's Sunday night speech, there _x000D_
was a series of social media postings by a really wonderful _x000D_
reporter from the New York Times, Rukmini Callimachi. She wrote _x000D_
a piece based on those observations the next day and the title _x000D_
was ``U.S. Strategy Seeks to Avoid ISIS Prophecy.'' And the _x000D_
idea is that, if you really understand the fundamentals, the _x000D_
building blocks, of the religious perversion of ISIS, it is _x000D_
built upon a prophecy, a hope, a belief, that ultimately they _x000D_
are going to be in a military contest on the ground with the _x000D_
United States and with Western powers. I suspect that that _x000D_
acknowledgement is part of what made the President in that _x000D_
speech talk about not only the things we should do but the _x000D_
things we shouldn't do._x000D_
    I understand that we are not going to be putting U.N. _x000D_
peacekeepers on the ground inside a complicated, violent civil _x000D_
war any time soon, but from a broader perspective, can you talk _x000D_
about, as we try to confront organizations that are in _x000D_
countries like Mali that have peacekeeping forces, that are _x000D_
trying to goad the West and, in particular, the United States _x000D_
into a military confrontation, why multinational and _x000D_
multiethnic forces are going to be perhaps best positioned, _x000D_
much better positioned than a majority U.S. force, to try to _x000D_
preserve peace and order? And maybe as part of that answer, _x000D_
talk about the contributions that majority-Muslim nations make _x000D_
to peacekeeping or could or should make in the future, if that _x000D_
is amongst the reasons why we should be paying more attention _x000D_
to investment in peacekeeping._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator Murphy. It is a _x000D_
complex question and set of ideas within it._x000D_
    I think a key to effective deployments is legitimacy. And _x000D_
one of the things that multinational deployments can offer, but _x000D_
can also forfeit, as we have been talking about in the context _x000D_
of sexual abuse, is a perception of legitimacy, a perception _x000D_
that the whole world is behind a peacekeeping mission._x000D_
    In truth, I think have a 65-nation coalition also enhances _x000D_
legitimacy. And the fact that countries from the region are _x000D_
part of that against ISIL is very important. It was something _x000D_
that was very important to the President to secure that kind of _x000D_
regional support._x000D_
    The one thing that I would note in areas where terrorists _x000D_
are active, and Mali now with 44 deaths of peacekeepers just _x000D_
over the life of a mission that has been in place only a few _x000D_
years underscores, is that there can be a mismatch between U.N. _x000D_
peacekeeping and even robust U.N. peacekeeping, which we _x000D_
support, and the Kigali Principles show that a lot of other _x000D_
troop-contributing countries support, and these kinds of _x000D_
environments where extremists and terrorists, yes, they may _x000D_
make the United States their number one target, if they have _x000D_
that opportunity, but if there are no Americans around, they _x000D_
are also perfectly prepared to target Chadians and Dutch _x000D_
peacekeepers and Burkina Faso peacekeepers._x000D_
    So I want to stress that I agree very much, I think, with _x000D_
the logic of the article that you have described and found it a _x000D_
very powerful look at ISIL's ideology._x000D_
    I will use the question as an occasion to alert the _x000D_
committee to the extent to which peacekeeping is being _x000D_
increasingly seen as a soft target for terrorists and _x000D_
extremists in those environments that they inhabit. And we have _x000D_
a really significant national interest in hardening these _x000D_
missions, in ensuring that they have the training they need to _x000D_
operate in these evermore not only complex environments because _x000D_
conflict is still going on, but complex because you combine _x000D_
conflict and the actual fact that the peacekeepers themselves _x000D_
are a target._x000D_
    And just to give you one example of how I think the Defense _x000D_
Department has been responsive in this regard, we are now doing _x000D_
more and more counter-IED training for peacekeepers. I mean, _x000D_
talk about not your mother's peacekeeping. If anybody would _x000D_
have imagined at the outset of peacekeeping that people would _x000D_
have to train against IEDs that were presumably targeting the _x000D_
peacekeepers themselves, I am not sure peacekeeping would have _x000D_
ever gotten off the ground._x000D_
    So I think your larger point is right. Having countries who _x000D_
know the language, I think that is a critical component, that _x000D_
have cultural overlap with those countries in which they are _x000D_
operating is really important._x000D_
    The only other challenge is that sometimes countries can be _x000D_
too familiar with a country. One of the reasons the _x000D_
international community went to U.N. peacekeeping in the first _x000D_
place is to try to inject actually more distance so there would _x000D_
be a greater perception of independence and one would not be _x000D_
seen as being a stakeholder on one side or the other._x000D_
    So all of these factors, I think, need to be taken into _x000D_
account."
2923752,2923751,2923753,19198,2,"    [Presiding] Well, thank you. And let me add _x000D_
my thanks to Senator Isakson for the number of heavy lifts that _x000D_
you undertake for us every day in New York. Thank you for your _x000D_
time._x000D_
    And I will turn it over to Senator Menendez._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator."
2923753,2923752,2923754,19198,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    And in appreciation of the chairman's courtesies, I am not _x000D_
going to ask for unanimous consent for anything I want right _x000D_
now, since I am here alone. [Laughter.]"
2923754,2923753,2923755,19198,2,"    So let me let me, first of all, _x000D_
Ambassador, say I appreciate your service to our country, and I _x000D_
have a high regard for you._x000D_
    And my own personal view is that, left to your own devices, _x000D_
on some issues, you might be more forward-leaning. You do not _x000D_
need to respond to that. It is just my observation._x000D_
    Having said that, however, let me enlarge this conversation _x000D_
about peacekeeping. I know some of my colleagues have broached _x000D_
this subject already._x000D_
    Peacekeeping is, yes, very important in the sense of what _x000D_
the core of this hearing is about, but part of the way in which _x000D_
you keep the peace is to make sure that the will of the _x000D_
international community is observed and that it is not _x000D_
violated, and if it is violated, that there are consequences so _x000D_
that, hopefully, a continuation of that breach does not lead to _x000D_
the outbreak of war and, therefore, what flows from that._x000D_
    So I want to come to the issue of Iran. I know several of _x000D_
my colleagues have pursued the core of the missile test. But _x000D_
first of all, I would like to ask you, would you agree with me _x000D_
that for well over a decade, Iran, as you have said in response _x000D_
to some of my colleagues' questions, did not recognize U.N. _x000D_
Security Council resolutions and moved their nuclear program _x000D_
forward to a point in which it got so big--too-big-to-fail, in _x000D_
the bank context? Well, this was too big to actually end._x000D_
    So they violated the international will purposely, and in _x000D_
doing so were able to get to a point that they largely wanted _x000D_
to. Would that be a fair observation?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes, they violated international _x000D_
resolutions and built up their program. Again, I think this is _x000D_
probably not the venue to get into the extent of the program."
2923755,2923754,2923756,19198,2,"    No._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. But such that----"
2923756,2923755,2923757,19198,2,"    That is pretty well-documented._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes."
2923757,2923756,2923758,19198,2,"    But in any event, and in plenty of public _x000D_
discourse, as well._x000D_
    But the point is they violated international resolutions _x000D_
for----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Absolutely._x000D_
    Senator Menendez.--the better part of a decade._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes."
2923758,2923757,2923759,19198,2,"    And during those violations, they _x000D_
progressed, for a good period of time without the type of _x000D_
sanctions regime that was largely generated by the Congress, _x000D_
not by the executive branch._x000D_
    And so I look at that, and I look at your acknowledgement _x000D_
that they have not recognized Security Council resolutions, and _x000D_
I say to myself, there is a history here and a pattern. If you _x000D_
go visit the Archives building with me, over its mantel it _x000D_
says, ``What is past is prologue.''_x000D_
    And I have a real concern that what we have here is a lack _x000D_
of will by the United States and as a leader in this regard by _x000D_
our partners in going ahead and making sure that Iran _x000D_
understands that you cannot violate the international will _x000D_
without consequence, which I consider, even as I did not _x000D_
support the agreement, that to the extent that the agreement is _x000D_
going to produce any benefits, Iran must clearly understand _x000D_
that there will be consequences for not following that _x000D_
agreement._x000D_
    And the message it seems to me that we are sending and that _x000D_
we have sent as a country in various iterations is quite the _x000D_
contrary._x000D_
    So we, basically, have no real action. I heard your _x000D_
responses about referring it to the committee and having _x000D_
discussions. I get the U.N. process. But the bottom line is _x000D_
there have been no real actions, no consequence._x000D_
    Now they have a second test, and we are talking about _x000D_
verifying. But at the end of the day, it took place and there _x000D_
will be no real consequence._x000D_
    We would like to see the Security Council be the venue for _x000D_
a multilateral consequence, but we hear nothing in the interim _x000D_
about an individual consequence._x000D_
    We see a set of circumstances in which I predicted as well _x000D_
as a whole host of others that on the question of Parchin, we _x000D_
were going to basically sweep this under the rug and ultimately _x000D_
dismiss it, which is now the resolution that is presently being _x000D_
circulated at the IAEA to close this chapter, because we want _x000D_
something bad enough we are willing to go ahead and overlook. _x000D_
In doing so, I think we make a grave mistake._x000D_
    We did that with Cuba, because we wanted to create _x000D_
relations with Cuba even though they violated Security Council _x000D_
resolutions and shipped missiles and MiGs under tons of sugar _x000D_
to North Korea. Nothing happened to them._x000D_
    So when we want something bad enough--when I say ``we,'' _x000D_
the administration wants something bad enough--they are willing _x000D_
to overlook. And that is a dangerous proposition, a dangerous _x000D_
proposition._x000D_
    So what is it that we are going to do to send a real, _x000D_
clear, unequivocal, unambiguous message to the Iranians, _x000D_
because we were all assured here that notwithstanding the _x000D_
nuclear portfolio, that we could be robustly active and take _x000D_
actions on nonnuclear issues. Well, this is a nonnuclear issue. _x000D_
And conversation is not an action._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    So let me use this also as an occasion, since Senator _x000D_
Corker is back, to address a comment he made earlier, which is _x000D_
in keeping with what you are saying, which is his impression of _x000D_
a kind of greater permissiveness and your statement that _x000D_
somehow if you want it bad enough, you are willing to overlook, _x000D_
et cetera._x000D_
    The way that this administration and our predecessors _x000D_
responded in New York to prior recurrent, as it happens over _x000D_
the life of the regime, violations of U.N. Security Council _x000D_
resolutions has not changed. There is no difference in the way _x000D_
that we go through this procedure, what we seek to do in New _x000D_
York at the U.N. Security Council. And, frankly, there is not _x000D_
even much difference in terms of the kinds of resistance we _x000D_
face from predictable quarters._x000D_
    The Security Council regime, as you well know, built out _x000D_
and force multiplied on the sanctions that Congress put in _x000D_
place. And it is that regime that caused Iran to make a series _x000D_
of concessions that for I think the three of you here were not _x000D_
deemed satisfactory, but went well beyond what would have been _x000D_
achievable without the sanctions regime, and gives us the _x000D_
confidence, again, that this is a good deal and one that will _x000D_
dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons program._x000D_
    The objective we have----"
2923759,2923758,2923760,19198,2,"    With all due respect, I am not talking _x000D_
about the deal anymore. We are past that._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. No, we are talking about implementation _x000D_
of the deal."
2923760,2923759,2923761,19198,2,"    I am talking about making sure that we _x000D_
have enforcement of Security Council resolutions that are _x000D_
meaningful._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Agreed. Agreed._x000D_
    But, again, sort of the accusation is that we are seeing _x000D_
things differently than you, because we have a vested interest _x000D_
in seeing this deal implemented. We have a collective, as I _x000D_
think all of you agree, vested interest in seeing this deal _x000D_
implemented, because we do not want Iran to ever obtain a _x000D_
nuclear weapon. That is our objective._x000D_
    And we have put in place measures. It is the expanded _x000D_
verification and monitoring, and even the PMD. For all of the _x000D_
dissatisfaction that has been expressed about the report and _x000D_
our approach to it, fundamentally, the IAEA was able to get _x000D_
access to Parchin in a way that it had not been able to in the _x000D_
past._x000D_
    The snapback of the sanctions regime is an incredibly _x000D_
important tool in our arsenal, and it is leverage. Senator _x000D_
Corker said the other day to the Security Council that we will _x000D_
have given up all our leverage on the frontend. That is just _x000D_
not true. We will have that hanging over implementation, _x000D_
reporting of violations, going forward. And we will have in our _x000D_
toolbox the bilateral sanctions measures as a way of responding _x000D_
to lesser incidents of noncompliance and lesser violations._x000D_
    So, again, the U.N. Security Council is one venue, and we _x000D_
will do as we have been doing for a decade, which is call a _x000D_
spade a spade, bring forward violations, increase the political _x000D_
cost, ensure that Iran is isolated for its violations of 1929 _x000D_
now and 2231, once the implementation day progresses._x000D_
    But we also have a set of other tools aimed at getting at _x000D_
Iranian bad behavior, including ones on this body."
2923761,2923760,2923762,19198,2,"    Mr. Chairman, if I may, since my time has _x000D_
expired, let me just make a comment._x000D_
    You know, I appreciate your answer. You are very good at _x000D_
answering, but not answering._x000D_
    So let me just say that you talk about snapback, those _x000D_
sanctions that you admit and the administration has _x000D_
increasingly admitted brought Iran to the table, they expire _x000D_
this coming year. And you all negotiated away, at least as I _x000D_
read the agreement, the ability for the administration to _x000D_
support a reauthorization of it, which I intend push for, _x000D_
because the snapback means nothing if cannot snap back to _x000D_
something that is meaningful. And the administration just will _x000D_
not talk about that reauthorization, because, as I read the _x000D_
agreement, they do not have the wherewithal to agree to a _x000D_
reauthorization. They gave it away._x000D_
    And then the last point, another example, enforcing _x000D_
Resolution 1701, the transfer of arms to Hezbollah. During the _x000D_
review of Iran nuclear agreement and defending the lifting of _x000D_
the U.N. arms embargo, the administration repeatedly emphasized _x000D_
that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 remains in place, _x000D_
and that prevents the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, and we _x000D_
are going to make sure that that is the case._x000D_
    Well, since the announcement of the JCPOA, Hezbollah has _x000D_
continued to receive arms from outside of Lebanon. So what _x000D_
steps have UNIFIL taken to stop the transfer of arms to _x000D_
Hezbollah? What steps have we taken to stop those transfers?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator. I addressed this _x000D_
question earlier for Senator Perdue, but it is a very important _x000D_
question._x000D_
    I think the point that was made over the course of the _x000D_
discussion about the JCPOA is that authorities, that this body _x000D_
and we were understandably concerned, were going away or could _x000D_
go away at some point under the JCPOA. Many of those _x000D_
authorities were elsewhere in other Security Council _x000D_
resolutions. So I think that was the implication of 1701, in _x000D_
that context._x000D_
    Look, as I said earlier, Hezbollah is a terrorist _x000D_
organization, and UNIFIL is a peacekeeping mission. UNIFIL's _x000D_
job is to do everything in its power to deter Hezbollah from _x000D_
amassing weapons, to call a spade a spade, and to call them out _x000D_
when they are, to alert us and other stakeholders to anything _x000D_
that comes to their attention that, again, is alarming in this _x000D_
regard._x000D_
    As you know, over the life of UNIFIL, I think it has had a _x000D_
constructive effect on events on the ground. I do not think the _x000D_
Government of Israel would support its perpetuation if it had _x000D_
not. But is it a panacea for Hezbollah? No, it is not. And, no, _x000D_
it will not be._x000D_
    I think that we have really pressed the U.N. to step up its _x000D_
reporting and to sound the alarm and to shine the spotlight and _x000D_
to do the things that it can do. But in terms of armed _x000D_
confrontation with Hezbollah, that is not something UNIFIL is _x000D_
perusing._x000D_
    We are also trying to enhance the capabilities of troops _x000D_
who comprise UNIFIL, which is one of the stronger missions, _x000D_
because of the European presence. And we are hopeful, again, _x000D_
that the peacekeeping summit that the President chaired will _x000D_
give us a broader pool of troops to draw from, so as to make _x000D_
sure that that mission is right-sized."
2923762,2923761,2923763,19198,2,"    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would _x000D_
just say that no consequences is a green light to violations. _x000D_
And that is what I see us doing."
2923763,2923762,2923764,19198,2,"    [Presiding] Thank you._x000D_
    Before I turn to Senator Markey, while Senator Menendez is _x000D_
here, it is true that it is highly unlikely that the U.N. _x000D_
Security Council will take any actions relative to the _x000D_
violations of UNSCR 1929. Is that correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Again, we have already taken action."
2923764,2923763,2923765,19198,2,"    The answer is yes._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We have already taken action."
2923765,2923764,2923766,19198,2,"    But----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We have brought the issue to the _x000D_
Council. This is what we did----"
2923766,2923765,2923767,19198,2,"    But I am talking about as far as sanctions, _x000D_
penalties._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I would not assess that----"
2923767,2923766,2923768,19198,2,"    It is not likely that Russia or China will go _x000D_
along with----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I share your assessment on Russia and _x000D_
China."
2923768,2923767,2923769,19198,2,"    Okay, so let me just say this._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes."
2923769,2923768,2923770,19198,2,"    When you say that it is untrue what I said, _x000D_
relative to----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. That the administration was being more _x000D_
permissive in terms of sanctions violations. That was what I _x000D_
heard you say."
2923770,2923769,2923771,19198,2,"    Well, we will see. Nothing has happened yet._x000D_
    What I said was that the leverage shifts to Iran. They are _x000D_
at breakneck speed dismantling so that they get the sanctions _x000D_
relief they are after, which we would expect. Now people _x000D_
believe that in January or February, they will get all of the _x000D_
sanctions relief they are after._x000D_
    And for you to say that snapback is a real tool when it is _x000D_
contingent upon the countries that are participating _x000D_
implementing back those sanctions, and we have countries like _x000D_
Russia and China, which probably, likely, we know, are not _x000D_
going to push back against this issue._x000D_
    If there are incremental violations, all of the leverage is _x000D_
with Iran. That is a fact. It is not incorrect. It is with Iran _x000D_
because there is no way that this administration is going to _x000D_
consider challenging an incremental violation because they know _x000D_
all Iran has to do is step out. And they know that Russia and _x000D_
China and, candidly, probably our Western friends in Europe are _x000D_
not really going to force them to comply._x000D_
    So it is a true statement, not an untrue statement, that _x000D_
the leverage ends up with Iran because they have what they _x000D_
want. We have given it up, and we have partners at the U.N. _x000D_
Security Council that are not going to cooperate with us._x000D_
    Senator Markey?"
2923771,2923770,2923772,19198,2,"    Let me just interject for one second. I _x000D_
apologize to Senator Markey._x000D_
    I think a lot of us share that frustration. I would just _x000D_
urge us to work with our European allies on the timing of a _x000D_
response to the violation of the ballistic missiles._x000D_
    We all share the frustration that there is unlikely to be _x000D_
sanction action by the Security Council, but if we demonstrate _x000D_
action with our European partners, particularly in the P5, I _x000D_
think it would be a signal to Iran that these types of _x000D_
activities are not going to go unchallenged._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Senator Markey, would you mind if I just _x000D_
respond very briefly? I am so sorry._x000D_
    But I want to underscore that when we went to the council _x000D_
once we confirmed the violation on October 10, we did so with _x000D_
the United Kingdom, with France, and with Germany. And I think _x000D_
doing something like that irrespective of what further tangible _x000D_
outcome we were able to secure from the council is going to be _x000D_
very important in perhaps even broadening that._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, the one thing I feel compelled to say is that _x000D_
when you say they are going with breakneck speed to dismantle, _x000D_
it is very important to remember that that is a good thing. _x000D_
That is what we want, that breakneck speed, the dismantlement._x000D_
    So understanding again that there is pay for performance as _x000D_
part of the deal, that is the way that we have incentivized _x000D_
them moving forward and allowing the inspectors in._x000D_
    But sometimes in the way that this is discussed, you would _x000D_
think that that is not a good thing. That is a good thing. That _x000D_
is the point of the deal, to get them to dismantle their _x000D_
program."
2923772,2923771,2923773,19198,2,"    No, I understand that. I understand they are _x000D_
dismantling antique centrifuges, and we are allowing them to _x000D_
continue development of IR-2s, IR-4s, IR-6s, IR-8s. I _x000D_
understand that._x000D_
    And look, again, I do not want to re-debate the agreement. _x000D_
What I think we are focused on right now is that the _x000D_
international community knows that they violated UNSCR 1929, _x000D_
and in essence, they are violating the spirit of JPOA, where _x000D_
they are called upon not to do this. And we all know that the _x000D_
U.N. Security Council is not going to take action._x000D_
    That is what is important to us, because we believe that _x000D_
after they get the sanctions relief, after they dismantle these _x000D_
antiques that they are using right now, these IR-1s, that they _x000D_
are going to push the envelope._x000D_
    And we believe that you and others there, by not taking _x000D_
even bilateral action yet, are helping create an air of _x000D_
permissiveness._x000D_
    Even though we like you and respect you, we have a policy _x000D_
difference here. This is not directed at you. It is directed at _x000D_
the U.N. Security Council._x000D_
    Senator Markey?"
2923773,2923772,2923774,19198,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much._x000D_
    Thank you for all your great work, Ambassador. I know it is _x000D_
global and complex, but you just serve our country so well. _x000D_
Thank you._x000D_
    Could we come back, if we could for a second, to Syria? _x000D_
When I look at Assad, when I look at all of his supporters _x000D_
inside of the country, he has upwards of 30 percent of the army _x000D_
as Sunni soldiers who will not be viewed well when there is a _x000D_
peace agreement by the other Sunni soldiers that have been _x000D_
trying to depose Assad for all these years--similarly, the _x000D_
Alawite soldiers who are fighting for him._x000D_
    So they will be looking for protection, if there is a peace _x000D_
agreement. And I think Secretary Kerry and his entire team are _x000D_
doing a great job in moving us toward that. But there will have _x000D_
to be protection for these people to avoid--and I think they _x000D_
would be foolish not to anticipate this--what happened in Iraq, _x000D_
what happened in Libya, what happened in Egypt._x000D_
    So they are going to be looking for protection, and that _x000D_
kind of looks to the U.N. It looks to these blue-helmeted _x000D_
soldiers to come in and to give some level of guarantee that _x000D_
there will protection for them if they lay down their guns._x000D_
    Otherwise, I do not see a resolution of it. I just see a _x000D_
protracted war where no matter how hard you try to negotiate a _x000D_
peaceful settlement, you just wind up with an ever-continuing _x000D_
conflict._x000D_
    So could you talk about that a little bit and what role _x000D_
U.N. peacekeepers could play in a post-peace agreement, _x000D_
understanding that we are far from that, but just looking at, _x000D_
anticipating, a potential role for the U.N. or some other _x000D_
multinational force to move in and to give some guarantees?_x000D_
    Otherwise, I do not think Assad is ever leaving. You just _x000D_
look at it from a perspective of human nature and looking at _x000D_
what has happened in all these other countries, they will be _x000D_
dead. They will be killed. I mean, the revenge motivation is _x000D_
just going to be so high, given the tragedy that has affected _x000D_
these other families. And then we have yet another cycle that _x000D_
we have participated in._x000D_
    So how could the U.N. or another multinational force play a _x000D_
constructive role?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, there is no shortage of very _x000D_
complex dimensions to imagining a political settlement for _x000D_
Syria. But you put your finger on I think one the hardest _x000D_
issues of all, which would be any notional reintegration of _x000D_
Syrian moderate opposition forces with Syrian Government _x000D_
troops, whether the air force, which have been involved in _x000D_
barrel-bombing and chemical weapons use, or the infantry. I _x000D_
mean, it is going to be extremely difficult. And as you say, we _x000D_
are not at this point of the discussions._x000D_
    But in order for there to be an agreement on a political _x000D_
transition by mutual consent, which is the catchphrase from _x000D_
Geneva and is the operative principle for Vienna, that is going _x000D_
to be one of the questions that both sides are asking, because _x000D_
it cuts in the other direction as well. When moderate _x000D_
opposition forces go back to their home communities from which _x000D_
they have been purged, what happens to them if the forces in _x000D_
control remain, in large, government forces?_x000D_
    So where that confidence-building comes from, who the _x000D_
guarantors are of any kind of reintegration--and this gets back _x000D_
to Senator Cardin's question earlier--what the accountability _x000D_
mechanism is whereby there can be some healing or truth telling _x000D_
and punishment for those who committed the worst violations, _x000D_
all of those modalities have to be worked through."
2923774,2923773,2923775,19198,2,"    On both sides._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. On both sides, again, yes, absolutely._x000D_
    Now in terms of the near term, we have ISIL with a very _x000D_
extensive presence in Syria that is shrinking but nonetheless _x000D_
would be a significant consideration for any outside country _x000D_
thinking about deploying troops to Syria. We have al Qaeda's _x000D_
affiliate al-Nusra as well. Part of what is being worked _x000D_
through in Vienna, as you know, are definitions of who is a _x000D_
terrorist and who is not, so that there can be, at a strategic _x000D_
level at least, an idea that everybody can go against these _x000D_
forces together._x000D_
    But I think what you would need, if one was going with a _x000D_
troop presence from the outside, would you would have to make a _x000D_
judgment that a troop presence would do more good than harm, _x000D_
that it would invite and create more confidence. To have that _x000D_
confidence, those Alawites and Sunni soldiers on the government _x000D_
side and then Sunni moderates on the other side are going to _x000D_
have to believe that those troops are going to protect them, if _x000D_
they get attacked._x000D_
    If you look at U.N. peacekeeping missions as the first part _x000D_
of the hearing, that is not always the case around the world, _x000D_
right? Some troop contributors, that is not a role they play _x000D_
eagerly, even if that is part of the mandate._x000D_
    So then you could look at a regional force or a green-_x000D_
hatted force of some kind. You would still ask that question: _x000D_
Are troop contributors ready to invest themselves in enforcing _x000D_
this agreement? Is that something that some of our allies would _x000D_
be a part of?_x000D_
    And the only caution I would give in terms of a regional _x000D_
force, which is something I think that is being looked at--_x000D_
again, all the costs and benefits of all of these permutations _x000D_
have to be thought through. On the one hand, you would have the _x000D_
language. You would have the cultural affinities. But in the _x000D_
case of many of the regional players, they have been _x000D_
stakeholders in this conflict, so the idea is that they would _x000D_
then be seen as impartial._x000D_
    So finding a confidence-building mechanism that does not _x000D_
run afoul of being seen to be a party to the conflict, and _x000D_
where they would be willing to put their troops in harm's way _x000D_
on behalf of this agreement, is going to be one of the _x000D_
challenges we have to think through if the parties deem an _x000D_
outside force a necessary part of this political agreement."
2923775,2923774,2923776,19198,2,"    I do not see how you can avoid it. I just _x000D_
think that the recrimination coefficient is going to be _x000D_
historically high. The carnage has just been so great on both _x000D_
sides. And the bitterness, the acrimony will not settle out for _x000D_
decades. And we need some mechanism as an intervention that _x000D_
allows for a period of reconciliation, of healing._x000D_
    And I think in the absence of a very well thought out plan _x000D_
that is put together, and I think it should be put together _x000D_
sooner rather than later just a concept that could move in to _x000D_
assuage the concerns that all parties are going to have, that _x000D_
the removal of Assad does not ultimately lead to a repetition _x000D_
syndrome breaking out inside of the country in yet a different _x000D_
cycle that seeks to extract a revenge against those with whom _x000D_
they have grievances._x000D_
    So I just think the sooner we kind of think that through _x000D_
and what we are going to put in there, I think the better the _x000D_
conversations that we can have to give some assurances to the _x000D_
more responsible parties who might want to end this war that _x000D_
the death toll is not just going to continue to mount._x000D_
    So removing Assad is just one step. I think that it has to _x000D_
be accompanied by a set of guarantees that it is just not going _x000D_
to be mass carnage afterward._x000D_
    But I think I feel very good knowing that you are there and _x000D_
Secretary Kerry is there and thinking all these issues through. _x000D_
Thank you so much."
2923776,2923775,2923777,19198,2,"    Well, thank you for being with us. I think _x000D_
you can see that that we are getting close to the end here._x000D_
    I do want to chase just for a moment, if I could, the _x000D_
conversation you had with Senator Kaine._x000D_
    Do your colleagues at the United Nations think that somehow _x000D_
Congress and the American people do not want to defeat ISIS?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I do not think they would have that _x000D_
impression. My response was that they are puzzled as to why we _x000D_
cannot come up with an authorization here together----"
2923777,2923776,2923778,19198,2,"    And are they puzzled by the fact that the _x000D_
administration has told us over and over and over again here at _x000D_
this committee--Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, the White _x000D_
House sending over notes--that they have all the authorities _x000D_
they need to continue the fight against terrorism that was _x000D_
authorized in 2001? Is that confusing to them?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I think, again, I was not speaking----"
2923778,2923777,2923779,19198,2,"    That is your----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. If I may, I was not speaking to the _x000D_
legal authorities question. I do not think anybody questions _x000D_
whether or not the United States has the authority to carry out _x000D_
the campaign that we are carrying out._x000D_
    I think the question is, as a political symbol and as _x000D_
reinforcement of the effort that we are making, that there _x000D_
should be an ability to get consensus here."
2923779,2923778,2923780,19198,2,"    Well, there is consensus. I mean, the _x000D_
President has the authority----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I am sorry. My response was on an AUMF, _x000D_
consensus on an AUMF."
2923780,2923779,2923781,19198,2,"    It is a little game that is being played. It _x000D_
is difficult for me to understand. I mean, on one hand, witness _x000D_
after witness after witness comes up here and tells us they _x000D_
have all the authorities they need. And then people like you _x000D_
and others come up and talk about how it would be nice._x000D_
    I guess I do not get it. I voted for an authorization in _x000D_
2013. I helped craft it to go against Assad. And we turned away _x000D_
from that._x000D_
    So certainly, this committee is willing to take up tough _x000D_
issues when a declaration of war is occurring._x000D_
    And has the President declared war on ISIS? Has he declared _x000D_
war on ISIS? Has he laid out a strategy publicly to defeat _x000D_
ISIS?_x000D_
    So I just want to say, I am sorry this cutesy thing that _x000D_
has been occurring recently, especially over the last 2 weeks. _x000D_
I am having difficulty understanding when I agree with the _x000D_
administration. They have every authority that they need to _x000D_
defeat and destroy ISIS._x000D_
    So I do not know what is up. Maybe the President is _x000D_
receiving criticism, and he is trying to deflect that to _x000D_
Congress somehow. I do not know what is occurring._x000D_
    But all I can say with you, I am in full agreement with the _x000D_
administration that the 2001 authorization, while certainly on _x000D_
the edges, gives them the authority to do everything they could _x000D_
possibly want to do to destroy ISIS. And I believe that _x000D_
everyone in the world, everyone in the world, understands that _x000D_
Congress wants to see that happen._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Let me be clear. The President has _x000D_
himself, as you know, made clear that he has the authority to _x000D_
prosecute this campaign effectively. I was responding to _x000D_
Senator Kaine's comment that a number of the other countries in _x000D_
the coalition have gone through a domestic legislative process _x000D_
of----"
2923781,2923780,2923782,19198,2,"    They did not have the authorities to do what _x000D_
they were doing. They did not have the authorities. Is that _x000D_
correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I would have to go case by case, and I _x000D_
am not familiar with the domestic legal machinations in these _x000D_
countries."
2923782,2923781,2923783,19198,2,"    Well, certainly, Great Britain's or U.K.'s _x000D_
unwillingness----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes, I think in parliamentary systems, _x000D_
they need to go through the exercise that they have gone _x000D_
through._x000D_
    I think this is a reason though that the question is a _x000D_
little bit more in the air than it has been over the last 6 _x000D_
months up in New York."
2923783,2923782,2923784,19198,2,"    I think it is in the air for----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. But the President has said he has the _x000D_
authorities he needs. There is no resurrecting or surfacing _x000D_
this issue for any other reason."
2923784,2923783,2923785,19198,2,"    So you agree 100 percent that the President _x000D_
has the authority._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Absolutely."
2923785,2923784,2923786,19198,2,"    Has the President declared war on ISIS, by _x000D_
the way?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I believe he has said we are going to _x000D_
defeat and destroy ISIS, ISIL."
2923786,2923785,2923787,19198,2,"    Look, we thank you for being here today and _x000D_
certainly respect the job that you have. You are very bright _x000D_
and intelligent. Sometimes I take issue with you when I feel _x000D_
like you are carrying too much the administration's line. But I _x000D_
understand sometimes you feel compelled to do so._x000D_
    I thank you for being here, and we wish you well as you _x000D_
take demonstrative action against UNSCR 1929 being violated _x000D_
over the next week or so. Thank you._x000D_
    So our next panel will consist of two more outstanding _x000D_
witnesses. The first witness is the Honorable John Negroponte, _x000D_
vice chairman of McLarty and Associates and former United _x000D_
States Permanent Representative to the U.S. Mission to the _x000D_
United Nations, the same job our former witness is occupying._x000D_
    Our second witness will be Dr. Bruce Jones, vice president _x000D_
of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institute._x000D_
    Again, we thank Ambassador Power for being here. Both of _x000D_
you have witnessed what just happened. We hope you can _x000D_
summarize your thoughts in about 5 minutes. And we look forward _x000D_
to questions._x000D_
    Again, thank you for being here._x000D_
    John, why don't you start?_x000D_
_x000D_
   STATEMENT OF HON."
2923787,2923786,2923788,19198,3,"    Thank you so much._x000D_
    Dr. Jones?_x000D_
_x000D_
  STATEMENT OF DR."
2923788,2923787,2923789,19198,4,"    Well, thank you both. I know we got off on a _x000D_
lot of different topics in the last panel that were a little _x000D_
different than the main subject, but it is rare we have the _x000D_
opportunity to talk to the Ambassador._x000D_
    We thank you both. We know you are both friends. And _x000D_
obviously, with just Ben and I here, even though this will all _x000D_
be part of the record, which is appreciated, this is more of a _x000D_
conversation._x000D_
    You both have experienced the frustration of seeing _x000D_
peacekeeping operations where people were being abused and _x000D_
brutalized, and yet the caveats that existed kept peacekeepers _x000D_
from really being able to intervene. So we have moved in a more _x000D_
forward manner, which from my standpoint is welcomed as we have _x000D_
seen helpless people be brutalized in certain areas._x000D_
    What are, though, some of the challenges that, from your _x000D_
perspective, we most need to think about relative to that? I _x000D_
mean, in essence, it is an extension in some cases of actually _x000D_
carrying out semi-kinetic activities, right? So what are some _x000D_
of the things that we as a body ought to be thinking about as _x000D_
we progress down that path?"
2923789,2923788,2923790,19198,4,"    Dr. Jones, you mentioned that you do not _x000D_
think it is appropriate for the U.S. to have ground troops, if _x000D_
you will, involved. As it relates to our NATO efforts, we _x000D_
obviously have everything involved, money, equipment, _x000D_
personnel. Again, we are the provider of security services. _x000D_
Unfortunately, most of the members of NATO are consumers of _x000D_
security services._x000D_
    Here, we are the largest provider of monetary resources, _x000D_
and, as I understand it, we have committed 42 officers to be _x000D_
part of peacekeeping._x000D_
    But just for the record, could you tease out why it is you _x000D_
said what you just said? You say we should not be involved with _x000D_
ground troops because?"
2923790,2923789,2923791,19198,4,"    It is generally the same approach, as has _x000D_
been discussed by most, and that is in Syria we would like to _x000D_
have Arab faces on the ground more predominantly than Western _x000D_
faces, right? It just helps ensure that there is a more _x000D_
cohesive nature, if you will, relative to what is happening on _x000D_
the ground._x000D_
    Typically, we have had a policy, have we not, that U.S. _x000D_
troops are not going to be commanded by people other than U.S. _x000D_
officers, too? Is that correct?"
2923791,2923790,2923792,19198,4,"    Ambassador, you have had this role. You have _x000D_
been at the United Nations. Senator Cardin, which I appreciate _x000D_
deeply, raised the issue of just our payments. We have 22 _x000D_
percent of the world's gross domestic product and yet we _x000D_
contribute 28.5 percent of the budget here._x000D_
    Our other ``associates,'' if you will, at the United _x000D_
Nations obviously are not doing their part, otherwise our _x000D_
amount would not be 28.5 percent._x000D_
    We find this same to be the case--I have referred to it now _x000D_
three times--at NATO. It is where we desire for things to _x000D_
happen, it seems more so than others, and, therefore, we end up _x000D_
being financially exposed more than others._x000D_
    You have been in this role. Tell us from your perspective _x000D_
what we as a country can do to seek equilibrium and to cause _x000D_
other countries to play their appropriate roles."
2923792,2923791,2923793,19198,4,    Senator Cardin?
2923793,2923792,2923794,19198,4,"    Mr. Ambassador, as you were describing the _x000D_
U.N. budget process, I thought you were describing the U.S. _x000D_
budget process. [Laughter.]"
2923794,2923793,2923795,19198,4,"    Dr. Jones, thank you very much for your _x000D_
service. And you come here with a great deal of expertise on _x000D_
the United Nations, having worked as adviser to Secretary _x000D_
General._x000D_
    Ambassador Negroponte, you served in that position as _x000D_
Ambassador, and you have served in so many other positions of _x000D_
foreign policy._x000D_
    I want to follow up on the reform issues, and I will tell _x000D_
you why._x000D_
    But first, let me suggest to the chairman, your suggestion _x000D_
on training is a very important suggestion. I serve on the _x000D_
Board of Visitors of the U.S. Naval Academy, and I see _x000D_
firsthand the availability of training at the U.S. Naval _x000D_
Academy for some of our allied countries. We do train at our _x000D_
service academies foreign students._x000D_
    I think an arrangement with the United Nations in regards _x000D_
to their peacekeeping command may very well be a viable option _x000D_
to get greater capacity. And I would ask our staff to take a _x000D_
look at that, to see whether we can look at how our service _x000D_
academies could assist in this regard._x000D_
    It also helps us, because having a more diversified student _x000D_
body at our academies prepares us for the global missions that _x000D_
our military command needs to be aware of._x000D_
    So I thought that was a very good suggestion, and I would _x000D_
ask if our staffs could perhaps follow up on that and see _x000D_
whether that is a viable option._x000D_
    But I want to talk about the scale of assessments and the _x000D_
how these numbers come about. But I put it in context of a _x000D_
Senator who strongly supports the United Nations and its _x000D_
mission and its budget._x000D_
    But if we were to put it a U.N. reform bill on the floor of _x000D_
the United States Senate, the type of amendments that would be _x000D_
offered and the types of potential restrictions on U.S. _x000D_
participation in the United Nations, getting a majority vote, _x000D_
perhaps even a 60-vote threshold, is real. The reason for that _x000D_
is because of the lack of transparency in the United Nations _x000D_
and the illogical way that they go about their budgeting._x000D_
    We talk about burden-sharing, and we recognize that it is _x000D_
disproportionate, that the U.S. taxpayers have been asked to _x000D_
take on a much stronger commitment than the developed _x000D_
countries, those who have the capacity to do a lot more. It is _x000D_
true in NATO. It is true in our coalitions. It is true in _x000D_
individual participation globally. And it is certainly true in _x000D_
the United Nations._x000D_
    So I understand that we are getting a good value for our _x000D_
contributions to the U.N. I never doubt that. I agree with you _x000D_
completely. And the peacekeeping missions are critically _x000D_
important to the U.S._x000D_
    But it seems to me that we have not been as effective as we _x000D_
need to in the transparency and reform within the United _x000D_
Nations process. And if we do not deal with it in a way that is _x000D_
understandable to the U.S. political system, then there could _x000D_
be negative consequences to the U.S. participation at the _x000D_
United Nations._x000D_
    So it is for that reason that I cannot justify a 22 percent _x000D_
budget allocation and then 28.5 percent on peacekeeping, _x000D_
particularly in light of all the other commitments that U.S. _x000D_
taxpayers are making to international security issues. I would _x000D_
just like to get your advice as to the most effective way for _x000D_
this Senator and for the Congress to weigh in, in a _x000D_
constructive way, so that we can get the type of reforms we _x000D_
need in the United Nations."
2923795,2923794,2923796,19198,4,"    It is my understanding that the difference _x000D_
between 22 percent and 28 percent is not our share in the _x000D_
global economy. It is justified by our seat on the Security _x000D_
Council, which many of us interpret it is to bust the 22 _x000D_
percent cap."
2923796,2923795,2923797,19198,4,"    Because we have assumed greater burdens, we _x000D_
have even greater burdens."
2923797,2923796,2923798,19198,4,"    That is an interesting way of looking at _x000D_
it._x000D_
    Let me ask one last question, if I might._x000D_
    Ambassador Power was pretty firm and optimistic about the _x000D_
September 28 meeting of the countries that are contributing _x000D_
resources to the U.N. peacekeeping. The commitments, she _x000D_
continues to state, are just that--commitments. They have not _x000D_
been delivered yet._x000D_
    Have you had a chance to review the September 28 results? _x000D_
And are you optimistic that, in fact, this will have greater _x000D_
participation by the countries that are capable of doing more? _x000D_
What is your prognosis on this?"
2923798,2923797,2923799,19198,4,    Thank you. Thank you both for your service.
2923799,2923798,2923800,19198,4,"    Thank you._x000D_
    One of the great privileges that we have around here is the _x000D_
access to people like you who are so respected and have the _x000D_
ability to share wisdom with us and experiences. We know that _x000D_
every day when we come to work, so we want to thank you for _x000D_
your continued involvement in issues of importance to our _x000D_
country. Thank you for being here today._x000D_
    As you will see, a lot of our members make themselves _x000D_
present by asking questions later. So without objection, first _x000D_
of all, the record will be open until the close of business _x000D_
Friday. But if you could respond in a fairly timely manner, _x000D_
that would also be appreciated."
2923800,2923799,2923801,19198,4,"    We thank you for your service to our country, _x000D_
and we thank you for being here today._x000D_
    And with that, the meeting is adjourned."
2923801,2923800,2923802,19199,1,"    I call this meeting of the Foreign Relations _x000D_
Committee to order, and I want to thank General Allen for being _x000D_
here. I know he has a hard stop today at 3:30, and that he has _x000D_
meetings with CENTCOM later that he is traveling to. But I want _x000D_
to thank him for being here, and I will properly introduce him _x000D_
in just a moment._x000D_
    The President has sent forward a request for the _x000D_
authorization for the use of military force. Because of the _x000D_
nature and the way that this happened in that the conflict has _x000D_
been ongoing for about 6 months now, I think one of the things _x000D_
that most people here are concerned about is that there is a _x000D_
level of confidence in what we are doing, and that it is going _x000D_
to achieve the stated goals that the President has laid out. _x000D_
And I do not know of anybody more equipped to come before us _x000D_
today than General Allen, who has served our country with great _x000D_
distinction._x000D_
    I think many people feel decently well about what is _x000D_
happening in Iraq. I think there are a lot of questions _x000D_
relative to Syria. My sense is today you will have a number of _x000D_
questions regarding that. And we hope that what you will do, _x000D_
General Allen, is give us an honest assessment as to the end _x000D_
state that we would like to see happen in Iraq and Syria when _x000D_
we complete the activities that we are involved in, and _x000D_
understand the political and military strategy that we have _x000D_
underway, and to give us a little sense of timeframe relative _x000D_
to the various activities that are necessary._x000D_
    I was just in Iraq last week in both Baghdad and Erbil with _x000D_
our Kurdish friends, and then over in Ankara with our Turkish _x000D_
friends, and I will say that the Shia militias are everywhere _x000D_
in Iraq, as people know. General Suleimani, who is head of the _x000D_
Quds Force for Iran, has now become a celebrity in Iraq. And I _x000D_
have to say it feels very strange to be there knowing that much _x000D_
of the activity that we have underway, while it is necessary, _x000D_
is really to Iran's benefit. And I know there are a lot of _x000D_
concerns that after this activity is completed if we are _x000D_
successful with ISIS, which I know we will be, in essence, the _x000D_
next issue is going to be dealing with security of forces there _x000D_
with the Shia militias._x000D_
    I was happy to see that Turkey has gone ahead and signed an _x000D_
agreement, train and equip agreement. I am sure that is _x000D_
something that you have made happen, and thank you for that. At _x000D_
the same time, I know there are a lot of concerns right now _x000D_
about how we deal with Assad's barrel bombs as we train and _x000D_
equip these individuals. How do we protect them from the barrel _x000D_
bombs, which cause them to diminish in a greater number than _x000D_
they can be trained? And I am sure that you are going to talk _x000D_
about that._x000D_
    There is a lot of discussion, as you know, on the ground _x000D_
there about an air exclusion zone--I know you will have some _x000D_
questions about that--and just no-fly discussions. It may be _x000D_
taking place to draw Turkey more into what is happening in _x000D_
Syria itself, which I think most of it--most of us believe is _x000D_
very important._x000D_
    So as we--as I close, I just want to say we owe it to our _x000D_
nation as we consider this to know that the full range of _x000D_
America's elements of national power, diplomatic, economic, and _x000D_
military means are aligned in such a way to get to the _x000D_
administration's stated goals. Because of the nature of this _x000D_
decision, one, again, this being made after the fact, all of us _x000D_
need to have confidence that the administration is truly _x000D_
committed to achieving the stated goals that they have laid _x000D_
out. And I think your testimony here is going to be very _x000D_
valuable to us._x000D_
    And with that, I would like to turn to our distinguished _x000D_
ranking member, Senator Menendez, who has been a great partner _x000D_
on all of these issues."
2923802,2923801,2923803,19199,1,"    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you _x000D_
for calling the hearing for our work forward on this. And, _x000D_
General Allen, welcome back to the committee, and thank you for _x000D_
your distinguished service to our country in so many different _x000D_
ways, including your present position as a special envoy._x000D_
    Although this hearing is not focused on the _x000D_
administration's proposed authorization for the use of military _x000D_
force against ISIL, it is by nature an opportunity to probe the _x000D_
dynamics of our current anti-ISIL strategy that will inform our _x000D_
discussion of an AUMF, and specifically whether a strategy that _x000D_
relies on U.S. air power and logistics, intelligence, and _x000D_
training support, but not on U.S. troops on the ground, would _x000D_
be successful in achieving our ultimate goal to end the _x000D_
barbaric rampage of ISIL._x000D_
    There are those who believe that it is up to our local _x000D_
partners on the ground to ultimately take this war across the _x000D_
finish line. I have heard from others who believe that ISIL _x000D_
cannot be defeated without a significant U.S. ground _x000D_
commitment. So I would like to hear from you, General Allen, _x000D_
where you come down on what will be required to eradicate ISIL, _x000D_
given that we hear reports from Secretary Carter's meetings in _x000D_
Kuwait that while the anti-ISIL strategy does not require _x000D_
fundamental recalibration, our coalition partners can be doing _x000D_
more._x000D_
    My view personally is that the United States must help _x000D_
combat ISIL and restore stability to the region, and we must _x000D_
follow through on our commitments to our Arab partners. But _x000D_
large-scale U.S. ground forces at this time in this complex _x000D_
political and military atmosphere would at the end of the day _x000D_
decisively increase the prospect of losing a long war._x000D_
    Now, I appreciate and want to salute all the men and women _x000D_
who are waging a campaign against ISIL, particularly from the _x000D_
air, all of the airstrikes that have, according to your own _x000D_
testimony, inflicted significant damage. And those are _x000D_
promising, and we salute the men and women who do that. But our _x000D_
effectiveness in combating this threat I think cannot be _x000D_
measured only in the number of sorties flown or bombs dropped._x000D_
    So today's hearing is a welcome opportunity to step back _x000D_
and assess the big picture, the state of the coalition, what _x000D_
will it ultimately take to defeat ISIL, and what we know, I _x000D_
think, will be a multiyear effort that will take billions of _x000D_
dollars, significant military assets, and the painstaking _x000D_
patience of diplomacy matched to all of those efforts._x000D_
    We look forward to your insights, and we welcome you back _x000D_
to the committee."
2923803,2923802,2923804,19199,1,"    Our distinguished witness today is Gen. John _x000D_
Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition _x000D_
to Counter ISIS. General Allen is a retired U.S. Marine four-_x000D_
star general, former commander of ISAF and U.S. forces in _x000D_
Afghanistan. Upon his retirement from the Marine Corps, he was _x000D_
appointed as the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense on _x000D_
Middle East security. He is currently on a leave of absence _x000D_
from Brookings Institution, where he is codirector of the 21st _x000D_
Century Security and Intelligence Center._x000D_
    We thank you for your frankness. We thank you for your _x000D_
service to our country. We thank you for being here today. I _x000D_
know you are going to have an unusually long opening comment, _x000D_
which we appreciate, and then we will turn to questions._x000D_
_x000D_
       STATEMENT OF GEN. JOHN R. ALLEN, USMC (RETIRED), _x000D_
           SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR THE GLOBAL _x000D_
     COALITION TO COUNTER ISIL, U."
2923804,2923803,2923805,19199,2,"    We thank you for the testimony and for your _x000D_
great service to our country._x000D_
    Yesterday Senator Kerry testified that he felt like that _x000D_
today the administration already has, because of the 2001 AUMF _x000D_
and the 2002 AUMF, the authority to conduct the operations that _x000D_
are being conducted in Iraq and Syria. Do you agree with that _x000D_
assessment?"
2923805,2923804,2923806,19199,2,"    Okay. So it is an interesting place that we _x000D_
find ourselves where 6 months after conflicts have begun, a new _x000D_
AUMF is being offered. And I know that in order to pursue one _x000D_
properly through Congress, it is standard process to submit _x000D_
one, which I appreciate. But it is an interesting place that _x000D_
those authorities already exist._x000D_
    The train and equip program that you have been able to _x000D_
negotiate, many concerns have been raised about the fact that _x000D_
most of the free Syrian opposition initially was targeting _x000D_
Assad. That was the reason for their being. Now we are _x000D_
organizing these against ISIS, and my understanding is we are _x000D_
going against an entirely different recruitment group to do _x000D_
that. Are we finding that to be an easy recruitment process?"
2923806,2923805,2923807,19199,2,"    So my sense is there are, based on my _x000D_
experiences last week, there are larger groups of people that _x000D_
are willing to go against ISIS initially in this train and _x000D_
equip than some initially thought. Is that correct?"
2923807,2923806,2923808,19199,2,"    So let me ask you this question. One of the _x000D_
big moral dilemmas I think is that as we train and equip these _x000D_
folks, we know that Assad is, in fact, barrel bombing other _x000D_
members of the Free Syrian Army today. I know that is a loose _x000D_
description of who it is that is opposing him. But my _x000D_
understanding is there have been significant discussions with _x000D_
Turkey over an air exclusion zone in the northwestern Aleppo _x000D_
area and a no-fly zone along the border. And that has been the _x000D_
issue that has hindered them actually getting more involved in _x000D_
the conflict even though they are working with us more fully _x000D_
than they have in multiple areas, some of which I will not _x000D_
mention here. That has been the issue that has kept them from _x000D_
actually getting more involved._x000D_
    It is also my understanding that that decision, the _x000D_
decision to do that, is at the President's desk. It is at the _x000D_
White House, and he has not made a decision yet as to whether _x000D_
to engage. Can you update us on that or tell us the effect of _x000D_
that decision not being made on Turkey getting more involved in _x000D_
the conflict, and helping us with those ground operations you _x000D_
were talking about earlier?"
2923808,2923807,2923809,19199,2,"    But it is fair to say that there are some _x000D_
significant decisions that our government needs to make _x000D_
relative to those protections. And if they are made, could _x000D_
break a little bit of a logjam relative to greater involvement _x000D_
by Turkey. That would be a fair assessment. Is that correct?"
2923809,2923808,2923810,19199,2,    That is right.
2923810,2923809,2923811,19199,2,"    And one final question, and then I will stop _x000D_
and turn it over to Senator Menendez. In the event that we _x000D_
needed to protect those that we are training and equipping and _x000D_
other members of the Free Syrian Army, in the event we needed _x000D_
to protect them against Assad barrel bombing them, do you _x000D_
believe that is something that needs an additional authority _x000D_
other than what is now being requested?"
2923811,2923810,2923812,19199,2,"    You would want to make sure that we knew that _x000D_
that type of authorization was a part of anything we may do."
2923812,2923811,2923813,19199,2,    Senator Menendez.
2923813,2923812,2923814,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Allen, _x000D_
you are a retired U.S. Marine, four-star general. You were the _x000D_
former commander of NATO's International Security Assistance _x000D_
Force and the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan for about a year and a _x000D_
half. And then you became the senior advisor to the Secretary _x000D_
of Defense on Middle East security._x000D_
    You commanded during that period of time 150,000 U.S. and _x000D_
NATO Forces in Afghanistan during a critical period of the war. _x000D_
And I put that out there, one, in recognition of that service, _x000D_
and, two, in also the framework of my question. What does ``no _x000D_
enduring combat forces'' mean?"
2923814,2923813,2923815,19199,2,"    I appreciate a consultation. The problem _x000D_
is you referenced your answer in the context of emergencies, _x000D_
but ``no enduring offensive combat troops'' does not _x000D_
necessarily only apply to emergencies. If you send 20,000 _x000D_
troops there in there for 4 months, is that enduring?"
2923815,2923814,2923816,19199,2,    So it is neither time nor size.
2923816,2923815,2923817,19199,2,    Okay.
2923817,2923816,2923818,19199,2,"    And I think you have honestly stated the _x000D_
challenge that we have. Two weeks is one thing, 2 years is _x000D_
another, and this is the problem with the language as it _x000D_
exists. There is no clear defining element of the authorization _x000D_
given to the President in which hundreds, but then maybe tens _x000D_
of thousands of troops could be sent. They could be sent for _x000D_
long periods of time._x000D_
    That is a challenge. And so, how do we get our arms around _x000D_
that, you know. I think I can fairly speak for Democrats. We _x000D_
want to fight ISIL. We want to give the President the _x000D_
wherewithal to degrade and deter them. But we cannot provide a _x000D_
blank check to this and a future President because everything _x000D_
that is envisioned goes beyond this President. So I wanted to _x000D_
use your expertise to try to put my arms around it, and I see _x000D_
the challenge that we have._x000D_
    Let me ask you this. Following up on the chairman's _x000D_
questions, is it not basically true that unless we buy into _x000D_
something that is about getting rid of Assad, Turkey is really _x000D_
not going to engage here with us in the way we want them to?"
2923818,2923817,2923819,19199,2,"    Is it not true that Turkey at this point _x000D_
still is allowing foreign fighters to cross its borders into _x000D_
Syria?"
2923819,2923818,2923820,19199,2,"    One final question on Iran. Iran is in _x000D_
the midst of Iraq. It is in the midst of Syria. Do we share _x000D_
mutual goals with Iran?"
2923820,2923819,2923821,19199,2,"    Do you think the Iranians share that _x000D_
view?"
2923821,2923820,2923822,19199,2,"    Because they have very significant _x000D_
influence in Iraq."
2923822,2923821,2923823,19199,2,"    I am looking beyond, so if we think an _x000D_
accommodation to fight ISIL is good, the aftermath of that in _x000D_
Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere, in my view, is not so _x000D_
good. And so, sometimes we look at the short game versus the _x000D_
long one, and I am concerned about what the long one is."
2923823,2923822,2923824,19199,2,    Thank you.
2923824,2923823,2923825,19199,2,    Senator Johnson.
2923825,2923824,2923826,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Allen, _x000D_
thank you for your service. I did not envy your task. In your _x000D_
testimony you say that ISIS has lost half of its Iraq-based _x000D_
leadership. How do we know that?"
2923826,2923825,2923827,19199,2,"    You said that ISIS has lost half of its _x000D_
Iraq-based leadership. How do we know that? Do we have pretty _x000D_
good intelligence for that?"
2923827,2923826,2923828,19199,2,"    You also said that in the last 6 months we _x000D_
have amply demonstrated that ISIS is ``little more than a _x000D_
criminal gang and death cult, which now finds itself under _x000D_
increasing pressure, sending naive and gullible recruits to die _x000D_
by the hundreds.'' What is your evaluation of the accretion _x000D_
versus degradation ratio? How many people are coming into the _x000D_
battle, actually being drawn and recruited by what they see in _x000D_
ISIS versus the number of people who really are dying?"
2923828,2923827,2923829,19199,2,"    Is it positive or negative? Are more _x000D_
people joining the fight versus what we are able to degrade?"
2923829,2923828,2923830,19199,2,"    So that kind of leads me to my next _x000D_
question. Defeat sounds good, but can you describe what defeat _x000D_
looks like?"
2923830,2923829,2923831,19199,2,"    You mentioned the establishment of the _x000D_
caliphate. The article in The Atlantic really kind of laid out _x000D_
that that is a draw. That is a pull. That establishes certain _x000D_
benchmarks, a certain motivation for people being recruited. It _x000D_
relies on territorial gains or a hold onto territory. Is that _x000D_
part of defeat, to deny them all territory?"
2923831,2923830,2923832,19199,2,"    To destroy them so that the caliphate no _x000D_
longer exists? So we are talking about pretty much decimation, _x000D_
correct? That is what Secretary Kerry--that was the word he _x000D_
used, ``decimate.'' You know, a few people scattered maybe _x000D_
around the world--kind of like after Nazi Germany--but pretty _x000D_
well decimated. That is not exactly what I am hearing out of _x000D_
you."
2923832,2923831,2923833,19199,2,"    Define a ``small organization.'' Again, I _x000D_
am just trying to get some sense of what we mean by defeat. It _x000D_
sounds great, to deny them operational capabilities. Are we _x000D_
talking about taking 30,000 down to 500? Are we taking 30,000 _x000D_
down to 10,000 broken up into 10 different groups?"
2923833,2923832,2923834,19199,2,"    And I am out of time. Thank you, General."
2923834,2923833,2923835,19199,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Cardin."
2923835,2923834,2923836,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, General _x000D_
Allen, thank you very much for your continued service to our _x000D_
country. We appreciate that very much. These are extremely _x000D_
challenging times, and we are very proud of your leadership."
2923836,2923835,2923837,19199,2,"    You are urging us to be patient, that this _x000D_
is going to take some time in order to achieve our mission of _x000D_
not only degrading, but destroying and defeating ISIL. You _x000D_
believe, as I understand, that the authorizations previously _x000D_
passed by Congress give the administration the authorization _x000D_
necessary for use of force. But I also understand you support _x000D_
the President's request to Congress?"
2923837,2923836,2923838,19199,2,"    And, of course, the President's request to _x000D_
Congress is pretty specific on ISIL and expires in 3 years. It _x000D_
is clear that there may well be a need for a continued military _x000D_
U.S. presence beyond that 3 years."
2923838,2923837,2923839,19199,2,    And I think that is an honest assessment.
2923839,2923838,2923840,19199,2,"    And if I understand the reasoning behind _x000D_
their request is that the current administration recognizes it _x000D_
will be up to the next administration to come back to Congress _x000D_
to get the next Congress and the administration together on the _x000D_
continued commitment to fight terrorists and what use of force _x000D_
will be necessary."
2923840,2923839,2923841,19199,2,"    So my point is, why does that not also _x000D_
apply to 2001 authorization of force? Here we are talking about _x000D_
a threat that was identified last year that we are currently _x000D_
combating, recognizing that the campaign or use of force may _x000D_
well go beyond 3 years. But it is the prerogative of the next _x000D_
Congress and administration to define the authorizations that _x000D_
are needed._x000D_
    The 2001 authorization, which was passed against a known _x000D_
threat against the United States in Afghanistan, now is still _x000D_
being used to a threat such as ISIL. Would the same logic not _x000D_
apply that Congress should define the 2001 authorization _x000D_
contemporary with the current needs to go after al-Qaeda?"
2923841,2923840,2923842,19199,2,"    And I understand that, and it is limited to _x000D_
3 years."
2923842,2923841,2923843,19199,2,"    Would you agree that our success in Iraq in _x000D_
dealing with ISIL very much depends upon the Sunni tribes _x000D_
taking a leadership role in stopping the advancement of ISIL, _x000D_
that it is difficult for the Shiites, it is difficult for _x000D_
Western forces to be able to get the type of confidence in the _x000D_
community to withstand the recruitments of ISIL?"
2923843,2923842,2923844,19199,2,"    And what is your confidence in the _x000D_
Government of Iraq and Baghdad and its ability to work with the _x000D_
Sunni tribal leaders to give them that type confidence that _x000D_
their centralized government represents their interests and _x000D_
protects their interests?"
2923844,2923843,2923845,19199,2,"    Thank you, General. I really do appreciate _x000D_
all your service."
2923845,2923844,2923846,19199,2,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    Senator Paul."
2923846,2923845,2923847,19199,2,"    General Allen, thanks for your testimony. _x000D_
What percentage would you say is an estimate of how many of the _x000D_
officials in Iraqi are Sunni versus Shia?"
2923847,2923846,2923848,19199,2,"    The reason I ask is because it is sort of on _x000D_
the heels of what Senator Cardin is asking. Global Security _x000D_
reports basically somewhere between 80 to 90 percent of the _x000D_
official Iraqi Army being Shia. I think to have an enduring _x000D_
victory, there is some question from some of us whether or not _x000D_
you can have an enduring victory and occupy Mosul and be seen _x000D_
as a legitimate government if you have got an 80- to 90-percent _x000D_
Shia force. So I think that still is a significant political _x000D_
problem and a significant military problem as well._x000D_
    Of the chieftains that fought in the surge, just an _x000D_
estimate, what percentage are engaged on our side now fighting _x000D_
against ISIS, and what percentage are on the sidelines, and _x000D_
what percentage indifferent?"
2923848,2923847,2923849,19199,2,"    And the chieftains are no longer in the area? _x000D_
They have been driven out of the area, the ones that you have _x000D_
spoken----"
2923849,2923848,2923850,19199,2,"    With regard to arming the Kurds, there were _x000D_
reports a month or two ago that Germany wanted to send arms _x000D_
directly to them, but there were objections by our government _x000D_
saying everything had to go through Baghdad. Are arms from our _x000D_
allies forced to go through Baghdad to get to the Kurds?"
2923850,2923849,2923851,19199,2,"    Do you think this includes sufficient _x000D_
technology and long-range weaponry to meet their needs and _x000D_
their requests?"
2923851,2923850,2923852,19199,2,"    We are destroying or abandoning equipment in _x000D_
Afghanistan. Is there any possibility that any of that could be _x000D_
transported to the Kurds?"
2923852,2923851,2923853,19199,2,"    Thank you. With regard to ultimate victory _x000D_
with regard to trying to get Turkey involved, do you think _x000D_
there is any possibility of an agreement between the Turks and _x000D_
the Kurds, particularly the Turkish Kurds, to accept an _x000D_
agreement where there would be a Kurdish homeland not in _x000D_
Turkish territory that would encourage Turkey then to _x000D_
participate more heavily? And is anybody in the State _x000D_
Department trying to come to an accommodation between the Turks _x000D_
and the Kurds?"
2923853,2923852,2923854,19199,2,"    Take that message to them, too, please. Thank _x000D_
you."
2923854,2923853,2923855,19199,2,"    And one just quick followup to that. I think _x000D_
you might get more indigenous support from the Sunni people if _x000D_
you are leafleting the place as you are invading saying it is _x000D_
an invading Sunni force led by Sunni generals, and that were _x000D_
announced. I think our problem really was Mosul was being _x000D_
occupied by a Shiite force, and they did not stay long. Once _x000D_
push came to shove, they were pretty much gone. Thanks."
2923855,2923854,2923856,19199,2,    Senator Markey.
2923856,2923855,2923857,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Thank _x000D_
you, General, so much for your service._x000D_
    In the authorization for the use of military force text _x000D_
that the administration provided to this committee, it said _x000D_
that it would prohibit enduring ground forces. And this was _x000D_
meant to convey that large numbers of troops would not be on _x000D_
the ground for a long time, whatever that means. I voted for _x000D_
the 2001 resolution, and I am reminded that the U.S. combat _x000D_
operations in Afghanistan were dubbed ``Operation Enduring _x000D_
Freedom.''_x000D_
    We are now past 13 years in that enduring fight, and that _x000D_
resolution, of course, was also the basis for the justification _x000D_
of our actions in Somalia, in Yemen. And the administration is _x000D_
saying quite clearly that they oppose the repeal of that, and _x000D_
that the operations that are going on right now, in fact, are _x000D_
consistent with that 2001 resolution._x000D_
    Now, that causes great problems to me and, I think, to many _x000D_
members of the committee because even in the absence of the _x000D_
passage of a new AUMF, the administration is maintaining that _x000D_
they have the authority to continue as they have for 13 years _x000D_
under Operation Enduring Freedom. And so, that obviously is a _x000D_
problem for us because that sits there as an underlying _x000D_
authority for the next President, Democrat or Republican, who _x000D_
is sworn in on January 20, 2017. And most of us will be sitting _x000D_
here then as your successor is sitting here, and perhaps not _x000D_
with the same interpretation of the word ``enduring.''_x000D_
    So my questions then go to, is this going to open up a _x000D_
potential foreign open-ended war in the Middle East? Will it _x000D_
allow for unfettered deployment of ground troops? And _x000D_
ultimately, whether or not we are opening up Pandora's Box, _x000D_
especially in Syria. So my first question to you goes to _x000D_
President Assad and what the goal will be underneath this _x000D_
authorization in terms of the removal of President Assad, which _x000D_
has been historically an objective that the United States has _x000D_
said is important._x000D_
    So could you tell us what President Assad and his removal _x000D_
represents as one of the goals that exists in training 5,000 _x000D_
troops in Syria for the next 3 years in a row as the long-term _x000D_
objective after the defeat of al-Nusra and ISIS?"
2923857,2923856,2923858,19199,2,"    I appreciate that, but it just seems to me _x000D_
that that is a 10-year proposition, and if that is the case we _x000D_
should be talking about a 10-year period. We can finish Iraq _x000D_
perhaps over the next 3 years, but then in Syria it is a much _x000D_
longer process. And we should just understand what the long-_x000D_
term goal requires from us inside of Syria. And just saying _x000D_
Assad's name over and over again I think will just help us to _x000D_
focus on the ultimate objective that the Free Syrian Army is _x000D_
going to have in that country, and then what we are signing up _x000D_
for in terms of the long-term military effort inside of that _x000D_
country._x000D_
    And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to ask _x000D_
this one final question, which is, the basic tension that King _x000D_
Abdullah was talking about, which is that of the Americans _x000D_
providing help to fight the war, but not claiming credit so it _x000D_
does not look like a crusade inside of that region. Can you _x000D_
talk about that so that the people in the region do not view _x000D_
this as a U.S.-led coalition against ISIL, because ultimately _x000D_
that then comes back to haunt us. And that was the message that _x000D_
we are receiving from all the Middle East."
2923858,2923857,2923859,19199,2,"    I do not think people in that region view _x000D_
it that way right now. I think that has to be our goal, though. _x000D_
We just have to switch it so that it is not us, and I think _x000D_
Senator Paul is referring to that, that it has to be an _x000D_
indigenous Muslim-led effort, and I do not think that is the _x000D_
internal view._x000D_
    Thank you."
2923859,2923858,2923860,19199,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Isakson."
2923860,2923859,2923861,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Allen, _x000D_
thank you for your service to the country. I have followed you _x000D_
on TV closely the last couple of months, and I think you have _x000D_
done a great job."
2923861,2923860,2923862,19199,2,"    Am I correct, we are operating currently _x000D_
in the Middle East under the 2001 AUMF? Is that correct?"
2923862,2923861,2923863,19199,2,"    Would it be a fair statement to say the _x000D_
one the President has sent to us to consider is actually a _x000D_
limiting AUMF compared to the 2001 authorization?"
2923863,2923862,2923864,19199,2,"    But it is limiting in the authority the _x000D_
President would have primarily by the interpretation of the _x000D_
``enduring'' phrase. Is that correct?"
2923864,2923863,2923865,19199,2,"    Like Senator Markey, I voted for the 2001 _x000D_
authorization when I was here. It came on the heels of 9/11/_x000D_
2001. It was passed at a time when Americans had American flags _x000D_
on their windshields and their front doors, and American _x000D_
businesses had flags raised. And the patriotism in our country, _x000D_
because of the terrible attack against our country, was at an _x000D_
all-time high, at least in my lifetime, in my memory. Are we _x000D_
going to have to wait for that type of event again to happen to _x000D_
us before we use whatever it takes to destroy this evil, _x000D_
meaning ISIL and those like them?"
2923865,2923864,2923866,19199,2,"    In your printed statement, and I assume it _x000D_
is part of your remarks that you said verbally, you said, ``It _x000D_
will ultimately be the aggregate pressure of the coalition's _x000D_
activity over multiple mutual supporting lines of effort that _x000D_
will determine the campaign's success.''"
2923866,2923865,2923867,19199,2,"    What are those mutually supporting lines _x000D_
that you are referring to?"
2923867,2923866,2923868,19199,2,"    On that point and very briefly because my _x000D_
time will be up in about 45 seconds."
2923868,2923867,2923869,19199,2,"    Are we doing enough to counteract the use _x000D_
of social media and technology to communicate exactly what you _x000D_
are talking about that they are doing, because what you heard _x000D_
about in Southeast Asia and what I have heard from on some _x000D_
trips I have taken is the fear they will use social media and _x000D_
the modern communication mechanisms that we have today to _x000D_
spread their ideology and their fear around the world. Are we _x000D_
attacking that as much as we should?"
2923869,2923868,2923870,19199,2,    Thank you for your time and your service.
2923870,2923869,2923871,19199,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Boxer."
2923871,2923870,2923872,19199,2,"    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking _x000D_
Member Menendez. General, thank you so much for your dedication _x000D_
to this nation. I want to thank the President for the wisdom he _x000D_
showed in appointing you as the special envoy. I find your _x000D_
presentation to be very direct, no frills, just _x000D_
straightforward, and I appreciate it._x000D_
    Under Article 1, Section 8, Congress has the power to _x000D_
declare war. I know you agree with that, yes?"
2923872,2923871,2923873,19199,2,"    All right. So I hope you could then _x000D_
understand why we want to be very precise when we do that _x000D_
because we are sent here by a lot of people who have a lot of _x000D_
kids who serve in the military, and they are the fabric of our _x000D_
community, so we want to be careful. And I just want to say--I _x000D_
am not even going to ask you to expand on this ``enduring'' _x000D_
word because you have said it very clearly. Your definition of _x000D_
no enduring presence could mean a 2-week presence of combat _x000D_
boots on the ground, American boots on the ground, or a 2-year _x000D_
presence of American combat boots on the ground._x000D_
    And that answers the question the Democrats on this _x000D_
committee have been searching for--this definition--and I think _x000D_
what you have proven with your honesty here is there is no _x000D_
definition because it is in the eye of the beholder. When you _x000D_
say to me that if I vote for this there will be no enduring _x000D_
combat presence, and I am sending kids in my State there for 2 _x000D_
years, I would argue you have misinterpreted it. The _x000D_
Congressional Research Service says there is really no _x000D_
definition. And if I wanted to take an administration to court _x000D_
because as a Member of Congress, I said no enduring presence, _x000D_
CRS says I would not have a legal leg to stand on because there _x000D_
is no definition._x000D_
    So I just think it is very important the administration _x000D_
hear this once again. I mean, I know poor Secretary Kerry had _x000D_
to hear it over and over again from our side yesterday, but we _x000D_
are very uncomfortable with this language. And when Senator _x000D_
Menendez was chairman, he cobbled together a really good AUMF _x000D_
that united all of us on our side because he essentially said _x000D_
no combat troops with these exceptions, and he put in the kind _x000D_
of exceptions I think you would agree with: special forces _x000D_
operations, search and rescue, protecting personnel. And we _x000D_
would urge you to please go back and take a look at it. I just _x000D_
feel very strongly._x000D_
    Now, I want to ask you questions that have nothing to do _x000D_
with that because I think you and I would probably disagree on _x000D_
that subject. There is no point in going over it again. But I _x000D_
am very concerned about U.S. military support for the Kurds, _x000D_
and you answered the question in a very sure way, which is _x000D_
wonderful. You said, oh, no problem. However, the Kurds are not _x000D_
saying that._x000D_
    So I want to call to your attention a recent interview with _x000D_
Bloomberg View just 3 weeks ago. The head of the Kurdistan _x000D_
Regional Security Council expressed concerns about our _x000D_
commitment to the Kurds, and these are our boots on the ground. _x000D_
These are our boots on the ground. He said, ``We are starting _x000D_
to have doubts that there might be a political decision on what _x000D_
sort of equipment should be given to the Kurds . . . We are _x000D_
fighting on behalf of the rest of the world against this _x000D_
terrorist organization. We are putting our lives on the line. _x000D_
All we ask for is the sufficient equipment to protect these _x000D_
lives.''_x000D_
    So I need you to respond to that. Is that off base? What do _x000D_
you think about that? Do you take that comment seriously? Does _x000D_
it concern you?"
2923873,2923872,2923874,19199,2,"    My question was not about how good they are. _x000D_
We agree. They are saying they do not feel they have enough _x000D_
equipment. And I am just saying that while you are saying _x000D_
everything is rosy, they are complaining about it. And I just _x000D_
want to say--as one Senator, I cannot speak for anyone else--_x000D_
they are our boots on the ground, and we need to get them what _x000D_
they need. I know there is pressure from certain factions, but _x000D_
if they are going to be our boots on the ground, we have got to _x000D_
give them what they need. Thank you."
2923874,2923873,2923875,19199,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Rubio."
2923875,2923874,2923876,19199,2,"    Thank you. First of all, General, thank you _x000D_
for your service to our country and for your willingness to _x000D_
come back in and help with this new endeavor of great _x000D_
difficulty._x000D_
    I want to start out by just--I know we are not debating the _x000D_
authorization for use of force, but I do want to ask you _x000D_
because of your experience in these affairs in the past, it is _x000D_
my understanding from our review of the process that only two _x000D_
times in our history has Congress authorized the use of force _x000D_
with limitations, and both were United Nations peacekeeping _x000D_
missions. And so, the question that I would have now is, if our _x000D_
objective here is the defeat of ISIS, would it not be more _x000D_
prudent to authorize the Commander in Chief to move forward in _x000D_
that regard and allow him as Commander in Chief and any future _x000D_
Commander in Chief, whoever they may be, to decide what the _x000D_
appropriate strategy is moving forward to ultimately defeat _x000D_
them if that is the ultimate goal? What would be wrong with _x000D_
simply authorizing the President to defeat them?"
2923876,2923875,2923877,19199,2,"    No, I understand the strategy does. Just for _x000D_
purposes of an authorization from Congress, and I understand _x000D_
you have endorsed here today what the President wants to do, _x000D_
and I understand that perhaps that is what the President thinks _x000D_
he can get passed. But from a military point of view, would it _x000D_
not be more appropriate to simply authorize the President to do _x000D_
whatever it takes to defeat them?"
2923877,2923876,2923878,19199,2,"    Okay. My second question is, is it possible _x000D_
to defeat ISIS without them ultimately being defeated by _x000D_
someone on the ground? Someone is going to have to confront _x000D_
them eventually on the ground and defeat them there. If you can _x000D_
update us on efforts, and I have seen in the past some _x000D_
conversation among some of the regional countries, about the _x000D_
potential for a coalition of armed forces brought together--the _x000D_
Egyptians, the Turks, the Saudis, perhaps some of the kingdoms, _x000D_
Jordan, et cetera--who could provide a coalition of local _x000D_
forces who could play that role with significant U.S. _x000D_
assistance from the air, logistics, intelligence, et cetera. _x000D_
Has there been any progress made in that? Is that something _x000D_
that is actively being discussed with those nations?"
2923878,2923877,2923879,19199,2,"    Okay, I understand. So let me move on then _x000D_
to a separate topic, and that is the nature of this conflict. _x000D_
ISIS has already proven that they are going to move into--for a _x000D_
group to take root, and take hold, and actually be able to _x000D_
grow, they need ungoverned vacuum spaces that they can operate _x000D_
from. That is what perhaps has attracted them, for example, to _x000D_
Libya, not just the access to a port town, but the ability to _x000D_
operate uncontested in terms of another government, et cetera._x000D_
    It is important to understand that as this conflict _x000D_
continues, the possibility continues to grow that ISIS, in _x000D_
addition to being based in Syria and Iraq, will also look to _x000D_
other places where they can set up nodes operation. Libya is an _x000D_
example, but potentially training camps in Afghanistan. Any _x000D_
place where a vacuum opens up is an attractive and appealing _x000D_
place for them to move operations._x000D_
    And, therefore, as we put forth our strategy and as the _x000D_
Congress deliberates the authority it gives the President, that _x000D_
reality needs to be taken into account, correct?"
2923879,2923878,2923880,19199,2,"    Okay. My last question is about the nature _x000D_
of this conflict. You know, it has been talked about in the _x000D_
past that ISIS is some sort of, and they certainly are, a group _x000D_
of monsters that take on these acts of extreme violence, but _x000D_
these are not just random acts of extreme violence. This is a _x000D_
group who has a--their barbarism has a purpose. At the end of _x000D_
the day it is to purify, in their mind, that region to their _x000D_
form of Islam at the exclusion not just of non-Sunni Islam, but _x000D_
especially of non-Islamic populations._x000D_
    And in that realm, it is clear that the Christians and _x000D_
Yazidis, but recently we have seen Christians in particular, _x000D_
are in increased danger in this region, and they specifically _x000D_
target Christian populations for barbarity, both as a way to _x000D_
shock the world, but also as an effort to carry out their _x000D_
ultimate goal of, in their mind, ``purifying the region for _x000D_
Islam.'' Is there a not deep religious component to ISIS' _x000D_
strategy here? They are clearly as part of their effort trying _x000D_
to, again, using a term they would use, not one that I _x000D_
necessarily enjoy using, but ``cleanse the region'' of infidels _x000D_
and non-believers. And in that realm they have specifically _x000D_
targeted Christians for these sorts of atrocities that they are _x000D_
committing on now an ongoing basis as we saw yesterday again."
2923880,2923879,2923881,19199,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Kaine."
2923881,2923880,2923882,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, _x000D_
General Allen, for your service. I also want to thank you. You _x000D_
did very significant and important work with respect to trying _x000D_
to provide a security roadmap for the West Bank in the event of _x000D_
a peace deal between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Whether _x000D_
the leaders will do what their citizens want them to do and _x000D_
find such a deal is up to them. But it should not go unnoticed _x000D_
that you worked very, very hard on that, and you have put in _x000D_
place a template for security on the West Bank that is a very _x000D_
good thing in your work then, and in this context, really in _x000D_
the best traditions of American diplomacy. And I want to thank _x000D_
you for that."
2923882,2923881,2923883,19199,2,"    I want to make a comment about ends in the _x000D_
next two questions about means. I will pick up--Senator Johnson _x000D_
was quizzing you about what is defeat of ISIL. They are not a _x000D_
state. They say they are a state. They are not. They are not _x000D_
Islamic. They say they are. They are not. They are a mutation _x000D_
of Islam. And you even talk about defeating the idea of ISIL. I _x000D_
agree with you. They are just sort of an ideologically driven _x000D_
death cult._x000D_
    And so, as we grapple with the authorization, we really _x000D_
have to kind of grapple with this question of what does defeat _x000D_
look like. I am very practical about this. I want to protect _x000D_
Americans from ISIL. That is what I want to do. I want to _x000D_
protect Americans from ISIL, and I want to protect our allies _x000D_
who ask for our help. The defeat of the ideology, the death _x000D_
cult, you know, fantasy that they had, we could be chasing _x000D_
after a phantom by trying to do that. But I want to protect _x000D_
Americans, and I want to defend our allies who ask us for that._x000D_
    On the means side, a question about the ground troops _x000D_
issues. In the last three weeks, we have had meetings with two _x000D_
leaders from the region, King Abdullah and today the emir of _x000D_
Qatar. King Abdullah said this is our fight, not yours, and _x000D_
basically suggested that U.S. ground troops would not be a good _x000D_
idea. The emir of Qatar was actually even more straightforward _x000D_
about that today. He said I do not want American ground troops _x000D_
in. He actually--we did not suggest this to him. He brought up _x000D_
the notion that American ground troops may be a recruiting _x000D_
bonanza for ISIL, may change the notion of what the fight is. _x000D_
It is against the West, now we can really recruit people."
2923883,2923882,2923884,19199,2,"    And so, this is--you know, the ground troop _x000D_
thing is a wordsmithing issue, but the wordsmithing is _x000D_
subsidiary to the bigger issue, which is, you know, do we _x000D_
become an occupier? Do we become a recruiting tool for ISIL? _x000D_
King Abdullah's notion, you know. This terrorism is born and _x000D_
bred in the region. The United States did not create it. The _x000D_
region has got to stand up against it. If the region is not _x000D_
willing to stand up against it, there is virtually nothing that _x000D_
the United States can do, no matter how many resources we put _x000D_
into it, that will ultimately lead to a success. We cannot _x000D_
police the region that will not police itself._x000D_
    So I am kind of interested--forget about the wordsmithing. _x000D_
But when the leaders from the region say American ground troops _x000D_
are a bad idea, that is pretty--that is a powerful thought to _x000D_
those of us who are going to be voting on the authorization. _x000D_
How would you respond to that notion that the presence of any _x000D_
significant American ground troops changes the character of _x000D_
this and makes it the West against ISIL rather than a region _x000D_
needing to police its own extremism?"
2923884,2923883,2923885,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923885,2923884,2923886,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, _x000D_
General Allen, for your service, and your time, and your _x000D_
testimony today. And, again, we have to recognize that ISIS is _x000D_
a real threat to this country, and it requires a comprehensive _x000D_
strategy. And the commitment to their total destruction, I _x000D_
think, is the only thing that we can accept._x000D_
    I am glad the President has made the effort to forward the _x000D_
AUMF to Congress. Obviously I look forward to working with the _x000D_
President on the AUMF and this committee. In the letter that _x000D_
the President transmitted along with his language in the AUMF, _x000D_
he stated ``I have directed a comprehensive and sustained _x000D_
strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL. As part of this strategy, _x000D_
U.S. military forces are conducting a systematic campaign of _x000D_
airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.''_x000D_
    It is my understanding from the testimony that you have _x000D_
provided to us today that the United States has conducted about _x000D_
2,500 airstrikes. Is that correct?"
2923886,2923885,2923887,19199,2,"    And that is since Operation Inherent _x000D_
Resolve began on August 8. That is the timeframe of the 2,500?"
2923887,2923886,2923888,19199,2,"    Okay. And that is an average of 10 _x000D_
airstrikes a day. And so, the question I have is, is the pace _x000D_
of the operation sufficient to eradicate ISIL at this point?"
2923888,2923887,2923889,19199,2,"    And so, what besides the airstrikes then _x000D_
does the President's comprehensive and sustained strategy _x000D_
envision?"
2923889,2923888,2923890,19199,2,"    And the pace of operations which we _x000D_
discussed, with the passage of the AUMF, does that change at _x000D_
all?"
2923890,2923889,2923891,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923891,2923890,2923892,19199,2,    Senator Murphy.
2923892,2923891,2923893,19199,2,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. General _x000D_
Allen, thank you for your service. Thank you for your answers _x000D_
to the questions. I agree with Senator Boxer, they are _x000D_
straightforward and very helpful._x000D_
    I want to build on some questions from Senator Menendez and _x000D_
Senator Boxer on the authorizing language that we have before _x000D_
us. A lot of attention has been given to this phrase _x000D_
``enduring,'' not as much attention given to the juxtaposition _x000D_
that has now been created between what are offensive forces and _x000D_
what are defensive forces. Just so I understand this, you have _x000D_
talked about what the potential limitation is on size of force _x000D_
or duration of force under the enduring limitation. But so long _x000D_
as the presence of troops is considered defensive, there is no _x000D_
limitation in this authorization of military as to the number _x000D_
of troops or the duration of their time in the conflict area so _x000D_
long as they are considered defensive forces."
2923893,2923892,2923894,19199,2,"    I thought your answer to Senator Kaine's _x000D_
question was definitive in that you worry, as I know the _x000D_
President does, that a large-scale deployment of troops could _x000D_
become recruiting fodder for extremists as our presence in Iraq _x000D_
did over the 10 years. Do you think that that changes if our _x000D_
categorization of the forces are offensive or defensive, if we _x000D_
have 100,000 defensive troops? I do not think this President is _x000D_
going to authorize this, but this is a 3-year authorization, so _x000D_
the next President will get the chance to decide differently._x000D_
    Would it matter in terms of the ability for extremists to _x000D_
recruit as to whether our troops there were categorized as _x000D_
defensive versus offensive?"
2923894,2923893,2923895,19199,2,"    And do you have a sense, and I know you are _x000D_
not the sponsor of this legislation, but you were there, as to _x000D_
what the limits of that word ``defensive'' are? If our forces _x000D_
were there taking fire from an ISIL position and needed to _x000D_
advance on that position to eliminate it in order to defend our _x000D_
troops, I assume that that action in that time and space _x000D_
looking like an offensive action would still be considered _x000D_
defensive in the sense that it was necessary in order to defend _x000D_
our troops or coalition troops?"
2923895,2923894,2923896,19199,2,"    You are going to get stuck with a lot of _x000D_
hypothetical questions on these two phrases ``enduring'' and _x000D_
``defensive and offensive'' simply because we are stuck with _x000D_
them trying to figure them out._x000D_
    Just one last question if I could. Part of the success of _x000D_
the awakening was not just persuasion, but also the transfer of _x000D_
substantial resources to tribes. We, you know, effectively paid _x000D_
tribes in various ways in order to compensate them for their _x000D_
moving away from insurgencies and towards coalition forces. _x000D_
What did we learn from that experience, and how does it educate _x000D_
us as we try to move forward a strategy, once again, of trying _x000D_
to win over these forces?"
2923896,2923895,2923897,19199,2,    Yes.
2923897,2923896,2923898,19199,2,"    And so, does that include financial _x000D_
resources being transferred from the Iraqi Government to these _x000D_
tribes? Is that one of our recommendations to them?"
2923898,2923897,2923899,19199,2,    Thank you.
2923899,2923898,2923900,19199,2,"    Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. We _x000D_
have got a vote on, so I need to go quickly, so I will ask just _x000D_
a couple of questions quickly._x000D_
    How important do you think, and I apologize if you answered _x000D_
this before I came. How important do you think it is to have _x000D_
the AUMF?"
2923900,2923899,2923901,19199,2,    How important--go ahead.
2923901,2923900,2923902,19199,2,"    Well, thank you. That is certainly the case _x000D_
I have made that both our adversaries and our allies need to _x000D_
know that we speak with one voice here."
2923902,2923901,2923903,19199,2,"    Is there one that is more important than the _x000D_
other in that regard, or is it equally important for both of _x000D_
them to hear this message?"
2923903,2923902,2923904,19199,2,"    At what point is the impact of this AUMF _x000D_
diminished if we have language that is just--I mean, if we try _x000D_
to include every point of view and every nuance as opposed to _x000D_
something straightforward that we are in this to win. At what _x000D_
point does it become less important?"
2923904,2923903,2923905,19199,2,"    In other examples of AUMF, there has not _x000D_
been much change. We have basically done what the _x000D_
administration has asked for. And there have been some _x000D_
amendments in recent AUMFs, but by and large it has been rather _x000D_
straightforward language, rather short. I frankly think the _x000D_
language the administration put forward is a good start, and _x000D_
maybe amended some. But I would caution the committee and the _x000D_
Congress in general, the Senate and the House, from going too _x000D_
far to make it all things to everyone, and probably diminish _x000D_
the importance of it._x000D_
    But anyway, thank you for your service, and thank you for _x000D_
your testimony here."
2923905,2923904,2923906,19199,2,"    Thank you, Senator. Senator Kaine I know had _x000D_
a followup."
2923906,2923905,2923907,19199,2,"    General, I wanted to ask about one of the _x000D_
lines of effort that we are working on in a fairly significant _x000D_
way, and that is the humanitarian relief line. The United _x000D_
States is the most generous nation in the world in terms of _x000D_
humanitarian relief to refugees from Syria. But the problem is _x000D_
getting worse in some ways because of the closing of borders _x000D_
with Lebanon. There were too many refugees there. Jordan, _x000D_
probably the same thing. Turkey with border issues is probably _x000D_
less willing to just see waves and waves of Syrians coming _x000D_
over. And so, what are we doing in tandem with the London _x000D_
Eleven and other nations to try to deal with the humanitarian _x000D_
crisis of all of these displaced folks in Syria, whether they _x000D_
are being displaced because of Bashar al-Assad, ISIL, cholera _x000D_
outbreaks, weather, desperate poverty that they are being _x000D_
displaced? And I wonder about or humanitarian efforts in tandem _x000D_
with other nations."
2923907,2923906,2923908,19199,2,"    I know in response to a question from the _x000D_
chairman, you indicated the complexities of no-fly zones. I _x000D_
just would commend the idea of a humanitarian zone inside Syria _x000D_
probably on the border with Turkey or the border with Jordan, _x000D_
or maybe both, that would be justified by a U.N. Security _x000D_
Council resolutions already in place promoting cross-border _x000D_
delivery of humanitarian aid. That would be humanitarian zones _x000D_
for people who, whether they are fleeing Bashar al-Assad, ISIL, _x000D_
cholera, hunger, winter, whatever is, once the borders have _x000D_
been closed and they cannot transit across the borders, I hope _x000D_
we would contemplate some form of safe haven for the citizens _x000D_
who are suffering so badly in what I think most have testified _x000D_
is the worst refugee crisis since World War II."
2923908,2923907,2923909,19199,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923909,2923908,2923910,19199,2,"    And that would be in the form of some type of _x000D_
no-fly zone----"
2923910,2923909,2923911,19199,2,"    Because no-fly has the military, you know, _x000D_
label right up front, I would call it a humanitarian safe haven _x000D_
zone. But definitely I would want such a zone to be protected _x000D_
from whoever might try to mess around with people who are _x000D_
refugees who are just seeking safety, yes."
2923911,2923910,2923912,19199,2,"    Very good. Well, General, I know you have got _x000D_
a hard stop in 20 minutes, and I think we have--you have _x000D_
certainly helped us in the way that we wanted you to help us. _x000D_
We appreciate your testimony._x000D_
    I would have one question, and that is you, in response to _x000D_
Senator Flake, talked about the need for Congress to be behind _x000D_
the effort that is taking place with ISIL. There have been _x000D_
differing discussions about the length of time from an AUMF _x000D_
standpoint. And is there anything about the timeframe--I know _x000D_
the President has asked for three--whether it is longer, _x000D_
shorter? Is there anything about that that you think matters at _x000D_
all relative to those that you are talking about appealing to _x000D_
our enemies and allies together?"
2923912,2923911,2923913,19199,2,"    And if it was shorter than that, it would _x000D_
trouble you either."
2923913,2923912,2923914,19199,2,"    No, no, no, it would not trouble us either. _x000D_
Thank you. Does the length of time really particularly matter _x000D_
to you from the standpoint of the allies and those that we are _x000D_
defeating, or is it just more Congress getting behind the _x000D_
effort in a bipartisan way?"
2923914,2923913,2923915,19199,2,"    Yes. Well, listen, I called you over the _x000D_
weekend when I knew you were on your way to Kuwait. I know you _x000D_
are your way to CENTCOM now. I think you can tell by the _x000D_
respect that everyone has shown you today we all view you as _x000D_
someone who is an outstanding public servant. We appreciate the _x000D_
way you have gone about your work._x000D_
    I know it is difficult. I know that decisions do not always _x000D_
get made in the manner or in the timeframe that someone like _x000D_
you that wants to seek this--get this done in the appropriate _x000D_
way. But I think your demeanor, the way you talk with all of us _x000D_
is certainly very, very well received. We wish you well in what _x000D_
you are doing, and hope you will be before us again soon to _x000D_
update us."
2923915,2923914,2923916,19199,2,    Thank you.
2923916,2923915,2923917,19199,2,    Thank you.
2923917,2923916,2923918,19199,2,"    And with that, the record will be open until _x000D_
Friday for any questions."
2923918,2923917,2923919,19199,2,"    We would ask that you and your staff respond _x000D_
to those in a fairly timely fashion._x000D_
    And the meeting is adjourned."
2923919,2923918,2923920,19200,1,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will now come _x000D_
to order. We have convened this hearing to examine modern _x000D_
slavery and what is being done about it. We recognize that the _x000D_
United States Congress and our executive agencies have worked _x000D_
hard to draw attention to and address modern slavery, but I _x000D_
believe we have come to a point where we can do more. We need _x000D_
to take these efforts to the next level._x000D_
    I think most Americans would be stunned to know that _x000D_
slavery still exists in this world. Let me pause to state that _x000D_
again. It is difficult to imagine that in this modern day, more _x000D_
than 27 million around the world are forced to live as slaves. _x000D_
At this hearing, in addition to our expert witnesses, we will _x000D_
hear from two individuals who suffered and ultimately escaped _x000D_
this experience, and went on to help others. And we thank them _x000D_
for being with us today._x000D_
    Modern forms of slavery thrive where the rule of law is _x000D_
weakest. Corruption, crime, and cultural attitudes contribute _x000D_
to a climate of low risk and impunity for those who profit from _x000D_
modern slavery. In many instances, modern slavery is a crime of _x000D_
opportunity for perpetrators. It is often practiced quite _x000D_
openly, for example, in brick or rug manufacturing or in bars _x000D_
or brothels._x000D_
    Under U.S. law, such conditions are defined as the most _x000D_
severe forms of trafficking in persons, including forced sexual _x000D_
servitude of minors and adults and persons in bonded and other _x000D_
forced labor conditions. Women, children, and men alike are _x000D_
subjected to involuntary labor or sexual exploitation. _x000D_
According to a leading nongovernmental organization, forced _x000D_
labor accounts for 74 percent of victims, and forced sexual _x000D_
servitude accounts for 26 percent of victims. Women and girls _x000D_
are especially vulnerable, accounting for 54 percent of _x000D_
victims. Children under the age of 18 account for 26 percent of _x000D_
victims._x000D_
    We have been to countries and met with people who have _x000D_
survived this horrific experience, and heard from people who _x000D_
work to end modern slavery. U.S. Government and private _x000D_
philanthropic funding are spurring increasingly sophisticated _x000D_
efforts to combat modern slavery. There is a growing consensus _x000D_
that in order to end the practice of modern slavery, reliable _x000D_
baseline data and consistent and effective monitoring and _x000D_
evaluation are needed to deal with this issue. Leveraging and _x000D_
coordinating private and government funding are also seen as _x000D_
key challenges by many in the antimodern slavery community._x000D_
    Today we will explore these questions to help inform our _x000D_
thinking on how we can maximize our efforts and take them to _x000D_
the next level, and to find the best way forward to begin the _x000D_
process in earnest of putting an end to modern slavery. With _x000D_
that, I turn to our distinguished ranking member, Bob Menendez."
2923920,2923919,2923921,19200,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for _x000D_
calling a very important hearing. Human trafficking in the form _x000D_
of sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced marriage, debt _x000D_
bondage, and the sale and exploitation of children is one of _x000D_
the greatest moral challenges of our time. And the numbers are _x000D_
staggering._x000D_
    As we speak, there are 50 million refugees and displaced _x000D_
people in the world, the largest number since World War II. All _x000D_
are at risk of exploitation, and some will fall victim to human _x000D_
trafficking. This is not a new phenomenon, but there are new, _x000D_
more sinister factors exacerbating it. With the growth of _x000D_
transnational organized crime, the rise of brutal nihilistic _x000D_
groups, like ISIL and Boko Haram, and sectarian violence _x000D_
forcing millions to flee their homes._x000D_
    The International Labor Organization estimates that there _x000D_
are at least 21 million victims of human trafficking in the _x000D_
world. Over 5 million of them are children. It is estimated _x000D_
that forced labor alone generates $150-plus billion in profits _x000D_
annually, making it the second-largest income source for _x000D_
international criminals next to the drug trade, making it _x000D_
obscenely lucrative for unscrupulous labor brokers to induce _x000D_
people to cross borders, thinking that they are going for legal _x000D_
work, only to trap them in labor or sexual exploitation._x000D_
    NGOs and civil society have been doing what they can to _x000D_
combat human trafficking, and business and governments should _x000D_
do more to help. Governments can muster more political will, _x000D_
companies can clean up their supply chains and make that _x000D_
information public, and the public can be more aware of who _x000D_
picks the fruit on their breakfast cereal in the morning, or _x000D_
who slaved in the sweatshop to sell the shirt on their back. _x000D_
This hearing helps raise that awareness._x000D_
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I will look forward to working _x000D_
with you in the coming months on a bipartisan approach to _x000D_
ending every form of human trafficking around the world."
2923921,2923920,2923922,19200,1,"    Thank you, and I want to thank others for _x000D_
being here. We will now turn to our witnesses, and we _x000D_
appreciate the tremendous commitment that they have shown in _x000D_
this effort._x000D_
    Our first witness is Gary Haugen, the founder and president _x000D_
of International Justice Mission, IJM, a global organization _x000D_
that protects the poor from violence by partnering with local _x000D_
authorities to rescue victims, bring criminals to justice, _x000D_
restore survivors, and strengthen justice systems. IJM combats _x000D_
modern slavery, sex trafficking, rape, police brutality, _x000D_
property grabbing, and other forms of violence in Africa, Latin _x000D_
America, South Asia, Southeast Asia._x000D_
    Before founding IJM, he served as the director of the U.N. _x000D_
investigation of the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, and as _x000D_
a human rights attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice. He _x000D_
has been recognized by the U.S. State Department as a _x000D_
trafficking in persons hero. I have gotten to know him _x000D_
personally, and he certainly deserves that recognition._x000D_
    Our second witness is Shawna Bader-Blau. I am going to call _x000D_
you ``Shawna'' if that is okay. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    Shawna is the executive director of the Solidarity Center _x000D_
in Washington, DC, the largest global worker rights _x000D_
organization in the United States. Solidarity Center works with _x000D_
partners and allies from more than 400 unions, nongovernmental _x000D_
organizations, legal aid groups, and human rights defenders _x000D_
from around the world to help workers exercise their rights and _x000D_
improve their working conditions._x000D_
    Prior to her appointment as executive director, she served _x000D_
as the Solidarity Center's regional program director for the _x000D_
Middle East and North Africa, where she worked directly with _x000D_
victims of forced labor and human trafficking, and with labor _x000D_
activists and human rights defenders._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and for sharing your thoughts and _x000D_
viewpoints today. We would like to remind you that your full _x000D_
testimony, full statements will be included in the record _x000D_
without objection. So if you could please keep your remarks to _x000D_
about 5 minutes, we would appreciate it so members can engage _x000D_
you in questions. And with that, Mr. Haugen, if you would _x000D_
begin, we would appreciate it."
2923922,2923921,2923923,19200,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Shawna._x000D_
_x000D_
STATEMENT OF SHAWNA BADER-BLAU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOLIDARITY _x000D_
                     CENTER, WASHINGTON, DC"
2923923,2923922,2923924,19200,3,"    Well, thank you both. Great testimony and we _x000D_
really appreciate your efforts in being here and your efforts _x000D_
regarding this issue._x000D_
    I have come to believe that through Congress, we can create _x000D_
and lead a vision to end modern day slavery. I really believe _x000D_
that. And we have had conversations with both the private _x000D_
sector and public sector--some partners around the world. I _x000D_
really believe that, undoubtedly, with the United States behind _x000D_
it, we can lead, we can solve this, and we can bring others to _x000D_
the table._x000D_
    One of the things that I have learned is that many _x000D_
organizations are adopting best practices, okay? And, Gary, if _x000D_
I could, my staff has prepared a number of questions, but I was _x000D_
able to go to the Philippines and see your work there. And I _x000D_
would just say to the audience and the people here that seeing _x000D_
the 22 young women that we saw that day, you would have to be _x000D_
not a human being to sit through that with dry eyes._x000D_
    I would just like, with my time, if you could just walk _x000D_
through how you go into a jurisdiction and build from the _x000D_
ground up the type of effort that you just talked about so that _x000D_
others might hear."
2923924,2923923,2923925,19200,3,"    So, the question is, I mean, as we begin to _x000D_
look at doing something, mobilizing on a global scale, is what _x000D_
you have done there, in your opinion, something that can be _x000D_
replicated around the world where slavery is just a part of the _x000D_
culture there?"
2923925,2923924,2923926,19200,3,"    You know, you compared this to malaria. We _x000D_
have had some of the same results in PEPFAR because we have _x000D_
continued to focus on treatment, although there is always a _x000D_
push, as you mentioned earlier, to sort of move out into other _x000D_
areas. But if you focus on treatment, then you have the kind of _x000D_
results, and we have been able to do that. This committee has _x000D_
been able to make sure that the focus is on treatment._x000D_
    One of the things that I think people would be concerned _x000D_
about is how do you know you are achieving the results that are _x000D_
laid out with an issue like this? Could you talk to us a little _x000D_
bit about how you set the base and how we can actually measure _x000D_
the results in a way that if we were to lead an effort like _x000D_
this, we would know that we were actually achieving results?"
2923926,2923925,2923927,19200,3,"    And in closing, Shawna, in listening to that, _x000D_
I know you have had a tremendous amount of experience in supply _x000D_
chains and efforts in that regard. Do you think we are at a _x000D_
point in time where we can measure success and that these types _x000D_
of best practices can be multiplied in other places around the _x000D_
world?"
2923927,2923926,2923928,19200,3,"    Thank you for that full answer, and I am _x000D_
sorry I went over just a little bit. As we turn to our _x000D_
distinguished ranking member--thank you both again--Senator _x000D_
Menendez."
2923928,2923927,2923929,19200,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, _x000D_
you get to go over as long as you want as far as I am _x000D_
concerned. In any event, thank you both for your testimony and, _x000D_
more importantly, for your work._x000D_
    I want to start with you, Mr. Haugen. Basically, I heard _x000D_
your overarching theme is that we have to end impunity if we _x000D_
want to end slavery at the end of the day, modern day slavery. _x000D_
And so, that to me means in addition to the infrastructure that _x000D_
your ministry has built and working on creating the access to _x000D_
those who are the victims of slavery, bringing their stories _x000D_
and information to light, it means governments have to have a _x000D_
willingness to fight because impunity ultimately prevails if _x000D_
governments are not willing ultimately to prosecute._x000D_
    So I heard you in response to the chairman talk about how _x000D_
some of the work that you have done has helped governments _x000D_
incline, but have you found governments that are not inclined _x000D_
to put a priority to the question of ending impunity in modern _x000D_
slavery? And if so, how do we break through with those _x000D_
governments?"
2923929,2923928,2923930,19200,3,"    And when you were talking about creating _x000D_
community support, I would assume those are individuals who are _x000D_
not the victims of trafficking, but others in the community who _x000D_
bore the slavery and trafficking that is taking place, and try _x000D_
to create a change in their government. Is that right?"
2923930,2923929,2923931,19200,3,"    And let me ask you this. What can we do _x000D_
from your experience, what can governments, and the private _x000D_
sector, and the public sector do to increase protections for _x000D_
potential trafficking victims during conflicts, which _x000D_
increasingly seems to be one of our challenges?"
2923931,2923930,2923932,19200,3,"    Ms. Bader-Blau, I am interested. You _x000D_
mentioned Qatar as one of your examples. In January, I sent a _x000D_
letter to the Secretary of State with our concerns about the _x000D_
realities of forced labor and foreign labor during Qatar's _x000D_
infrastructure projects in advance of the 2022 World Cup. And _x000D_
while we applaud Qatar for winning the site of the World Cup, _x000D_
we also know that in this lead-up to the dramatic _x000D_
infrastructure work that needs to take place, there are real _x000D_
challenges to some of the workers who are falling in the same _x000D_
type of slavery that you acknowledge. So I will look forward to _x000D_
seeing the Secretary's response to that._x000D_
    So, you gave some pretty powerful examples of what workers _x000D_
themselves can do as it relates to trying to end human _x000D_
trafficking and slavery, particularly in the labor context. _x000D_
What more can governments do to end forced labor in the supply _x000D_
chain, and what more can the private sector do? Mr. Haugen said _x000D_
that there is a powerful incentive for the private sector to _x000D_
get it right because they do not want to have their brand _x000D_
tarnished. In a different context, I have been pursuing this _x000D_
with workers in Bangladesh. The question I want to know from _x000D_
you from your perspective, what can the governments do to _x000D_
create a more powerful action against the impunity, and also _x000D_
what can corporations do."
2923932,2923931,2923933,19200,3,"    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923933,2923932,2923934,19200,3,"    Thank you. Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Risch."
2923934,2923933,2923935,19200,3,"    Thank you very much, and thank you for your _x000D_
testimony. One thing that you did not pay much attention to, _x000D_
something that struck me in the years I have been on this _x000D_
committee and on the Intelligence Committee, is a condition _x000D_
around the world that most Americans really are unaware of, and _x000D_
probably would be surprised that in the United States and only _x000D_
a handful of other countries, bribery is not acceptable._x000D_
    In listening to witnesses from all over the world talking _x000D_
about the issues that they have, particularly when it comes to _x000D_
nonenforcement of laws, bribery seems to be ubiquitous around _x000D_
the world. And obviously the less money there is, the more _x000D_
powerful money becomes. A person who wants to stay in power, be _x000D_
it through votes or whatever else, will ignore the rule of law _x000D_
in order to garner votes. And it surprises me how ubiquitous it _x000D_
is, how acceptable it is, how in parts of the world it has _x000D_
quasi-legal status, even legal status in some parts of the _x000D_
world._x000D_
    So, what do you do when you run into this? First of all, is _x000D_
this an area of your concern, and secondly, what do you when _x000D_
you run into that where, okay, you have found the problem, you _x000D_
have identified who the people are, who the actors are. You _x000D_
have got a law that is on the books. And, like you said, there _x000D_
is reluctance on the government's part, and probably at least _x000D_
on occasion that it is a result of bribery. What do you do in _x000D_
that kind of a--first of all, how common is this, and then, _x000D_
secondly, what do you do with it? Mr. Haugen first."
2923935,2923934,2923936,19200,3,"    That is assuming, of course, they cannot get _x000D_
to the people at the top that are hiring these units that will _x000D_
go out there."
2923936,2923935,2923937,19200,3,    It operates at the lower levels.
2923937,2923936,2923938,19200,3,    Shawna.
2923938,2923937,2923939,19200,3,"    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923939,2923938,2923940,19200,3,    Senator Cardin.
2923940,2923939,2923941,19200,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you all _x000D_
very much for your work. In my work with the Helsinki _x000D_
Commission and the OSCE, trafficking has always been a very, _x000D_
very high priority. And I think one of the most impressive _x000D_
visits I have done is to visit victims' centers in foreign _x000D_
countries because it shows that the community understands that _x000D_
those who have been trafficked are victims, and that if you _x000D_
need to get papers in order to be legal, you have a resource _x000D_
you can go to and escape the person who has trafficked you. So, _x000D_
I would just point out that there are ways to counter this, and _x000D_
that we should be looking at it._x000D_
    One of the great achievements in dealing with trafficking _x000D_
in the United States is the Trafficking in Persons Report. It _x000D_
was not easy to convince the State Department that they needed _x000D_
to be engaged. Now, they are very proud of the work that we do _x000D_
in trafficking and on the TIP Report. Whenever I have an _x000D_
ambassador from another country or a foreign minister in my _x000D_
office, I always have the TIP Report, and I always go over _x000D_
trafficking with them and ways that they can improve in _x000D_
trafficking, because the issue is not just with the origin _x000D_
country or even the destination country, but also the transit _x000D_
country. So, there are different areas that you can stop the _x000D_
trafficking, and a war zone is one of the other three. There _x000D_
are other areas that can help us prevent that type of _x000D_
trafficking._x000D_
    My first question is, How can we improve the TIP Report to _x000D_
deal with your concerns? I know countries do not want to be on _x000D_
the Tier 2 Watch List and certainly not the Tier 3, but there _x000D_
is waiver authority, and there is concern as to whether we can _x000D_
make the TIP reports even more effective, particularly dealing _x000D_
with trafficking and forced labor."
2923941,2923940,2923942,19200,3,"    Let me go to your point that you raised on _x000D_
transparency in the supply chain. We looked at voluntary ways _x000D_
to get more transparency in different areas. In extractive _x000D_
industries we have the EITI, which is a voluntary way countries _x000D_
can come together to disclose their energy and mineral _x000D_
contracts so that we can trace money that should go to the _x000D_
country itself but may go toward corruption. We found EITI to _x000D_
be helpful, but it is still not enough. So in the Congress we _x000D_
have passed a transparency bill known as Cardin-Lugar that _x000D_
requires mandatory SEC filings from extractive industries._x000D_
    What would you recommend in regard to transparency in the _x000D_
supply chain dealing with forced labor? Do we need a mandatory _x000D_
reporting requirement in the United States that would hopefully _x000D_
then be picked up by other countries so that we can get a more _x000D_
comprehensive view, or are you to believe that we can develop _x000D_
the protocols voluntarily within the business community in this _x000D_
regard?"
2923942,2923941,2923943,19200,3,"    And I assume that the United States is _x000D_
going to have to lead here. If we do not do it, other countries _x000D_
will not take the initiative."
2923943,2923942,2923944,19200,3,"    My last question deals with the _x000D_
opportunities under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. _x000D_
Malaysia is one of the TPP aspirants. They are on Tier 3 in the _x000D_
TIP Report. What would you expect us to be able to accomplish _x000D_
in successful TPP negotiations as it relates to trafficking?"
2923944,2923943,2923945,19200,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923945,2923944,2923946,19200,3,"    Thank you, and thanks for your leadership on _x000D_
this issue the entire time you have been in Congress, and for _x000D_
being here today, absolutely._x000D_
    Senator Isakson."
2923946,2923945,2923947,19200,3,"    I want to follow up on Senator Cardin's _x000D_
point and your response. You know, we found in Africa with the _x000D_
Millennium Challenge Corporation and the moneys that are _x000D_
invested in Africa, we conditioned a lot of those investments _x000D_
based on a lessening of corruption and improvement in labor _x000D_
standards. And we have in some cases taken countries out of _x000D_
those programs because they would not cooperate._x000D_
    When we do the TPP, one of the main things we want to do is _x000D_
use the leverage if these countries want to do business with _x000D_
the United States to have incremental improvements in the way _x000D_
they treat their labor and a total disregard for human _x000D_
trafficking. Would you agree with that?"
2923947,2923946,2923948,19200,3,"    And we found incremental is acceptable as _x000D_
long as when they violate an increment, they have a punishment _x000D_
for it, and they actually realize there is a consequence."
2923948,2923947,2923949,19200,3,"    I read your story in your testimony about _x000D_
the Indian woman who hired a recruiter 20 years ago to find her _x000D_
a job, and the recruiter found her a job in Kuwait City. She _x000D_
and her husband followed the recruiter to Kuwait City, and if I _x000D_
read it correctly, the University of Kuwait hired her, and she _x000D_
has for 2 years washed towels in the women's dormitory at the _x000D_
University of Kuwait. Was never allowed out of the building _x000D_
where she washed those towels, and was not allowed to see her _x000D_
husband._x000D_
    And it occurred to me that I know traffickers take _x000D_
advantage of poverty, and they take advantage of weakness and _x000D_
illness. Are they also taking advantage of the treatment of _x000D_
women under Sharia law or in Islamic states where women are a _x000D_
second-class citizen by virtue of that religion, because Kuwait _x000D_
City with its great university, you would think as an employer, _x000D_
the university would everything to have equality for the women. _x000D_
But to actually be employing the woman in a substandard job, _x000D_
and almost holding her as a slave, is the religion a part of _x000D_
that? Is it cultural? What is it?"
2923949,2923948,2923950,19200,3,"    Following up on--since you are talking, I _x000D_
will follow up with one question I have for you. Every golf cap _x000D_
I have bought in the last 25 years was made in Bangladesh, and _x000D_
we have seen a tremendous movement of textiles to Asia and the _x000D_
Pacific region. How are our companies in America doing in terms _x000D_
of holding producers of those products to a higher standard in _x000D_
terms of their labor laws in those companies?"
2923950,2923949,2923951,19200,3,"    How are U.S. companies who retail those _x000D_
products--are there any--are U.S. companies showing--shining a _x000D_
light on better treatment for those workers and trying to avoid _x000D_
doing business with people who are actually holding people in _x000D_
slavery?"
2923951,2923950,2923952,19200,3,"    But I am talking about in terms of the _x000D_
workers in the country where the baseball caps are made, for _x000D_
example."
2923952,2923951,2923953,19200,3,"    If an American company buys them and _x000D_
trademarks them, with their trademark on them, do you see _x000D_
evidence of United States companies putting a standard of _x000D_
excellence or a standard of behavior on those countries in _x000D_
terms of their labor laws?"
2923953,2923952,2923954,19200,3,"    That is the point I wanted--Mr. Chairman, _x000D_
I wanted to make that point because--he is in a conversation _x000D_
with the ranking member. But I wanted to make that point for _x000D_
this reason. Senator Coons and I went to South Africa 2 years _x000D_
ago and toured some textile finishing plants that were _x000D_
finishing products for sale in the United States of America. _x000D_
And the companies, and I am not going to get into names, but _x000D_
the companies that were buying the finished product from _x000D_
those--were requiring standards of better treatment of their _x000D_
workers, and were using that as a marketing tool in the United _x000D_
States for the product they were selling. And that is where you _x000D_
take the paradigm of taking the advantage of poverty away and _x000D_
taking advantage of excellence in marketing. And so, I think _x000D_
that is a good point to continue to make."
2923954,2923953,2923955,19200,3,    Thank you.
2923955,2923954,2923956,19200,3,"    I will get you some good information after _x000D_
the meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923956,2923955,2923957,19200,3,"    Thank you, Senator. Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Gardner."
2923957,2923956,2923958,19200,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for _x000D_
time and testimony today. Before this hearing, I had an _x000D_
opportunity to visit with the Colorado Organization for Victim _x000D_
Assistance. I met with them back in Colorado, and had followup _x000D_
with them prior to this hearing just to talk about some of the _x000D_
things that we see, that we hear, that we face in Colorado and _x000D_
our States. And in some of the--some of the information they _x000D_
sent, some of the articles, some of the studies that they had _x000D_
reported, it talked about how when it comes to human _x000D_
trafficking issues--this is your modern day slavery--that many _x000D_
of the victims and many of the foreign national trafficking _x000D_
victims have been assisted by the Colorado Organization for _x000D_
Victim Assistance, come to this country legally with guest _x000D_
worker visas. Is that true?"
2923958,2923957,2923959,19200,4,"    So we are not really talking about like _x000D_
somebody who has not come to this country illegally, who snuck _x000D_
through the cracks--gotten through the cracks somehow and is _x000D_
not accounted for, but is somebody that we know through the _x000D_
process. Is that the case around the world as well?"
2923959,2923958,2923960,19200,4,"    I think one of the challenges that we have _x000D_
as policymakers, as leaders in this effort to combat this, I _x000D_
think a lot of people think that this may be related to _x000D_
immigration when it is not. I mean, this is actually just--you _x000D_
know, in terms of documents or visas, that is not the issue. _x000D_
The issue is how people are treating--how we are holding people _x000D_
accountable._x000D_
    There is a story that they shared about two brothers from _x000D_
Peru who came to Colorado, who were working on a sheep ranch in _x000D_
western Colorado. And it talked about how they were treated, _x000D_
how they were abused, how they had been--passports withheld, _x000D_
and it talks about how they escaped. It talks about this very _x000D_
telling story, this very emotional story about how they were _x000D_
able to escape, and what they did, and the fear that they lived _x000D_
under, and who they went to for assistance, not knowing whether _x000D_
their employer was going to find them and trap them back into _x000D_
this great tragedy again._x000D_
    Are we doing enough in the United States to hold those _x000D_
employers accountable, to make examples? When this is reported, _x000D_
are we doing enough so that when we talk to other nations, when _x000D_
we enter into agreements, that they can look at us without _x000D_
hypocrisy knowing that we have done everything we have said we _x000D_
want them to do? Are we doing enough?"
2923960,2923959,2923961,19200,4,    Go ahead.
2923961,2923960,2923962,19200,4,"    And there have been things like the _x000D_
Polaris Project, which up until this past year had Colorado _x000D_
ranked very low in terms of its laws and protections it was _x000D_
providing to workers. But as a result of changes made by the _x000D_
State legislature, this past year rank it in the top tier, in _x000D_
fact, one of the States with the best laws to protect people._x000D_
    When we look around the globe, though, are we able to see _x000D_
those kinds of changes being made in the way that we--Colorado _x000D_
has a law basically on the books that stated laws against _x000D_
trafficking, trafficking in children statute. They had that on _x000D_
the books, but the courts interpreted it in such a way that the _x000D_
person had to literally own a child victim and transfer _x000D_
ownership in order for them to be convicted under the statute. _x000D_
Now, that statute has been changed. Do we see those same kinds _x000D_
of legal loopholes or problems around the globe that are _x000D_
allowing people to get off the hook?"
2923962,2923961,2923963,19200,4,    And are--I am sorry. Please.
2923963,2923962,2923964,19200,4,"    And how are we doing in terms of _x000D_
coordination with local law enforcement, State law enforcement, _x000D_
I mean, in terms of the laws international organizations, _x000D_
associations? How are we doing with that coordination to make _x000D_
sure that we have the communication available to prevent this?"
2923964,2923963,2923965,19200,4,    Thank you.
2923965,2923964,2923966,19200,4,"    Thank you. Thank you very much._x000D_
    Senator Rubio."
2923966,2923965,2923967,19200,4,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this _x000D_
hearing. At the outset, let me congratulate you for the title, _x000D_
``Ending Modern Slavery.'' That is exactly what it is. I have _x000D_
no problem with the term ``trafficking,'' except I think it _x000D_
sometimes sanitizes what we are talking about. ``Trafficking'' _x000D_
makes it sound like people are just being moved around from _x000D_
point A to point B. It is not the moving around as much as what _x000D_
happens once they get there. And I think ``modern slavery'' _x000D_
accurately assesses it._x000D_
    To that point, we have an ambassador at large for _x000D_
trafficking in persons--it should be an ambassador at large for _x000D_
ending human slavery or modern slavery--that has sat vacant for _x000D_
a number of--for quite a period of time. I hope that there will _x000D_
be a nomination and that we can get that confirmed because I _x000D_
think that is important in terms of the U.S.'s role around the _x000D_
world on this issue._x000D_
    I wanted to touch on two subjects. The first is, and we had _x000D_
not touched on this yet, but let me ask you this. There have _x000D_
also been reports of abuses in the diplomatic corps here in the _x000D_
United States. Do you have any unique insight into some of _x000D_
those abuses and how they have used their diplomatic status to _x000D_
bring--in some instances we have seen here in Washington, to _x000D_
see domestic workers that are actually being not compensated _x000D_
and held against their will?"
2923967,2923966,2923968,19200,4,"    I know that sex trafficking and sex slavery _x000D_
gets a lot of attention and rightfully so. I want to talk about _x000D_
that. My point is that it is the labor slavery that really is _x000D_
still the predominant number, and it can happen anywhere. I _x000D_
mean, people would be shocked at how prevalent it is here _x000D_
domestically._x000D_
    I wanted to ask you domestically for a moment in the United _x000D_
States about three topics. The first is on the sex slavery _x000D_
side. Do you have any sort of insight about how many, _x000D_
particularly women, but even children, obviously women. Let me _x000D_
focus on that first, the adult women, who are in the trade now _x000D_
could be considered people that are being trafficked and/or _x000D_
held against their will? It is my personal view that virtually _x000D_
all of them are one way or another because coercion is not _x000D_
necessarily someone holding a gun to your head or someone _x000D_
refusing to pay you. But things like drug addiction are used as _x000D_
a tool. Things like fear of escape, even psychologically. It _x000D_
has been my experience in the interaction I have had with law _x000D_
enforcement involved in this that you should consider virtually _x000D_
every woman in that industry as being a victim of slavery _x000D_
basically."
2923968,2923967,2923969,19200,4,"    The reason why I ask you this, and I wanted _x000D_
you to comment as well, Ms. Blau, there are publications in the _x000D_
United States that openly advertise on their pages for these _x000D_
services. And, in fact, the same publications, like ``Village _x000D_
Voice,'' that have gone on to write articles ridiculing this _x000D_
whole notion that there is human slavery in the United States--_x000D_
that there is slavery in the United States with regards to the _x000D_
sex trade. And there has been all sorts of actions taken here _x000D_
to condemn that._x000D_
    And the reason why I ask you that question is because _x000D_
oftentimes when law enforcement interacts, for example, with _x000D_
women that are being--that are in prostitution and have, in my _x000D_
opinion, been coerced into it either through drug addiction, _x000D_
abuse, or a combination thereof, there is a debate within the _x000D_
law enforcement community about whether they should be treated _x000D_
as perpetrators or as victims. And we have had this debate in _x000D_
Florida as well._x000D_
    When you interact with someone that you basically have _x000D_
found at a brothel or, in some instances, some of these massage _x000D_
parlors and so forth, the debate has been should we arrest _x000D_
them, and put them in jail, and treat them as a perpetrator, or _x000D_
should we pull them out of that environment, put them into a _x000D_
safe place where they can realize that there is an escape for _x000D_
them, and they can break that pattern. And we have gotten a lot _x000D_
of pushback from both law enforcement and prosecutorial _x000D_
agencies who believe that it is important to treat them as a _x000D_
perpetrator first, that that is the only way you are going to _x000D_
get them see differently._x000D_
    Do you have an opinion on the right way to address that, _x000D_
because it has been--it is an issue of controversy in the law _x000D_
enforcement community?"
2923969,2923968,2923970,19200,4,"    I know I am out of time. In your experience, _x000D_
the majority of people from abroad that are here in the _x000D_
commercial sex industry, did they know they were coming to that _x000D_
industry when they were brought?"
2923970,2923969,2923971,19200,4,    Okay.
2923971,2923970,2923972,19200,4,"    False pretense. They thought they were _x000D_
coming here to make a commercial product, and they ended up _x000D_
trapped in this industry."
2923972,2923971,2923973,19200,4,    Thank you.
2923973,2923972,2923974,19200,4,"    Thank you. You all have been outstanding _x000D_
witnesses. In my opening comments I mentioned the role Congress _x000D_
has played. But, I think because of your efforts and so many _x000D_
advocates from around our country, the administration, too, I _x000D_
think is very focused on this. I know Secretary Kerry recently _x000D_
referred to a much more robust effort. So I think this is _x000D_
something that we can all work on together in a very positive _x000D_
way, and I want to thank you both for a lifetime of effort in _x000D_
this regard, for being here today, for sharing your _x000D_
experiences, and for working with us in the future. Thank you _x000D_
very much._x000D_
    And now we will have the second panel. Do we have our _x000D_
second panel?"
2923974,2923973,2923975,19200,4,"    They get mentioned enough, thank you."
2923975,2923974,2923976,19200,4,    That is a former congressional staffer.
2923976,2923975,2923977,19200,5,"    We will now turn to our witnesses for the _x000D_
second panel. Thank you for being here. Our first witness is _x000D_
Mr. James Kofi Annan. In 2013, he was awarded the World's _x000D_
Children Prize for his work to stop child slavery. He himself _x000D_
was a fishing slave as a child for 7 years. He managed to _x000D_
escape, get an education, and become a bank manager. In 2007 he _x000D_
left the bank to work solely to stop child slavery. By that _x000D_
time, he had already started an organization called Challenging _x000D_
Heights in 2003, which has liberated over 500 children from _x000D_
slavery._x000D_
    Liberated slave children come first through Challenging _x000D_
Heights' safe home for 65 children. Challenging Heights also _x000D_
runs a school for 700 pupils of different ages. They offer _x000D_
training to poor mothers so that they can support their _x000D_
families and do not just sell their children into slavery. He _x000D_
has supported over 10,000 children who have been slaves or at _x000D_
risk for slavery. Thank you for being here._x000D_
    Our second witness is Shandra Woworuntu, the founder of a _x000D_
nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering human _x000D_
trafficking survivors through mentorship and job training. She _x000D_
graduated from college with a major in finance and bank _x000D_
management in her native Indonesia. After graduation, she _x000D_
became the manager of the Treasury Department of the Korea _x000D_
Exchange Bank in Indonesia, specializing in money market _x000D_
trading._x000D_
    When political turbulence erupted, she lost her job because _x000D_
of economic, religious, and racial persecution. She applied for _x000D_
a job that promised a 6-month position in the hotel industry in _x000D_
Chicago, which led her to become--and to survive being--a _x000D_
victim of a criminal human trafficking organization. Thank you _x000D_
again for being here today._x000D_
    Our next witness is David Abramowitz. He is vice president _x000D_
of policy in government relations at Humanity United, a _x000D_
foundation that focuses on advancing human freedom by combating _x000D_
human trafficking and modern slavery, among other human rights _x000D_
issues. Previously he served as Department of State's Office of _x000D_
Legal Advisor._x000D_
    In 1999, he joined the staff of the Committee on Foreign _x000D_
Affairs for the House of Representatives, and served as chief _x000D_
counsel. Over the next year 10 years, he worked on such _x000D_
legislation as the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Act of _x000D_
2000 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection _x000D_
Reauthorization Act of 2008._x000D_
    And with that, we will recognize James Kofi Annan. If you _x000D_
would begin and just go in order. Thank you all for being here."
2923977,2923976,2923978,19200,6,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Ms. Woworuntu."
2923978,2923977,2923979,19200,7,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Mr. Abramowitz."
2923979,2923978,2923980,19200,8,"    Well, thank you for your testimony, and your _x000D_
entire statement will be made a part of the record. And thank _x000D_
you each for what you have said today and for sharing your _x000D_
experiences._x000D_
    Mr. Kofi Annan, how aware are the people of Ghana that this _x000D_
slavery issue exists, and what is it that would motivate _x000D_
parents to allow their children to become a part of this?"
2923980,2923979,2923981,19200,8,"    And the parents, though they are obviously _x000D_
aware in many of the cases that their children are being _x000D_
victims of slavery, are they not?"
2923981,2923980,2923982,19200,8,"    Thank you very much. Ms. Woworuntu, you are _x000D_
obviously incredibly well educated, had a great job in _x000D_
Indonesia, and yet ended up in a situation here in the United _x000D_
States through a recruiter where you were in obviously a very _x000D_
terrible situation, fortunately escaped, and are helping _x000D_
others. Could you tell me a little bit about how that occurred, _x000D_
what the experience was with the recruiter? And then post that, _x000D_
how the prosecution worked with you here in the United States?"
2923982,2923981,2923983,19200,8,"    Very impactful. Thank you both. And in order _x000D_
to be courteous to my colleagues, I will press on. I may want _x000D_
to come back, if it all right, and ask you a question._x000D_
    Senator Menendez."
2923983,2923982,2923984,19200,8,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank both _x000D_
of you for being willing to come forth and talk about your _x000D_
incredibly compelling experiences and the strength of human _x000D_
dignity to overcome. And it is really, I think, two very _x000D_
compelling stories among many I am sure that exists. I _x000D_
appreciate that, and I want to ask you questions in a minute._x000D_
    Before I get to you, I want to ask Mr. Abramowitz, since _x000D_
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was enacted in 2000, _x000D_
what has been the U.S. Government's top achievements for _x000D_
combating human trafficking, and what has been its key _x000D_
failures?"
2923984,2923983,2923985,19200,8,"    One other question. We heard a lot of the _x000D_
testimony so far about these recruiters, and they seem to be a _x000D_
significant part of the process in which people ultimately get _x000D_
led to trafficking because they create the nexus between the _x000D_
workforce and then the exploitation._x000D_
    I get a sense that we do not really do very much about _x000D_
pursuing recruiters. Is there not a better way to go after _x000D_
these recruiters, to think about whether or not they should, as _x000D_
we find recruiters that are actually in the midst of the _x000D_
exploitation, deny them visas to the United States, take other _x000D_
actions, look at that as a criminal enterprise? Give me some _x000D_
sense about that."
2923985,2923984,2923986,19200,8,"    Okay. You mentioned Nepal. The Guardian _x000D_
reported that in 2014, Nepal citizens working in Qatar, that _x000D_
one died every 2 days because of extreme heat and conditions _x000D_
that should not be accepted. So I think we have the Qatari _x000D_
Foreign Minister here. It might be a good opportunity to raise _x000D_
some of these issues with him."
2923986,2923985,2923987,19200,8,"    Ms. Woworuntu, first of all, thank you _x000D_
for your work that you are doing in the State of New Jersey on _x000D_
the Human Trafficking Commission. We appreciate your service. _x000D_
And in that regard, you know, when you talked about your _x000D_
experience, how is we--that you think from your experience, _x000D_
that we get law enforcement and the judicial system to work _x000D_
better with trafficking victims to investigate and successfully _x000D_
prosecute those who put you into slavery?_x000D_
    You described a set of circumstances in which you were not _x000D_
believed. You were thought to be a voluntary sex worker. A _x000D_
whole different set of circumstances, and you almost had to _x000D_
fight for credibility. It almost seems to me that there should _x000D_
be some type of basis under which you are believed until proven _x000D_
that that is not true. I mean, give me a sense of how you think _x000D_
we might be able to do better."
2923987,2923986,2923988,19200,8,"    Thank you. Thank you both for your _x000D_
insights, and I just want to know, Ms. Woworuntu, that by New _x000D_
Jersey standards, ``busted'' is a mild world. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    So, thank you."
2923988,2923987,2923989,19200,8,"    There is more I could say, but I will not."
2923989,2923988,2923990,19200,9,    Senator Kaine.
2923990,2923989,2923991,19200,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to _x000D_
you all for your very illuminating testimony, and to the chair _x000D_
and ranking member for calling this hearing. The timing is _x000D_
exquisite. Yesterday the Vatican announced that this Sunday _x000D_
would be an international day of prayer against human _x000D_
trafficking, and the date of February 8 was chosen because it _x000D_
is the feast day for St. Josephine Bakhita, who was born in _x000D_
1868 in Darfur, kidnapped at age 9, and then sold into slavery _x000D_
twice in her life, once in Sudan and once in Italy, before she _x000D_
passed away in 1947. And so, that is a good thing. I think the _x000D_
church communities around the world, and this is an ecumenical _x000D_
effort, educating us all about signs and what we can do to help _x000D_
is very important._x000D_
    I just have sort of one question, and I am not exactly _x000D_
sure--in some ways I had a State Department person here, but _x000D_
let me just throw the question out. And, Ms. Woworuntu, it is _x000D_
kind of about your experience. Trafficking in slavery, _x000D_
different kinds. There is between nations other than the United _x000D_
States. There is slavery and trafficking within the United _x000D_
States. Your story is one from another nation into the United _x000D_
States, and I want to ask about that._x000D_
    It would seem that we should be able to develop training _x000D_
for consular officials who are interviewing applicants for _x000D_
visas. We should be able to develop training for our Customs _x000D_
and Border Patrol folks that are interviewing visitors as they _x000D_
come into the United States, that would not always discover _x000D_
whether somebody was a victim of trafficking, but would, you _x000D_
know--there has got to be some warning signs that we should be _x000D_
training our people about._x000D_
    Is that something that we do well already, or is there more _x000D_
we can do with our consular officials and our Border Patrol _x000D_
folks to make sure that we can stop trafficking as it is _x000D_
occurring? And I would love to hear from any of you on that."
2923991,2923990,2923992,19200,9,    Excellent. Mr. Abramowitz.
2923992,2923991,2923993,19200,9,"    Like the other members of the committee, I _x000D_
do a good bit of traveling. And any time I travel, I try to sit _x000D_
down with our troops who are in the places I am, but I also try _x000D_
to sit down with Foreign Service officers on their first or _x000D_
second tours just to hear about the challenges. And almost all _x000D_
in early tours are working in consular capacities, and, you _x000D_
know, I am struck by how hard their job is. The volume of _x000D_
applications is huge, and it is very difficult._x000D_
    But it would seem like, you know, we ought to be able to _x000D_
give kind of almost profile information. You know, here is the _x000D_
kind of thing to watch out for that might suggest that there is _x000D_
trafficking going on. And we ought to have enough institutional _x000D_
expertise within State, and DHS, and everybody that is--DOL and _x000D_
DOJ that is working on this, to give that kind of information, _x000D_
both in the consular officers and at the Border Patrol sites. _x000D_
So that is a question that I will follow up with maybe for the _x000D_
record or follow up directly with the agencies about."
2923993,2923992,2923994,19200,9,    Yes.
2923994,2923993,2923995,19200,9,"    All right. Thank you very much for your _x000D_
testimony today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2923995,2923994,2923996,19200,9,"    Thank you, Senator Kaine. I want to thank you _x000D_
for being here. I think this has been most impactful. I want to _x000D_
thank our ranking member for his shared interest in this topic _x000D_
and for allowing this hearing to go forward today as it has, _x000D_
and hopefully it will produce results here._x000D_
    To the two witnesses who have been victims, I want to thank _x000D_
you for the courage to be here, but also taking your _x000D_
experiences and using it to help other people, and to help us _x000D_
today, first, to understand some of the cultural issues and the _x000D_
lack of awareness. I mean, it seems to me that one of the easy _x000D_
to produce outcomes is to make sure people are more fully _x000D_
aware, and that parents understand what is happening in various _x000D_
countries with their young ones._x000D_
    And to understand the tremendous plight of victims, who, in _x000D_
many cases, are not dealt with as victims. That is an _x000D_
experience that we heard from others. And, again, just creating _x000D_
more awareness with the law enforcement agencies, but also _x000D_
making sure that we use best practices, and your efforts to _x000D_
work through public policy to deal with this effectively. All _x000D_
three of you have been outstanding witnesses. Our first panel _x000D_
certainly was a very good panel. And as Senator Kaine _x000D_
mentioned, I cannot imagine a better time for us to be focused _x000D_
on this._x000D_
    The issue regarding foreign officials, we do have a meeting _x000D_
today with a Foreign Minister, and, candidly, the topic is _x000D_
ISIS. And a lot of times we do get caught up, as we should, in _x000D_
important issues of national security. But to be aware of this _x000D_
issue also, and to be able to push this as we meet with other _x000D_
officials, but also to produce some public policy hopefully _x000D_
that will deal with this on a far grander scale with a much _x000D_
bigger vision._x000D_
    So thank you all for being here. Your testimony was _x000D_
outstanding._x000D_
    And for the information of the members, the record will _x000D_
remain open until the close of business on Friday, February the _x000D_
6th, including for members to submit questions for the record. _x000D_
We ask, if you will, to respond as promptly as you can to _x000D_
those. Your responses will also be made a part of the record._x000D_
    And with the thanks of the committee, this hearing is now _x000D_
adjourned. Thank you."
2923996,2923995,2923997,19200,9,    Thank you.
2923997,2923996,2923998,19200,11,"    This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations _x000D_
Committee will come to order._x000D_
    And thank you so much for being here. I will introduce you _x000D_
in one moment._x000D_
    I want to thank the other committee members for their _x000D_
interest._x000D_
    We have convened this hearing to understand how U.S. _x000D_
leadership can best be deployed to deal a mortal wound to _x000D_
modern slavery. Last week, the committee heard from two panels _x000D_
of private witnesses. We received testimony from leaders in the _x000D_
effort to combat modern slavery. We also heard from brave _x000D_
individuals who escaped from modern slavery and went on to help _x000D_
others._x000D_
    Today we welcome Dr. Sarah Sewall. I have heard many good _x000D_
things about the Under Secretary of State for Civilian _x000D_
Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of _x000D_
State. The State Department's office to monitor and combat _x000D_
trafficking in persons falls under your purview, and we _x000D_
appreciate your efforts._x000D_
    Conflict exposes vulnerable people, especially women and _x000D_
children, to being enslaved and exploited. The horrifying _x000D_
examples set by ISIL and Boko Haram could not be starker._x000D_
    But even in countries with laws and institutions, insidious _x000D_
forms of modern slavery exists. Perversely labor recruiters _x000D_
extract money from impoverished people with empty promises and _x000D_
deliver them into bondage and sexual exploitation._x000D_
    For 14 years, as defined and authorized by Congress, the _x000D_
State Department has issued an annual report on trafficking in _x000D_
persons. This report, as Secretary Kerry has said, sets the _x000D_
gold standard. The report reviews the efforts of countries to _x000D_
address trafficking in persons especially in the most severe _x000D_
forms. Its findings are not always welcome, but we know they _x000D_
have made a difference._x000D_
    Under Secretary Sewall has said that almost every issue she _x000D_
touches has implications for human trafficking. Whether working _x000D_
with the Bureau of Counterterrorism, Democracy, Human Rights, _x000D_
and Labor, Population Migration and Refugees, International _x000D_
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Conflict and _x000D_
Stabilization Operations, often there is a trafficking angle._x000D_
    Today we hope to learn how U.S. leadership is already _x000D_
making a difference and how, working in partnership with the _x000D_
State Department and reaching out to like-minded governments, _x000D_
we can take our efforts to the next level to find the best way _x000D_
forward to begin the process in earnest of putting an end to _x000D_
modern slavery._x000D_
    Thank you._x000D_
    And with that, I will turn to our distinguished ranking _x000D_
member, Bob Menendez."
2923998,2923997,2923999,19200,11,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you _x000D_
for your focus on addressing the issue of trafficking in all of _x000D_
its forms. Sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced marriage, _x000D_
debt bondage, and the sale and exploitation of children around _x000D_
the world should be a global cry for justice. But as Benjamin _x000D_
Franklin said, justice will not be served until those of us who _x000D_
are unaffected are as outraged as those who are._x000D_
    Today we are all outraged at the violence, psychological _x000D_
terror, the greed that drives human trafficking. We are _x000D_
outraged that there are 50 million refugees and displaced _x000D_
people around the world, the largest number since World War II, _x000D_
many of whom are targets of traffickers. We are outraged that _x000D_
there are 21 million victims of human trafficking, over 5 _x000D_
million of whom are children, and that forced labor generates _x000D_
about $150-plus billion in profits annually, the second-largest _x000D_
income source for international criminals next to the drug _x000D_
trade._x000D_
    We know that NGOs and civil society have been doing what _x000D_
they can to combat this scourge, but we can all do more. The _x000D_
State Department's Office of Trafficking in Persons has been _x000D_
nothing less than extraordinary, but it remains understaffed, _x000D_
underresourced and without leadership, leaving Under Secretary _x000D_
Sewall's efforts all the more important. Certainly Government _x000D_
can do better. Companies can do more. They can clean up the _x000D_
supply chains and make that information public. The public can _x000D_
be more aware of who picks the fruit on their breakfast cereal _x000D_
in the morning, how many women and children it took trapped in _x000D_
a sweat shop to sew the dresses and shirts they are wearing._x000D_
    In my view, reform of the labor recruitment process and the _x000D_
regulation of labor recruiters is crucial to helping enslaved _x000D_
Bangladeshi women serving as domestic servants in the Middle _x000D_
East, construction workers from Nepal building World Cup Soccer _x000D_
stadiums in Qatar, or Rohingya men trapped on Thai shrimp boats _x000D_
supplying American fish markets. Those are just some of those _x000D_
elements._x000D_
    And finally, Mr. Chairman, let me just say I am also _x000D_
outraged at the scourge of diplomats who themselves are _x000D_
trafficking domestic workers, bringing them to the United _x000D_
States to work in embassies and missions here in Washington and _x000D_
around the world. We had a case like this in my home State of _x000D_
New Jersey. I know Secretary Kerry has committed to preventing _x000D_
such abuse, and I look forward to hearing what is actually _x000D_
being done. And I am anxious to hear what is being done to _x000D_
mitigate the diplomatic situation that arose in the high-_x000D_
profile case of an Indian Deputy Counsel General in New York _x000D_
who was charged with visa fraud in a trafficking-like _x000D_
situation. But I look forward to seeing what we are doing in _x000D_
that regard as well, and I look forward to hearing our witness."
2923999,2923998,2924000,19200,11,"    Thank you, Senator Menendez, and thank you _x000D_
for your shared interest in this issue and your comments._x000D_
    And now we will turn to our witness. Our witness today is _x000D_
Dr. Sarah Sewall, the Under Secretary of State for Civilian _x000D_
Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. She was sworn in as _x000D_
Under Secretary on February 20, 2014, and serves concurrently _x000D_
as the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues._x000D_
    Over the previous decade, Dr. Sewall taught at Harvard _x000D_
Kennedy School of Government, where she also served as director _x000D_
of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, launched the MARO _x000D_
Project, Mass Atrocities Response Operations. In 2012, she was _x000D_
Minerva Chair at the Naval War College. During the Clinton _x000D_
administration, Dr. Sewall served as the inaugural Deputy _x000D_
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Peacekeeping and _x000D_
Humanitarian Assistance. Prior to joining the executive branch, _x000D_
she served 6 years as the senior foreign policy advisor to U.S. _x000D_
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell._x000D_
    I want to thank you for being here. You have had a very _x000D_
distinguished career. You are either really, really qualified _x000D_
or cannot keep a job. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    But you have done a lot of different things. But I think it _x000D_
is the first._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and sharing your testimony. And we _x000D_
will remind you that your full statement will be entered into _x000D_
the record. Thank you."
2924000,2923999,2924001,19200,12,"    Thank you for that great testimony._x000D_
    And the bulk of the State Department's activities, _x000D_
programmatic and funding, actually falls under your purview, _x000D_
and I know there are a number of different entities that are _x000D_
dealing with this. Could you share with us how they are working _x000D_
with each other, and is there anything that might be done to _x000D_
enhance their ability to do so?"
2924001,2924000,2924002,19200,12,"    I know that entities like Daesh, or ISIL, _x000D_
enslave people, and I realize this is a minor part of the 27 _x000D_
million we know are affected by this. But could you tell us: do _x000D_
these types of entities help further their efforts through _x000D_
human trafficking? Are they taking advantage of this same kind _x000D_
of thing? I do not want to spend a lot of time on it. Because _x000D_
of its currency though, I thought I would just ask."
2924002,2924001,2924003,19200,12,"    Now, are they doing that to fund their _x000D_
activities?"
2924003,2924002,2924004,19200,12,"    One of the things we have seen in the field _x000D_
is that rule of law is one of the best ways, if not the best _x000D_
way, to combat this where you hold perpetrators accountable. Do _x000D_
you agree that that is one of the best ways to deal with this _x000D_
issue and to curtail the activity?"
2924004,2924003,2924005,19200,12,"    Last week, when we had a hearing, Senator _x000D_
Menendez and I happened to be meeting with a public official _x000D_
from a country where we knew this was an issue. And so Senator _x000D_
Menendez actually brought it up in that meeting. I guess one of _x000D_
my questions is--obviously there are ways of leveraging this. I _x000D_
mean, just awareness. I know as we meet with people where we _x000D_
know in their own countries this is happening a great deal, it _x000D_
makes a difference._x000D_
    How are we leveraging through our diplomatic efforts around _x000D_
the world awareness and actually implementation of policies to _x000D_
really cause this to be lessened?"
2924005,2924004,2924006,19200,12,"    And I know right now--this is my last point I _x000D_
guess--this Trafficking in Persons Office really does not have _x000D_
anybody who is the Ambassador at Large, if you will. I assume _x000D_
that you have taken on those responsibilities and we can count _x000D_
on you, in spite of not having someone there, to continue _x000D_
pursuing it heavily."
2924006,2924005,2924007,19200,12,"    Thank you. Thanks for your commitment and _x000D_
testimony today._x000D_
    Senator Menendez."
2924007,2924006,2924008,19200,12,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    In November 2014, the Government Accountability Office _x000D_
published a report on efforts to combat trafficking on U.S. _x000D_
Government contracts overseas entitled ``Human Trafficking: _x000D_
Oversight of Contractors' Use of Foreign Workers in High-Risk _x000D_
Environments Needs to be Strengthened.''_x000D_
    The GAO investigators spoke to migrant workers on U.S. _x000D_
contracts overseas who had paid an equivalent of up to 1 year's _x000D_
wages to unsavory recruiters in order to secure their jobs._x000D_
    So as we are talking about trafficking and modern day human _x000D_
slavery, it is pretty mind-boggling that on U.S. Government _x000D_
contracts we might have an iteration of that._x000D_
    So how does State ensure that U.S. Government contracts _x000D_
overseas are not used as a vehicle for trafficking workers?"
2924008,2924007,2924009,19200,12,    What is the date of that Executive order?
2924009,2924008,2924010,19200,12,    What was----
2924010,2924009,2924011,19200,12,"    All right. Well, I am informed that the _x000D_
Executive order was issued before the GAO's report._x000D_
    But as in anything, we can have all the laws in the world _x000D_
and all the Executive orders in the world. It is enforcement _x000D_
that matters in order to send a very clear message that we _x000D_
would, as a government, not tolerate in our own supply chain _x000D_
having that. So I hope we are going to pay particular attention _x000D_
to that._x000D_
    How does the Department of State work with its partners to _x000D_
strengthen source country policies, for example, places like _x000D_
Bangladesh and Nepal, to prevent fraudulent recruitment _x000D_
practices? Because in the previous hearing that we had, it was _x000D_
a big element of these recruiters or a big part of the _x000D_
challenge we have here. So do we have any specific focus on _x000D_
that?"
2924011,2924010,2924012,19200,12,"    Okay._x000D_
    Now, the Trafficking in Persons Report, we have all _x000D_
recognized, is a significant tool in our efforts here. And the _x000D_
chairman referred to the fact that we have no Ambassador at _x000D_
Large in that role. So I assume that your answer to him is that _x000D_
you are personally going to protect the integrity of the TIP _x000D_
Report overall and especially with regard to particular _x000D_
countries that may be subject to intense political pressure _x000D_
within the building?"
2924012,2924011,2924013,19200,12,"    Are there particular countries whose _x000D_
trends you find concerning?"
2924013,2924012,2924014,19200,12,"    I hope when you do the report that you _x000D_
would share with the committee insights as to trends that you _x000D_
see developing, whatever those trends may be. It would be very _x000D_
helpful."
2924014,2924013,2924015,19200,12,"    Finally, according to the State _x000D_
Department's own Trafficking in Persons Report, the Government _x000D_
of Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum standards for _x000D_
the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant _x000D_
efforts to do so. It continues to be a source country for _x000D_
adults and children subjected to sex trafficking and conscripts _x000D_
doctors and medical personnel to work overseas under conditions _x000D_
that resemble forced labor. As a matter of fact, that happens _x000D_
to be the number one source of income to the Castro regime is _x000D_
forcing doctors to go abroad and work and then having the _x000D_
payment for those doctors sent back to Cuba._x000D_
    So between that--and Voyeur magazine had an article, Sex _x000D_
Trafficking Capital of the World,'' several years back about _x000D_
Cuba. Can you tell me whether or not trafficking has been _x000D_
raised and prioritized throughout the administration's new _x000D_
engagement with Havana?"
2924015,2924014,2924016,19200,12,    And how so?
2924016,2924015,2924017,19200,12,"    I would note, Mr. Chairman, that the _x000D_
Secretary's response suggests that the government is complicit _x000D_
in trafficking, and that makes it all the more--in my mind, one _x000D_
thing is to have a blind eye to what is happening in your _x000D_
country. The other thing is to be complicit in the trafficking. _x000D_
And that is the reality of Cuba._x000D_
    Thank you for your answer."
2924017,2924016,2924018,19200,12,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    Senator Gardner."
2924018,2924017,2924019,19200,12,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the _x000D_
hearing again._x000D_
    Thank you, Madam Under Secretary, for being here today._x000D_
    I believe the United States should set an example on _x000D_
eradicating the scourge of modern day slavery and human _x000D_
trafficking worldwide, that we need to set that example. We _x000D_
have to be the example here at home so we can show our partners _x000D_
abroad that we have done the work ourselves that we need to._x000D_
    That is why I am concerned that right here in the United _x000D_
States, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline _x000D_
received nearly four times as many calls in 2013, as recently _x000D_
as 2013, as they did in 2008, with calls rising from 5,748 to _x000D_
20,000, almost 21,000 calls in 2013 alone._x000D_
    During the last week's panel, the witness from Humanity _x000D_
United stated in his written testimony that estimates suggest _x000D_
that as many as 300,000 U.S. children are at risk of being _x000D_
trafficked into the commercial sex trade._x000D_
    I mentioned last week as well work that we have done in _x000D_
Colorado with the Colorado Organization for Victims Assistance. _x000D_
They are 100 percent funded right now, I believe, through the _x000D_
Office of Victims of Crime. They have done a lot of work with a _x000D_
number of victims of modern day slavery and continue to work as _x000D_
well as a subcontractee for the United States Committee on _x000D_
Refugees and Immigrants. And I think there is an issue that _x000D_
they are trying to work out right now through this committee as _x000D_
an OVC grantee and whether or not they can utilize the refugee _x000D_
and immigrant funding for OVC victims in the grantee office. So _x000D_
perhaps we could talk a little bit about some of those issues _x000D_
as well as we work through that and get your help with Justice _x000D_
on this._x000D_
    They have done a lot of work in terms of setting and _x000D_
meeting the metrics required to help assure funding is going _x000D_
toward victims of trafficking. Would you agree, though, that we _x000D_
need to do more here in the United States to increase our _x000D_
efforts to combat human trafficking so they would be a better _x000D_
example abroad?"
2924019,2924018,2924020,19200,12,    I understand.
2924020,2924019,2924021,19200,12,"    I understand. No, thank you. I understand._x000D_
    And are you familiar with the Tier 3 list of countries in _x000D_
the reports that talk about their responses to trafficking?"
2924021,2924020,2924022,19200,12,"    Sure. No problem._x000D_
    You know, these are the most persistent violators of U.S. _x000D_
antihuman trafficking laws and subject to U.S. sanctions under _x000D_
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, including the _x000D_
withdrawal of nonhumanitarian, non-trade-related foreign _x000D_
assistance._x000D_
    There is a letter here from the White House dated September _x000D_
18, 2014. It mentions several nations whether it is Cuba, _x000D_
Russia, others in terms of Tier 3 sanctions._x000D_
    Could you talk about the economic impact that these _x000D_
sanctions have had on the targeted countries and how much U.S. _x000D_
assistance to these states has been blocked?"
2924022,2924021,2924023,19200,12,"    Maybe perhaps a few highlights. I mean, _x000D_
for instance, Cuba is listed here. Saudi Arabia is listed here. _x000D_
Just perhaps in Tier 3."
2924023,2924022,2924024,19200,12,"    If they have already been sanctioned for _x000D_
other causes and we are sanctioning them again under this, are _x000D_
they effective? Are they accomplishing what we are trying to _x000D_
do, or are there other things that we need to be doing?"
2924024,2924023,2924025,19200,12,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924025,2924024,2924026,19200,12,    Senator Shaheen.
2924026,2924025,2924027,19200,12,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Under Secretary Sewall, it is nice to see you back in the _x000D_
Government."
2924027,2924026,2924028,19200,12,"    Yes. We had an opportunity to work _x000D_
together at the Kennedy School, and I saw the great work that _x000D_
you did there._x000D_
    It was really hearing from students at the Kennedy School _x000D_
that I think first opened my eyes to the issue of trafficking _x000D_
in persons. I had not really been aware and it had not _x000D_
crystallized as something that was occurring in the prevalence _x000D_
that it does around the world until I listened to some of those _x000D_
young people talking about it._x000D_
    And so what more can we do? You have talked about the _x000D_
programs that the State Department is doing to address _x000D_
trafficking, but what more can we do to make people aware of _x000D_
the extent to which this is an issue and the need for all of us _x000D_
to be aware of it and to call attention if we see anything that _x000D_
we think contributes to trafficking?"
2924028,2924027,2924029,19200,12,"    Thank you._x000D_
    As we are talking about the products that we use in the _x000D_
developed world that often are available because of trafficked _x000D_
persons, are we addressing that issue as we are looking at the _x000D_
two major trade agreements that we are negotiating now, TTIP _x000D_
and the TTP, and can you talk about how we have addressed it in _x000D_
those agreements?"
2924029,2924028,2924030,19200,12,    Right. I appreciate that.
2924030,2924029,2924031,19200,12,"    That is great. And how are we working with _x000D_
our European allies to address this issue and to what extent is _x000D_
it more or less prevalent in Europe than in the United States _x000D_
or North America?"
2924031,2924030,2924032,19200,13,"    Well, thank you very much for the great _x000D_
work that you and the Department are doing."
2924032,2924031,2924033,19200,13,"    Thank you all._x000D_
    And thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Menendez, for _x000D_
organizing this hearing."
2924033,2924032,2924034,19200,13,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Cardin."
2924034,2924033,2924035,19200,13,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    The title of this hearing, I think, really speaks to our _x000D_
mission, ``Ending Modern Slavery,'' the critical priority that _x000D_
this must be for our country, and the importance of U.S. _x000D_
leadership, because we know we are not going to make progress _x000D_
internationally if the United States does not maintain a very _x000D_
strong position._x000D_
    So I want to drill down a little bit on what Senator _x000D_
Shaheen said. I very much respect the work that you do and that _x000D_
your team does. It is critically important. You have been a _x000D_
voice for people around the world, and you have brought about _x000D_
significant improvements around the world. And we very much _x000D_
appreciate that._x000D_
    But as Senator Menendez said, there are certain _x000D_
opportunities that you have that you have really got to take _x000D_
advantage of. Senator Menendez mentioned Cuba. There is an _x000D_
opportunity there. We have their attention. And I must tell _x000D_
you, as things become more normal and trade starts, you lose _x000D_
that leverage._x000D_
    So I appreciate your answer to Senator Shaheen, and I agree _x000D_
with you that in the trade agreements we hope we will see _x000D_
stronger labor protections, greater emphasis on good governance _x000D_
and anticorruption efforts, and enforcement of these _x000D_
provisions. But it would give me a little bit more comfort if I _x000D_
knew your views on why Malaysia is a Tier 3 country and still a _x000D_
candidate for TPP. What changes can we expect to see _x000D_
implemented in Malaysia before the trade agreement is signed, _x000D_
or is there sufficient enforcement in the trade agreement being _x000D_
negotiated so that Malaysia will not be a Tier 3 country _x000D_
enjoying a trade agreement with the United States. What _x000D_
assurances can you give us?"
2924035,2924034,2924036,19200,14,"    I thank you for that._x000D_
    I just remind you that there are rumors going around here _x000D_
that we may be asked to vote on trade promotion authority _x000D_
within the next couple weeks. So there is not a lot of time to _x000D_
get back to us on this. Normally, we would put in trade _x000D_
promotion authority what we expect to be accomplished by the _x000D_
trade agreements. And I could be pretty specific as it relates _x000D_
to trafficking, and perhaps you will help me draft language to _x000D_
deal with compliance with the criteria that we use in the TIP _x000D_
Report that we could add to TPA. That might be helpful if the _x000D_
administration is so inclined. But I would like to have _x000D_
specific information on this."
2924036,2924035,2924037,19200,15,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I would also like to have recommendations from you as to _x000D_
how we can improve the Trafficking in Persons Report. You _x000D_
mentioned that as you get closer to the publication dates, you _x000D_
see activities. It would also I think be helpful if we could _x000D_
figure out how we could perhaps improve the reporting _x000D_
requirements in an effort to make this tool an internationally _x000D_
recognized tool. How can we strengthen it?"
2924037,2924036,2924038,19200,15,"    Do you know whether there has been a _x000D_
sharing of the standards that you use in evaluating countries _x000D_
under the TIP Report with our trade negotiators so that they _x000D_
have more objective ways of determining progress made in good _x000D_
governance in countries dealing with trafficking?"
2924038,2924037,2924039,19200,15,"    If you could get back to me on that, I _x000D_
would appreciate it."
2924039,2924038,2924040,19200,16,"    My last question deals with transparency. _x000D_
Some of my colleagues have already talked about that. We have _x000D_
found that transparency works well. When we look at _x000D_
multinational companies that have access to our markets, the _x000D_
chain of supply and the companies that they have dealt with and _x000D_
their labor practices, et cetera, the more transparency that _x000D_
you can show on those issues, the less chance we will see _x000D_
support for trafficking in labor. Is that an area in which you _x000D_
are also talking with the trade negotiators to make sure that _x000D_
we have more transparency in the countries that we are dealing _x000D_
with, that we do not see our multinational companies supporting _x000D_
trafficking?"
2924040,2924039,2924041,19200,17,"    I appreciate that very much, and I look _x000D_
forward to working with you and you getting back to me. Thanks."
2924041,2924040,2924042,19200,17,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    I know Senator Menendez had a closing question and comment."
2924042,2924041,2924043,19200,17,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    I want to follow up on Senator Cardin's point because this _x000D_
issue boggles my mind sometimes. And I know from your _x000D_
confirmation hearing, which I was privileged to chair, you are _x000D_
eminently qualified for the position you now hold. But _x000D_
sometimes in an institution like the State Department, you have _x000D_
to have sharper elbows. And to hear the answer about Malaysia, _x000D_
as by way of one example, as we are negotiating, I mean, a _x000D_
trade agreement should not have already raised these _x000D_
trafficking issues to countries that are on the TIP Report _x000D_
list. Because the fact of the matter is that it undermines, I _x000D_
think, our moral authority to say that we are willing to do _x000D_
business with you but, you know, on this question--you know, _x000D_
you are on our Trafficking In Persons list, but we are willing _x000D_
to do business with you. That is a tough proposition._x000D_
    So I would hope that you would take a more activist role in _x000D_
looking at how you take your TIP Report, which I think we all _x000D_
agree is a very powerful tool, and look at other elements of _x000D_
our Government to make sure that we are in harmony with what we _x000D_
are trying to pursue. Otherwise, whether it be contracting, _x000D_
whether it be negotiations for trade or other elements, I think _x000D_
we erode the very essence of what we are trying to pursue. And _x000D_
so in some respects, I do not want us to be duplicitous in the _x000D_
way in which we look at this because otherwise I am not sure _x000D_
that we are going to achieve a goal that I know the chairman is _x000D_
very singularly focused on here and which I share his views on."
2924043,2924042,2924044,19200,17,"    And I understand what you are saying, but _x000D_
let me maybe try to crystallize my point. That a regional _x000D_
bureau raises the question or knowledge that the TIP Report _x000D_
says this about this country who you are negotiating with is _x000D_
one thing. That the Under Secretary for this position raises _x000D_
that at a level that is more among equals is a much more _x000D_
powerful set of circumstances."
2924044,2924043,2924045,19200,17,"    Well, listen, I want to thank you for your _x000D_
efforts. I think you have been an excellent witness. I _x000D_
appreciate what you are doing at the State Department. _x000D_
Obviously, we want to see things move along even more quickly, _x000D_
and I think we are going to be working toward an end here very _x000D_
soon that will be very complementary to what you are doing. And _x000D_
we thank you again for your service to our country, for being _x000D_
here today, for being an outstanding witness, and we look _x000D_
forward to working with you on a continual basis."
2924045,2924044,2924046,19200,17,"    Thank you._x000D_
    The hearing is adjourned."
2924046,2924045,2924047,19201,1,"    So I am going to call the--call the meeting _x000D_
to order. And I would say to people in the audience that we _x000D_
would appreciate you refraining. We understand people have _x000D_
strong emotions about much of what happens in this committee _x000D_
and others, and we hope you will respect the work of the _x000D_
committee._x000D_
    I have never operated a gavel. I learned as a young man how _x000D_
to operate a hammer. I understand my staff told me to be a _x000D_
little more gentle with this, but I want to welcome--I want to _x000D_
welcome everybody to the committee._x000D_
    We switched sides. That was not symbolic. I understand just _x000D_
because of the number of seats, it works better this way._x000D_
    I do want to welcome the new members to the committee and _x000D_
say that under Senator Menendez's leadership, I really believe _x000D_
that this committee has caused its profile to rise._x000D_
    We have passed a number of very important pieces of _x000D_
legislation out of this committee, and I think it is because of _x000D_
his leadership that that has happened. And I want to thank him _x000D_
for that._x000D_
    I want to say to all of the committee members that we plan _x000D_
certainly to build upon that. We have a number of very _x000D_
important issues to deal with. The Nation has put its trust in _x000D_
us to deal with these issues in a sober way, and I think that _x000D_
the issue today that we will be talking about really reminds us _x000D_
of the indispensable nature of U.S. leadership._x000D_
    I think the committee has, like any committee, we have _x000D_
important things to deal with, and we have urgent things to _x000D_
deal with. And we need to do both. Important is for us to _x000D_
continue as a committee to show that the importance of _x000D_
strategic U.S. engagement and how that improves our economy and _x000D_
makes us safer here at home._x000D_
    At the same time, we need to make sure that our taxpayer _x000D_
dollars are spent wisely. And so, while it will take some time _x000D_
to build, I would like for us to work toward a State Department _x000D_
authorization. I think all of us know that we have not passed _x000D_
one since 2002._x000D_
    So what that means is the State Department is basically _x000D_
operating off of policies that we passed 13 years ago. And if _x000D_
we really want to leverage our efforts, what would make sense--_x000D_
and I look forward to working with Ranking Member Menendez in _x000D_
this way--would be for us to ensure that what the State _x000D_
Department is doing is leveraging those kind of things that we _x000D_
would like to see happen._x000D_
    I do not want to shy away from difficult issues. This first _x000D_
hearing certainly is evidence of that. I want to make sure that _x000D_
the views of all committee members are heard. I want to make _x000D_
sure that we strengthen our Nation in the process._x000D_
    Today, we are here to talk about Iran. And I want to say to _x000D_
our witnesses thank you for being here. I think there are _x000D_
legitimate concerns by almost everybody on this committee, and _x000D_
it is not in any way disloyal. It is not an infringement upon _x000D_
anybody else to say that we have legitimate concerns._x000D_
    And when you think about where we are in the Iran _x000D_
negotiations, so we had six U.S. security resolutions--U.N. _x000D_
security resolutions that called for full suspension of _x000D_
enrichment. We then moved to this standard called practical _x000D_
needs. In other words, if you are in Iran and you have--if you _x000D_
want to do enrichment, even though that is in violation of the _x000D_
U.N. Security Council resolutions, what are the practical needs _x000D_
of the country?_x000D_
    And by all estimation, that is maybe 500 centrifuges. And _x000D_
yet we know the negotiations have moved way beyond that. We _x000D_
know that._x000D_
    We talked about dismantlement, and we have concerns of what _x000D_
dismantlement now means. Some people are saying that means _x000D_
simply unplugging or disconnecting the plumbing, to use very _x000D_
coarse terms._x000D_
    People are concerned about research and development. We _x000D_
spend a lot of time talking about IR-1s and IR-2s, and yet we _x000D_
know the Iranians are way beyond that--we are talking about IR-_x000D_
6, IR-7--way beyond that in research and development. The _x000D_
agreement itself does not speak at all to ballistic missile _x000D_
development. Significant concerns for all of us._x000D_
    And we believe that--although I am not sure this is the _x000D_
case. I had a meeting last night, and maybe this is not true, _x000D_
and I know that some of you can enlighten us here today. But we _x000D_
are concerned about what we are really going to cause Iran to _x000D_
do relative to their past military dimensions. I think most of _x000D_
us think they were way down the road in their military _x000D_
development up until 2003, and I think we would like to _x000D_
understand the type of technology that they have developed._x000D_
    And I know this, and you all have shared this with us in _x000D_
all kinds of meetings, they still are stiff-arming the IAEA _x000D_
relative to access to many of their facilities, which obviously _x000D_
continues to cause us to have great concerns about their _x000D_
trustworthiness._x000D_
    I think all of us know they are destabilizing the region. _x000D_
We watch what is happening in Yemen. We watch what is happening _x000D_
with Hezbollah and Iran. We watch what is happening with Hamas. _x000D_
We know that they are--even with the minor amounts of money _x000D_
that has been lessened from the sanctions regime that Senator _x000D_
Menendez and Senator Kirk and all of us worked together to put _x000D_
in place, even with that minor amount of money, we know that _x000D_
that has enhanced their ability to destabilize the region. We _x000D_
know that._x000D_
    And you can imagine if we end up with a really bad deal _x000D_
that ends up creating a nuclear arms race in the region and _x000D_
makes the world less safe and yet much more money is released, _x000D_
they can destabilize the region more. So, obviously, there are _x000D_
significant concerns._x000D_
    I am proposing some legislation--and I look forward to _x000D_
hearing from you all today, and we are vetting it with people _x000D_
on this committee--that builds off the 123 agreements that we _x000D_
have in place right now. Senator Markey is very familiar with _x000D_
this._x000D_
    But we--27 times this Nation has approved a 123 agreement _x000D_
with another nation under a civil nuclear arrangement where _x000D_
we--you all reach an agreement with a country, and we approve _x000D_
it. Secretary Kerry came in and said that he wants to make sure _x000D_
that any agreement that happens passes muster with Congress. I _x000D_
would like to understand today how you would like to see us _x000D_
pass muster._x000D_
    One way to do it is an up-or-down vote. I know there have _x000D_
been a lot of discussions, and I do not know if Senator _x000D_
Menendez will speak to this, a lot of discussions about what we _x000D_
might do, what we might not do. I have talked to Prime Minister _x000D_
Cameron. I talked to the U.K.--excuse me, European Union _x000D_
negotiator last night in my office. Some of us were in Israel _x000D_
this weekend over this very same issue._x000D_
    We have heard no one, no one say that if Congress were to _x000D_
weigh in on the final agreement it would have anything--it _x000D_
would in any way destabilize the negotiations. And as a matter _x000D_
of fact, we understand that Iran's Parliament may have to _x000D_
approve their agreement._x000D_
    So I hope today you will share with us the appropriate role _x000D_
for us to play. We obviously have our own thoughts. We thank _x000D_
you for being here._x000D_
    And with that--I am sorry to give such a long opening _x000D_
comment--to the Ranking Member Menendez."
2924047,2924046,2924048,19201,1,"    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And let me also welcome our new colleagues on the _x000D_
committee. This is an extraordinary committee to serve on, _x000D_
which is a confluence of both the national security of the _x000D_
United States, the national economic imperatives of the United _x000D_
States in the global context, as well as major issues for which _x000D_
America is exceptional on democracy, human rights, among other _x000D_
issues. So I welcome you, and I think you are going to find it _x000D_
an extraordinary experience._x000D_
    Since this is the first hearing that we have had of the new _x000D_
committee as assembled, I want to congratulate the chairman on _x000D_
his ascendancy to the chairmanship. I want to say that during _x000D_
the 2 years that I was chairman, we worked extraordinarily well _x000D_
in a collaborative fashion. And in the midst of partisanship in _x000D_
the Senate as a whole, this committee was an island of _x000D_
bipartisanship on so many major issues that overwhelmingly _x000D_
passed the committee in almost every instance with strong _x000D_
bipartisan support._x000D_
    And we look forward to working with you in the same _x000D_
context, with the same comity, and with the same goals at the _x000D_
end of the day. And we look forward to you having a very _x000D_
successful chairmanship of the committee._x000D_
    I want to, in the context of the hearing, say that I share _x000D_
your concerns that the Iranians are playing for time. Over the _x000D_
past 18 months, we have been moving closer to their positions _x000D_
on all key elements--on the Arak reactor, on Fordow, on _x000D_
enrichment, and on Iran's disclosure of the military dimensions _x000D_
of its nuclear program._x000D_
    And I think we need to review how we got to this point. _x000D_
Iran, over the course of 20 years, deceived the international _x000D_
community and violated not U.S., but U.N. Security Council _x000D_
resolutions to arrive within weeks of achieving nuclear _x000D_
breakout capacity. And Iran came to the table only after the _x000D_
cumulative impact of years of sanctions began to affect the _x000D_
regime's economic and political stability._x000D_
    For us to give up the leverage of sanctions--which would _x000D_
take years to reimpose--we need a deal that truly reverses _x000D_
their nuclear program rather than just buying a little time. _x000D_
This is why I am concerned about more than breakout time._x000D_
    I am concerned the agreement will not provide a clear _x000D_
picture of the military dimensions of Iran's program--which are _x000D_
critical to understand to know how far down the road they were _x000D_
as it relates to weaponization; so that we understand the _x000D_
timeframes of any breakout capacity vis-a-vis weaponization; so _x000D_
that we know just how close Iran is to being able to make a _x000D_
nuclear weapon._x000D_
    And I am concerned that instead of dismantling and closing _x000D_
Arak and Fordow, as we were told was going to be the case at _x000D_
the beginning of these negotiations by the administration, the _x000D_
Arak reactor will now be converted to some form and Fordow--a _x000D_
facility built under a mountain--which I do not think you do _x000D_
for civilian purposes, will be repurposed._x000D_
    After 18 months of stalling, Iran needs to know that there _x000D_
will be consequences for failure. Now some of us believe those _x000D_
consequences should be additional sanctions. While we are _x000D_
playing nice, however, Iran is playing an asymmetrical game, _x000D_
violating, in my view, the spirit and intent of sanctions._x000D_
    In November, Iran violated the interim agreement by feeding _x000D_
uranium gas into its IR-5 centrifuge at the Natanz research _x000D_
facility. The issue of whether this was a violation of the _x000D_
interim agreement is only an issue because at the time of the _x000D_
interim agreement the IR-5 had not been used for enrichment, _x000D_
and hence, the agreement only prohibited Iran from making _x000D_
advances on the IR-6. That is spin if I have ever heard it._x000D_
    But in any case, the action clearly violated the intent of _x000D_
the agreement to halt enrichment advances at Natanz, and it _x000D_
violated IAEA and U.N. Security Council resolutions. And it is _x000D_
interesting to note, as we are talking about verification _x000D_
agreements--should we be able to get an agreement--that it was _x000D_
a group of scientists outside of the administration that _x000D_
noticed this and were the ones to inform the administration _x000D_
about it. So that makes me worried about our verification _x000D_
processes moving forward._x000D_
    In December, the U.N. Panel of Experts that monitor _x000D_
sanctions compliance said in a report that Iran has been _x000D_
illicitly trying to buy technology for the Arak research _x000D_
reactor, which, as originally designed, would produce plutonium _x000D_
for a bomb and has been referred to by experts as a bombmaking _x000D_
factory because of the quantity of plutonium output._x000D_
    Under the interim agreement, Iran agreed to make no further _x000D_
advances in the construction at Arak. Iran's position is that _x000D_
any purchases alone would not contravene the agreement, only _x000D_
new construction. Well, if you believe that, I have a reactor _x000D_
to sell to you._x000D_
    And just last week, Iranian President Rouhani announced _x000D_
that construction had begun on two new nuclear reactors at _x000D_
Bushehr. While not a technical violation of the Joint Plan of _x000D_
Action, the announcement is clearly intended to leverage _x000D_
further gains in the negotiation._x000D_
    And the very next day, the Iranian regime announced that _x000D_
Washington Post correspondent, Jason Rezaian, who has been in _x000D_
prison for 178 days, had been referred to the Revolutionary _x000D_
Court that handles sensitive national security cases. As The _x000D_
Washington Post said in a recent editorial, ``It's difficult to _x000D_
avoid the conclusion that Mr. Rezaian is being used as a human _x000D_
pawn in the regime's attempt to gain leverage in the _x000D_
negotiations.''_x000D_
    So we have this whole alternate track that the Iranians can _x000D_
cheat on, but because it is technically not in the Joint Plan _x000D_
of Action, well, we do not call them on it. That is a great--_x000D_
that is a great opportunity if you can get it--that you can _x000D_
advance your interests outside of the JPOA and ``not violate'' _x000D_
the JPOA._x000D_
    So let me close by saying Iran is clearly taking steps that _x000D_
can only be interpreted as provocative. Yet the administration _x000D_
appears willing to excuse away any connection between these _x000D_
developments and signs of Iran's bad faith in negotiations._x000D_
    It seems that we are allowing Iran to shuffle the deck and _x000D_
deal the cards in this negotiation and that we are playing _x000D_
dealer's choice. Frankly, that is not good enough._x000D_
    We need to get into the game._x000D_
    Now, up until now, Iran has not been motivated sufficiently _x000D_
to make tough decisions. And I hope there will be an agreement _x000D_
in March, but I also believe we need to make clear that there _x000D_
are consequences to no deal or to a bad deal, as Senator Corker _x000D_
is referring to, and I am intrigued by his most recent concept _x000D_
of his legislation._x000D_
    So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding the hearing, and I _x000D_
will look forward to hearing from our witnesses."
2924048,2924047,2924049,19201,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. I am not used _x000D_
to calling you that yet._x000D_
    And to the other members, I want to say we do not normally _x000D_
give those long comments on the front end. They are usually a _x000D_
little shorter. This is obviously one that evokes a lot of _x000D_
concern._x000D_
    We are going to be having--the committee will operate by _x000D_
early bird rule. If you are here when the gavel goes down, you _x000D_
will know what order you are in. We have watched people come in _x000D_
and sit and wait as other people come in and out._x000D_
    But in order to show we are not going to be totally rigid, _x000D_
I know that Senator Boxer has a meeting. We do not normally _x000D_
have other opening comments. She is not going to ask questions _x000D_
later. But since she has to go to another meeting, she wanted _x000D_
to say a couple of words on the front end, and I am going to _x000D_
allow her to do that._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924049,2924048,2924050,19201,1,"    Mr. Chairman, thank you for your generosity _x000D_
of spirit._x000D_
    Senator Inhofe called our organizational meeting for EPW _x000D_
down the hall, and I have to be there. And I so appreciate _x000D_
this._x000D_
    I want to thank both my chairman and ranking member now for _x000D_
this hearing. We are all here today with the same goal, and _x000D_
that is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But we _x000D_
have different thoughts about the best way to do that, and that _x000D_
is why this hearing is so critical. And we welcome the _x000D_
witnesses as well._x000D_
    Well, we have a historic opportunity to peacefully achieve _x000D_
this goal. And to me, it seems like you have got to give this _x000D_
diplomacy a chance to work. I think it is only common sense. As _x000D_
President Obama said, war should be a last resort, not a first _x000D_
resort. And a peaceful end to Iran's nuclear program, I _x000D_
believe, is in the best interests of America and in the best _x000D_
interests of our great ally Israel._x000D_
    And that is why I am concerned, and it is not partisan. I _x000D_
have a concern that reaches across party lines that some _x000D_
colleagues are pushing to enact new sanctions while our _x000D_
negotiators are still at the table. I do not believe that _x000D_
strengthens us. It does not strengthen our position at all, and _x000D_
these negotiations are going on right now._x000D_
    In fact, I think if we enacted that legislation, we would _x000D_
jeopardize a chance, a once-in-a-lifetime perhaps chance of _x000D_
having a far-reaching, final, comprehensive agreement, which we _x000D_
know is going to be hard. Our own President has said it is a _x000D_
50/50 chance. He is not, you know, wearing rose-colored glasses _x000D_
on the point._x000D_
    Our own intelligence community said, and I quote, ``New _x000D_
sanctions would undermine the prospects for a successful _x000D_
comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran.''_x000D_
    And passing new sanctions legislation would threaten the _x000D_
unity we have achieved with the world, and that is critical. I _x000D_
want to quote British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said _x000D_
last week, ``As a country that stands alongside America in _x000D_
these vital negotiations, that it is the opinion of the United _x000D_
Kingdom that further sanctions or further threat of sanctions _x000D_
at this point will not actually help to bring the talks to a _x000D_
successful conclusion, and they could fracture the _x000D_
international unity there which has been so valuable in _x000D_
presenting a united front to Iran.''_x000D_
    And I think a new sanctions bill would give Iran an excuse _x000D_
to walk away. I think it says to Iran, to the hardliners, you _x000D_
see you cannot really deal with America._x000D_
    Now in the end, they may not be able to, and we might not _x000D_
be able to either. It is all--life is about timing. We all know _x000D_
that. We ran. We got our seats because of timing. Everything is _x000D_
about timing, and this is not the time._x000D_
    So, in closing, let me say I oppose the legislation I have _x000D_
seen so far. I have not seen the new proposal. I look forward _x000D_
to seeing it. But I am working on legislation with Senator Paul _x000D_
to send a clear, unequivocal signal that Iran will be held _x000D_
accountable for its actions, and any failure to fulfill its _x000D_
commitments will be met by swift action by Congress._x000D_
    So our bill, in essence, would allow expedited _x000D_
consideration by Congress of legislation to reinstate waived or _x000D_
suspended sanctions against Iran if the President, in _x000D_
consultation with the intelligence community, determines that _x000D_
Iran has violated any existing nuclear agreement._x000D_
    Senator Paul and I are putting the final touches on this _x000D_
bill. We think it is a moderate proposal because I think we are _x000D_
going to see perhaps three options. One option, which would _x000D_
essentially do nothing but just have a series of findings, _x000D_
which I do not think goes far enough, and one that perhaps _x000D_
moves too quickly toward sanctions._x000D_
    So Senator Paul will be working on that with me, putting _x000D_
the finishing touches. We are very excited to share it with our _x000D_
chairman and ranking member._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, I thank you so much for this opportunity."
2924050,2924049,2924051,19201,1,"    Thank you. Thank you._x000D_
    Just to be clear before we move to the witnesses, there has _x000D_
been a lot of confusion about what this committee does and what _x000D_
the Banking Committee does. Any sanctions legislation it has _x000D_
been determined will be dealt with in the Banking Committee----"
2924051,2924050,2924052,19201,1,    Right.
2924052,2924051,2924053,19201,1,"    [continuing]. Because of the Treasury _x000D_
functions. So this committee, I think, will be looking at ways _x000D_
for Congress to weigh in. And one of those is just for us to _x000D_
approve, up or down, the final deal, which is what we do on _x000D_
every civil nuclear deal that comes our way. Certainly, this is _x000D_
of greater importance._x000D_
    But with that, I want to thank everyone for their comments. _x000D_
I want to move to the witnesses. Thank you for your patience._x000D_
    Our first witness is Tony Blinken, the Deputy Secretary of _x000D_
State. Mr. Blinken assumed his post after being confirmed by _x000D_
the Senate in December. He is a former Deputy National Security _x000D_
Adviser to the President and has previously served as the _x000D_
Democratic staff director of this committee from 2002 to 2008. _x000D_
Welcome back._x000D_
    Our second witness today is David Cohen, the Under _x000D_
Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. _x000D_
Mr. Cohen has been in his position since 2011 and has recently _x000D_
been appointed Deputy Director of the CIA. He has previously _x000D_
served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist _x000D_
Financing, where I think he has done an outstanding job._x000D_
    I want to thank you both for being here and sharing your _x000D_
thoughts and viewpoints with us today. We would remind you that _x000D_
your full statements, without objection, will be included in _x000D_
the record. If you could keep your remarks to around 5 minutes, _x000D_
we would appreciate it. I know there will be numbers of _x000D_
questions._x000D_
    So thank you again for being here. We look forward to your _x000D_
testimony."
2924053,2924052,2924054,19201,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Cohen, Mr. Blinken was very fulsome in his comments, _x000D_
about double over. If you could sort of keep it to 5, it would _x000D_
be good._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924054,2924053,2924055,19201,3,"    Thank you both._x000D_
    And again, I just want to make sure everybody understands _x000D_
this committee is not the committee that deals with sanctions. _x000D_
And I know that the witnesses certainly have the opportunity to _x000D_
say anything they wish in testimony._x000D_
    That is not the issue that is before us._x000D_
    I am sure you may get some questions about things other _x000D_
than Iran today, and people will use this venue for that. But I _x000D_
would just like to ask this question of Mr. Blinken. Do you _x000D_
believe Congress has any role at all to play in these _x000D_
negotiations? And with a short answer, if you would?"
2924055,2924054,2924056,19201,3,"    Well, thank you._x000D_
    I think one of the things that we all know is when the _x000D_
sanctions were put in place, we gave the administration some _x000D_
national security waivers, and you have utilized those. I think _x000D_
all of us also know that once you suspend these in more depth _x000D_
and you agree to do that with the P1+5, in essence, what is _x000D_
going to happen is the entire regime is going to fall apart._x000D_
    And so, I sent you some legislation--I am very disappointed _x000D_
you did not address that today in your opening comments--that _x000D_
would just allow us--we do not want to do something that _x000D_
infringes upon getting to a good deal. And so, we have sought _x000D_
to figure out some way for Congress to be able to weigh in _x000D_
before you dismantle, before you dismantle over a longer period _x000D_
of time with this national security waiver the entire regime._x000D_
    We have asked is it appropriate for us to at least be able _x000D_
to weigh in since we did, in fact, put those sanctions in _x000D_
place? So I will just ask you this. Do you believe that _x000D_
Congress should have the ability to vote up or down on any _x000D_
agreement in the same framework that we do with 123 agreements, _x000D_
which we have done 27 times on our civil deals? Do you not _x000D_
think this rises to that level of importance to our Nation? And _x000D_
would you oppose this body taking up legislation to deal with _x000D_
that in an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor?"
2924056,2924055,2924057,19201,3,"    So if I could, I think the answer is ``No.'' _x000D_
So let me--you know, we could easily deal with this by just _x000D_
passing legislation that does away with national security _x000D_
waivers. So----"
2924057,2924056,2924058,19201,3,"    So I do not understand. You know, you have _x000D_
talked about the sanctions piece. I have talked to our French _x000D_
negotiators directly. I talked to our U.K. negotiators _x000D_
directly. I talked to Prime Minister Cameron directly. I talked _x000D_
last night at length in my office to the negotiator on behalf _x000D_
of the European Union._x000D_
    I was in Israel this weekend, talked to the intelligence _x000D_
agencies there. I talked to the Prime Minister. I have met no _x000D_
one who believes that us weighing in would do anything to _x000D_
destabilize these negotiations. As a matter of fact, many have _x000D_
said knowing that Congress has to approve the deal would be a _x000D_
great backstop for the administration to strengthen their hand, _x000D_
just as the negotiators in Iran continue to refer to the _x000D_
hardliners and to Khamenei, the spiritual--the leader, the _x000D_
Supreme Leader._x000D_
    And I do not understand why--I mean, again, we could just _x000D_
do away. We were generous in the passage of these sanctions _x000D_
giving you a security waiver. We could actually just do away _x000D_
with that, and you would have to come to us._x000D_
    So why would you oppose Congress weighing in on an issue of _x000D_
this importance? And is it hollow for you to say that you want _x000D_
this to pass muster or Secretary Kerry to say this should pass _x000D_
muster and yet continue to stiff-arm, every effort to be pushed _x000D_
away. Congress, who represents more fully this Nation than the _x000D_
negotiators, not having the ability to weigh in on this deal."
2924058,2924057,2924059,19201,3,"    Does the Iranian Parliament not need to weigh _x000D_
in on some of the agreements that Iran is putting in place?"
2924059,2924058,2924060,19201,3,"    Okay. So, so on one hand, we would negotiate _x000D_
in such a way as we know that the Supreme Leader could try to _x000D_
influence the Iranian Parliament to go against what they may _x000D_
agree to, and yet you would say here it is not important for _x000D_
the greatest deliberative body in the world to be able to weigh _x000D_
in on this issue._x000D_
    Matter of fact, the body that actually put together this _x000D_
regime that the entire international community is building _x000D_
these negotiations off of."
2924060,2924059,2924061,19201,3,"    Well, my time is up. But I would support a _x000D_
series of votes, if that is what you are saying. I would _x000D_
support an initial vote on the deal as a whole, and I think _x000D_
Congress would be more than glad to work with you on a series _x000D_
of votes as you move along._x000D_
    I will say, Mr. Blinken, after having served on this _x000D_
committee, and after you all spending incredible amounts of _x000D_
time dissing the sanctions regime, which we are not focused on, _x000D_
we are trying to find a constructive way for Congress to play _x000D_
its rightful role in these negotiations. And I am very _x000D_
disappointed that, in essence, what the administration is _x000D_
saying is we really do not want--even though Congress put us in _x000D_
this place, we really do not want Congress to play a role in _x000D_
one of the most important geopolitical agreements that may take _x000D_
place during this administration._x000D_
    With that, Ranking Member Menendez."
2924061,2924060,2924062,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    You know, I have to be honest with you. The more I hear _x000D_
from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like _x000D_
talking points that come straight out of Tehran. And it feeds _x000D_
into the Iranian narrative of victimization when they are the _x000D_
ones with original sin--an illicit nuclear weapons program _x000D_
going back over the course of 20 years that they are unwilling _x000D_
to come clean on._x000D_
    So I do not know why we feel compelled to make their case _x000D_
when, in fact, do you dispute any of the things I said in my _x000D_
opening statement about actions that they have taken as it _x000D_
relates to the U.N. monitors, as it relates to fueling that _x000D_
rod, as it relates to those other elements? Do you dispute any _x000D_
of those? Just yes or no."
2924062,2924061,2924063,19201,3,"    Okay. So then the bottom line is they get _x000D_
to cheat in a series of--I will call it cheat. You will not. _x000D_
But they get to cheat in a series of ways and we get to worry _x000D_
about their perceptions. To quote from your testimony, and I _x000D_
will quote directly, ``Even if such sanctions are not arguably _x000D_
a technical violation of the Joint Plan of Action, we believe _x000D_
they would be perceived as such by Iran.''_x000D_
    Now, so we are worried about their perceptions, but our _x000D_
perceptions of what they are doing to advance their nuclear _x000D_
interests can be just clearly swept underneath the rug. And I _x000D_
also think it is important, reading from your testimony, to put _x000D_
the Joint Plan of Action in the appropriate context._x000D_
    You say, ``Instead of limiting work on advanced _x000D_
centrifuges,'' referring to Iran, ``it could resume its efforts _x000D_
to increase and significantly improve its nuclear capabilities _x000D_
in a relatively short timeframe.'' So let us be honest about _x000D_
what the Joint Place of Action is. It is a freeze. It is a _x000D_
freeze that scientists that have come before this committee _x000D_
have said if they, in fact, decide to proceed and not make a _x000D_
deal, they need about 3 months._x000D_
    Now what, what--Mr. Chairman, I do not know that members of _x000D_
the audience get to participate here. But they need about 3 _x000D_
months._x000D_
    Now I am not a scientist, but I will accept their testimony _x000D_
as pretty much substantive as to where they need to go. Any _x000D_
sanctions that we have imposed have taken a minimum 6 months to _x000D_
give lead time to the world and to companies that this is now a _x000D_
sanctionable item. So that puts us beyond the timeframe if they _x000D_
make a decision to move in a different direction._x000D_
    And let us be honest that at one time maybe, but now the _x000D_
Iranians do not believe that there is a credible use of _x000D_
military force on the table, should they not make a deal and _x000D_
should they move to break through on nuclear capabilities for _x000D_
weaponization. So, you know, you are telling the committee _x000D_
then, and you can look us straight in the eye and say that _x000D_
prospective sanctions that do not take place until July--well _x000D_
after the period of time of not just a framework--because I _x000D_
have never been able to get my hands around your March _x000D_
framework, what that really means._x000D_
    I have been told there is not even going to be a written _x000D_
document to that effect. A March framework, that takes place in _x000D_
July after a deal has either been consummated or not and would _x000D_
only take place if a deal has not been consummated and even _x000D_
with Presidential waivers at that period of time, is somehow _x000D_
going to make the Ayatollah walk away from a deal that he _x000D_
thinks is in his country's or his best interest to have anyhow._x000D_
    That is tough to believe in. It is just--it defies common _x000D_
sense that if I want to make a deal that something you are _x000D_
going to do that does not affect my ability to make that deal _x000D_
is going to make me walk away from a deal that I find is in my _x000D_
interest anyhow. That is just not common sense._x000D_
    So I get that you are all hung up on the sanctions thing, _x000D_
and I get that there is--you know, you talk about perception, _x000D_
that it is not necessarily a violation, but it will be _x000D_
perceived as such. So we have to worry about all of the Iranian _x000D_
perceptions, but we can just swallow all of what they are doing _x000D_
independently._x000D_
    So let me ask you this: Is it not true that even the deal _x000D_
that you are striving toward is not to eliminate any Iranian _x000D_
breakout capability, but to constrain the time in which you _x000D_
will get the notice of such breakout capability? Is that a fair _x000D_
statement? Yes or no."
2924063,2924062,2924064,19201,3,"    Okay. So we are not eliminating Iran's _x000D_
ability to break out. We are just getting alarm bells, and the _x000D_
question is how long are we going to get those alarm bells for?_x000D_
    Now is it not also true that the administration cannot lift _x000D_
sanctions, that it can only waive them under the present law? _x000D_
Yes or no."
2924064,2924063,2924065,19201,3,"    So now the Iranians are going to make a _x000D_
deal in which this President may waive sanctions, but the next _x000D_
President of the United States, whoever that may be, may _x000D_
decide, you know what, this is not in our interests because it _x000D_
is only going to give us a limited period of time. And they are _x000D_
going to go ahead and say, sorry, we are not waiving the _x000D_
sanctions anymore._x000D_
    And that, the Iranians are willing to make the hard _x000D_
decisions that they need to make, that they have been unwilling _x000D_
to make for 18 months because I heard--this movie has been _x000D_
played before, right, 20 years. Last June, we heard from the _x000D_
President ``just give me time.'' That was 7 months ago, right? _x000D_
Now we are reliving it again._x000D_
    And so, the bottom line is that we are going to do all of _x000D_
this and ultimately be in a position in which if they do not _x000D_
make a deal, we are exactly where we were at, but with no _x000D_
immediate consequences to them. Their breakout time is shorter _x000D_
than the time it will take to create new sanctions. And now you _x000D_
are telling me and the chairman, based upon your responses, _x000D_
that you do not want us to even vote._x000D_
    The Iranians have made it very clear that their Parliament _x000D_
has to vote on this issue. Why is it possible that Tehran will _x000D_
treat its Parliament better than the administration in the _x000D_
greatest democracy in the world is willing to treat its _x000D_
Congress? It just boggles my imagination._x000D_
    So, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to looking at your _x000D_
legislation. I have suggested to you in our previous _x000D_
conversations some ways in which I think it might be made even _x000D_
stronger. And I appreciate that this is one of our first _x000D_
hearings."
2924065,2924064,2924066,19201,3,"    Senator Menendez, I appreciate your _x000D_
willingness to look at some legislation that would give us an _x000D_
up-or-down vote on this issue. And I would say in response to _x000D_
Mr. Blinken's comments, I have talked with our international _x000D_
partners. Not a single one of them has any concerns whatsoever _x000D_
with Congress having the ability to vote up or down on a final _x000D_
deal._x000D_
    Many of them believe it strengthens our hand. So, with _x000D_
that, Mr. Gardner--Senator Gardner."
2924066,2924065,2924067,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And Secretary Blinken, I do not want to mischaracterize _x000D_
anything that you have said in your response to Chairman _x000D_
Corker. So I want to clarify perhaps a comment that I heard _x000D_
wrong._x000D_
    You mentioned that in the discussion the possibility of _x000D_
legislation that the chairman has sent over to you, the _x000D_
possibility of that legislation undermining the credibility of _x000D_
our negotiators. Could you expound on that comment? And is that _x000D_
what you, indeed, said?"
2924067,2924066,2924068,19201,3,"    And have you heard from any of our _x000D_
partners around the world that they believe this legislation _x000D_
would undermine the credibility of our negotiators?"
2924068,2924067,2924069,19201,3,    It had been fairly----
2924069,2924068,2924070,19201,3,"    I mean, it has been fairly public in terms _x000D_
of news reports about the proposed legislation, the ideas that _x000D_
we would put forward. No one--this is strictly the _x000D_
administration's position and none of our partners?"
2924070,2924069,2924071,19201,3,"    You mentioned talk about the Iran not _x000D_
being immune to politics. And so, following up on President _x000D_
Rouhani, does he have the support within the Iranian _x000D_
Government, within the politics within Iran, to accept an _x000D_
agreement from the United States and the international _x000D_
community, regardless of how flexible the United States is and _x000D_
the international community with sanctions during the--during _x000D_
negotiations?"
2924071,2924070,2924072,19201,3,"    And going back to the JPOA, do you believe _x000D_
the Corker legislation would violate the intent of the JPOA?"
2924072,2924071,2924073,19201,3,"    So, again, it would not violate the intent _x000D_
of the JPOA, but would it give us the ability to weigh in as _x000D_
Congress, the ability to perform advise and consent obligations _x000D_
under our Constitution. So it is strictly the administration's _x000D_
concern that this would interfere with their negotiations?"
2924073,2924072,2924074,19201,3,"    And by all accounts, Iran remains a state _x000D_
sponsor of terror and one of the world's foremost violators of _x000D_
human rights. These discussions have been involving the regime _x000D_
on nuclear issues._x000D_
    The regime's record as a state sponsor of terrorism and _x000D_
human rights continues to be abysmal. But if the refusal to _x000D_
impose additional sanctions while we discuss the nuclear _x000D_
issues, would you support additional sanctions that target the _x000D_
regime in areas of terrorism and human rights violations?"
2924074,2924073,2924075,19201,3,"    Mr. Chairman, thank you."
2924075,2924074,2924076,19201,3,"    Thank you, and we would certainly love input, _x000D_
love engagement like you are doing with Iran. We would like the _x000D_
same respect. So if you have some details you would like to _x000D_
talk with us about, that would be fine._x000D_
    Senator Markey."
2924076,2924075,2924077,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much._x000D_
    Now I have heard that the right agreement here includes a _x000D_
1-year breakout period. A duration of 15 to 20 years would be _x000D_
the agreement. Now the Arak reactor would be neutralized, and _x000D_
there would be a full-scope safeguards under the additional _x000D_
protocol. Those are the highlights, the way I understand it._x000D_
    Are the Iranians willing to give up the heavy water reactor _x000D_
at Arak?"
2924077,2924076,2924078,19201,3,"    Have they agreed to take Arak's heavy water _x000D_
processing capacity off the table?"
2924078,2924077,2924079,19201,3,"    They have not. And on Fordow, your _x000D_
testimony pointed out that before the JPOA, Iran had about 200 _x000D_
kilograms of 20 percent enriched uranium in a form that could _x000D_
quickly be enriched into a weapons-grade level. And it produced _x000D_
much of the material at the Fordow facility. You say they no _x000D_
longer have that capacity._x000D_
    What do the Iranians then expect to do with their civilian _x000D_
nuclear sites, specifically the underground facility at Fordow, _x000D_
under the agreement that you are negotiating right now?"
2924079,2924078,2924080,19201,3,"    Okay. Now I wrote a book back in 1982 on _x000D_
the International Atomic Energy Agency, and I concluded at the _x000D_
time that it was a paper tiger in terms of its ability to put _x000D_
in place the kinds of intrusive inspections that would ensure _x000D_
that there was not a breakout. And so, what I would like to do _x000D_
here is just to give you a chance just to talk about the _x000D_
inspections regime that other countries abide by and what Iran _x000D_
is now negotiating._x000D_
    So right now, 122 countries have agreed to allow the IAEA _x000D_
to inspect nuclear sites any time they want, with as little as _x000D_
2 hours advance notice. Can you tell us a little bit then about _x000D_
what the IAEA inspectors can do in terms of visiting Fordow and _x000D_
Natanz and other facilities if they want to go in with no _x000D_
notice, essentially, which is what the other 122 countries _x000D_
allow to happen?"
2924080,2924079,2924081,19201,3,"    So what are they telling you about Parchin _x000D_
right now?"
2924081,2924080,2924082,19201,3,"    Is it their willingness to allow for IAEA _x000D_
inspectors to go into that site?"
2924082,2924081,2924083,19201,3,"    Yes, I think it is very important for the _x000D_
United States to understand exactly what will be the level of _x000D_
intrusiveness into each one of these sites._x000D_
    And finally, although there are so many things that we can _x000D_
talk about here, it has been reported that both Saudi Arabia _x000D_
and Jordan are interested in pursuing nuclear cooperation _x000D_
agreements with the United States. How will we be able to _x000D_
convince those countries to agree not to demand the right to _x000D_
enrich uranium as part of those agreements if we allow Iran to _x000D_
continue to maintain its enrichment capability as part of a _x000D_
final agreement?_x000D_
    And I put that in the context of the 123 agreement, and the _x000D_
chairman already referred to this, the 123 agreement with the _x000D_
United Arab Emirates, which, again, I thought was a mistake, as _x000D_
I think a mistake would be made if we had an agreement with _x000D_
Saudi Arabia, for example. It just will trigger a proliferation _x000D_
cascading effect if there is not kind of a sense that there is _x000D_
equal treatment._x000D_
    So could you talk about that little bit as well?"
2924083,2924082,2924084,19201,3,"    I think it is very important for us to go _x000D_
to the next step in terms of what is the reaction of Saudi _x000D_
Arabia if Iran has this capability."
2924084,2924083,2924085,19201,3,"    We can pursue this further, but again, I _x000D_
think a no enrichment policy is the correct policy, especially _x000D_
as it sets a precedent for Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, _x000D_
and others and especially since the Iranians are clearly _x000D_
intending on building 8 to 10 nuclear power plants as they are _x000D_
flaring 10 nuclear power plants' worth of nuclear electricity _x000D_
generating capacity on a daily basis._x000D_
    Okay? So we just have to understand fully what the long-_x000D_
term implications are._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924085,2924084,2924086,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Barrasso."
2924086,2924085,2924087,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Secretary Cohen, in a meeting in the White House last week, _x000D_
the President said he thought the chances of a deal are about--_x000D_
well, were less than 50 percent, and I mean, you said exactly _x000D_
the same thing today._x000D_
    You know, when you look at odds like that, I think it is _x000D_
important for us to take into consideration the high _x000D_
possibility that this does not succeed and what we need to do _x000D_
in case an agreement is not received--is not able to come out. _x000D_
So you had said that if there is not a deal, that the Congress _x000D_
and this administration would move quickly to enact new _x000D_
sanctions if Iran were to walk away from the talks._x000D_
    So could you talk about some specific additional sanctions _x000D_
that you think the administration would at least support _x000D_
imposing on Iran if the diplomatic talks fall apart and nothing _x000D_
is achieved?"
2924087,2924086,2924088,19201,3,"    You make the point where you say, well, _x000D_
those are things we would be interested in exploring._x000D_
    And so, then the question naturally leads to is, how long _x000D_
would it actually take until sanctions were imposed that would _x000D_
actually have a meaningful impact on what is happening?"
2924088,2924087,2924089,19201,3,"    And since the combined impact of _x000D_
sanctions not just by the United States, but by others has an _x000D_
initial impact on the ground, have there been these discussions _x000D_
with P5+1 about the imposing sanctions across the board that _x000D_
would snap back into place?"
2924089,2924088,2924090,19201,3,"    A number of us have just come back from _x000D_
Saudi Arabia, from Qatar, from Israel, have visited with _x000D_
members of the Free Syrian Army. And this has to do with what _x000D_
happens when sanction relief occurs and where the money is _x000D_
spent. It goes to Iran._x000D_
    What we have heard from the commanders on the ground of the _x000D_
Free Syrian Army is that when the sanctions were relieved in _x000D_
the past, money went into Iran, which then immediately went to _x000D_
help finance efforts with Assad in Syria. That Assad, at this _x000D_
point, is buying oil and food staples from ISIS. So an indirect _x000D_
funding through Assad to ISIS._x000D_
    And I am just wondering how this all impacts and how you _x000D_
see what is happening there on the ground, at least what we _x000D_
have heard on our overseas trip and visiting with the Free _x000D_
Syrian Army?"
2924090,2924089,2924091,19201,3,"    Thank you. And because, obviously, Hamas, _x000D_
Hezbollah, all of those----"
2924091,2924090,2924092,19201,3,"    Mr. Blinken, if I could visit with you _x000D_
about regional proliferation. The other thing that we had heard _x000D_
that, and I think Senator Markey talked about, if Iran is able _x000D_
to proliferate, who else can do it and what the other issues _x000D_
and interests are going to be._x000D_
    I mean, we heard that Saudi Arabia is going to be _x000D_
interested in pursuing either a development program or perhaps _x000D_
even purchasing nuclear weapons from Pakistan. And I am just--_x000D_
there is that concern that this could result in actually _x000D_
instead of eliminating nuclear arms in the area, resulting in _x000D_
an escalation in a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Could _x000D_
you comment on that?"
2924092,2924091,2924093,19201,3,"    Well, I would just say as a final _x000D_
thought, I agree completely with you. If Iran has a nuclear _x000D_
weapon, that will happen. The question is if they are allowed _x000D_
to enrich uranium at a level that far exceeds what they really _x000D_
need for energy use. And there is a mathematical calculation or _x000D_
how much they need for the number of energy plus the potential _x000D_
of how much they want to enrich, how many centrifuges are _x000D_
involved, and the concern that even the approval of that could _x000D_
result in this additional proliferation and arms race."
2924093,2924092,2924094,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924094,2924093,2924095,19201,3,"    Thank you. I understand that Senator Purdue _x000D_
has deferred to Senator Johnson for time reasons._x000D_
    I would say to the audience we very much appreciate you _x000D_
being here and listening. We do not appreciate being involved _x000D_
in the dialogue. So if you could keep comments to yourself._x000D_
    And with that, I am sorry, I am going to the wrong side _x000D_
here, I guess, Senator Murphy."
2924095,2924094,2924096,19201,3,"    Thank you very much, Senator Corker._x000D_
    Congratulations on assuming the chairmanship. I know you _x000D_
and Senator Menendez have had a very constructive working _x000D_
relationship over the last 2 years, and I trust that will _x000D_
continue._x000D_
    I wanted to accept your invitation and focus some of my _x000D_
questions on the jurisdiction of this committee and then maybe _x000D_
sneak in the last question on sanctions._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, as you know, I have been one of the strongest _x000D_
proponents of Congress exercising its constitutional authority _x000D_
and responsibility when it comes to being coequal with the _x000D_
executive branch with respect to the management of foreign _x000D_
affairs. That is why I think it is absolutely essential, a _x000D_
requirement that this committee continue our work on AUMF._x000D_
    The Constitution spells out very clearly that it is our _x000D_
responsibility to declare war, and thus, we need to weigh in on _x000D_
what is happening today in Syria and Iraq. But the Constitution _x000D_
is also equally clear as to when the Congress has the _x000D_
responsibility to weigh in on international agreements entered _x000D_
into on behalf of the United States by the Executive, and there _x000D_
is a longstanding precedent on what constitutes a treaty _x000D_
requiring the U.S. Congress to weigh in and what constitutes a _x000D_
nontreaty obligation entered into by the Executive._x000D_
    And I think it is important for us to understand the _x000D_
difference between the two because I accept the caution that _x000D_
Secretary Blinken made to us about a new precedent that we _x000D_
might be setting about weighing in on this agreement and what _x000D_
it would mean for future agreements. And I also worry about our _x000D_
ability, just in the current political context, to have a _x000D_
reasonable, productive debate on an international agreement of _x000D_
this import._x000D_
    The fact is, is that we cannot even approve a treaty _x000D_
recognizing disability rights. We have an agreement on illegal _x000D_
arms trafficking that was opposed only by Iran, North Korea, _x000D_
and Syria at its inception, and we cannot even begin a _x000D_
discussion about that treaty here. And so, I worry about our _x000D_
ability to process this._x000D_
    But I do understand the concerns that the chairman is _x000D_
raising. And so, I want to maybe direct a few questions to our _x000D_
witnesses about the concerns._x000D_
    The first is that a suspension of sanctions as part of an _x000D_
agreement with the Iranians has the effect of being a permanent _x000D_
end to the sanctions, thus essentially effectively eliminating _x000D_
our ability to weigh in with a statutory removal of the _x000D_
sanctions. So I guess I will ask Secretary Cohen this question._x000D_
    Do you believe that if an agreement was reached that led to _x000D_
a suspension of the sanctions, that that would be an effective _x000D_
unraveling of the sanctions? Or do you believe that if the _x000D_
Iranians did not live up to the early stages of that agreement, _x000D_
we would have the ability to put back in place sanctions that _x000D_
were suspended?_x000D_
    I think it is a legitimate concern that Senator Corker is _x000D_
raising, and it would be good to hear your thoughts."
2924096,2924095,2924097,19201,3,"    And there was a legitimate concern raised _x000D_
about the JPOA that did not end up coming true. People said _x000D_
that this would be unraveling of the sanctions, and I think _x000D_
even our loudest critics now accept that those sanctions can be _x000D_
reinstituted because they have held together._x000D_
    Secretary Blinken, just talk about what happens within the _x000D_
P5+1 if we reach an agreement that our partners are _x000D_
enthusiastic about, that they are able to get domestic support _x000D_
for, and then the Congress disapproves it. What happens in that _x000D_
situation in which we have an agreement that our partners have _x000D_
consented to and the administration has consented to, but _x000D_
Congress rejects?"
2924097,2924096,2924098,19201,3,"    Secretary Blinken, one question on _x000D_
sanctions. As a potential tool at the negotiating table, _x000D_
consider a resolution from the U.S. Congress stating our clear _x000D_
intent upon the failure of negotiations to reach fruition to _x000D_
enact the kind of crippling sanctions that we are all beginning _x000D_
a discussion about today._x000D_
    Clearly, it would be nonbinding but would put the majority _x000D_
of the Senate on record, stating our intention to move very _x000D_
quickly and expeditiously with sanctions. Would that resolution _x000D_
be a violation of the JPOA, and would it be helpful to your _x000D_
negotiating position over the course of the next few months?"
2924098,2924097,2924099,19201,3,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
2924099,2924098,2924100,19201,3,    Senator Johnson.
2924100,2924099,2924101,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    I would like to thank Senator Purdue for switching _x000D_
positions with me here._x000D_
    Mr. Blinken, in reviewing U.N. Security Council _x000D_
resolutions, the goal, or certainly a requirement of U.N. _x000D_
Resolution 1696, was to ask or call for Iran to suspend _x000D_
enrichment of uranium; 1737, same requirement, suspend _x000D_
enrichment; 1747 stated that the nuclear program must be _x000D_
verified as only peaceful, and I will come back to that. _x000D_
Resolution 1803, Iran must halt its enrichment; 1835 basically _x000D_
reaffirmed the previous four U.N. resolutions. Then, 1929 again _x000D_
calls for the halt of enrichment by Iran._x000D_
    At what point in time did we abandon that requirement?"
2924101,2924100,2924102,19201,3,"    Again, it is a pretty simple question. _x000D_
When did we abandon the goal of not allowing them to enrich _x000D_
uranium?"
2924102,2924101,2924103,19201,3,"    In the JPOA, basically, we abandoned that. _x000D_
Correct?"
2924103,2924102,2924104,19201,3,"    Mr. Cohen, in your testimony, you said _x000D_
there is no higher priority than to prevent Iran from obtaining _x000D_
a nuclear weapon. And you said the goal of the negotiation was _x000D_
to, and I believe this is your quote, ``guarantee that Iran _x000D_
cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.''_x000D_
    As long as they are enriching uranium how can you possibly _x000D_
guarantee that they will not obtain a nuclear weapon?"
2924104,2924103,2924105,19201,3,"    That would be military action then. So, in _x000D_
other words, give ourselves enough time to conduct military _x000D_
action so they cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. Is that _x000D_
basically the administration's policy?"
2924105,2924104,2924106,19201,3,"    We have had testimony before this _x000D_
committee on how incredibly expensive it is to enrich uranium _x000D_
and also that, if you have a peaceful nuclear program, there is _x000D_
absolutely no reason to enrich uranium because you can obtain _x000D_
it readily in the open market. Is that not correct?"
2924106,2924105,2924107,19201,3,"    With that in mind, Mr. Blinken, you said _x000D_
earlier that you cannot imagine that any other country would _x000D_
subject themselves to the isolation, the sanctions, the harm to _x000D_
its economy that Iran is subjecting itself to. So let me just _x000D_
ask a simple question. Why is Iran subjecting itself to the _x000D_
isolation, the sanctions, and the harm to the economy if it _x000D_
were not other than to obtain a nuclear weapon?"
2924107,2924106,2924108,19201,3,"    Again, which they could obtain the _x000D_
material----"
2924108,2924107,2924109,19201,3,"    So, again, is the answer not obvious? They _x000D_
can make this pain go away tomorrow. They could end the _x000D_
isolation. They could end the sanctions. They could improve _x000D_
their economy by just suspending, ending, halting their nuclear _x000D_
enrichment program, but they are not doing that."
2924109,2924108,2924110,19201,3,    So how do we ever----
2924110,2924109,2924111,19201,3,"    One final question. Why does the President _x000D_
of the United States believe he is the sole person, the only _x000D_
representative of the United States that can actually decide _x000D_
whether or not the deal with Iran is a good deal or a bad deal _x000D_
for our entire Nation? Why does the President believe he is the _x000D_
only person who should have that authority? Why does he not _x000D_
believe that this is really more like a treaty that would _x000D_
require ratification by Congress?"
2924111,2924110,2924112,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2924112,2924111,2924113,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Kaine."
2924113,2924112,2924114,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you to the witnesses._x000D_
    I have been a strong supporter of the administration's _x000D_
diplomatic efforts with Iran and the P5+1. We all share the _x000D_
goal of an Iran with no nuclear weapons, and the termination of _x000D_
any such intent diplomatically rather than militarily is _x000D_
preferable to everyone._x000D_
    I think the JPOA has been a success. There were those who _x000D_
predicted it would lead to an unraveling of the sanctions _x000D_
regime. It did not. There were those who predicted it would _x000D_
lead to a surge in the Iranian economy. It did not._x000D_
    There were those who predicted that Iran would not meet its _x000D_
obligations under the JPOA, and they largely have. And I am _x000D_
sure in Iran, there were those predicting the United States _x000D_
would not meet our obligations under the JPOA, and we have._x000D_
    I think skeptics at the origin now realize that the JPOA _x000D_
has largely been successful._x000D_
    With respect to a final deal, I have a series of very _x000D_
significant concerns. First, a deep skepticism about Iran. _x000D_
Within the last 48 hours, the United States has had to position _x000D_
ships in the Red Sea to potentially engage in an evacuation of _x000D_
the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a, a very, very serious contingency _x000D_
that is likely enough that we have had to position military _x000D_
assets there. All understand that the Houthi effort to topple _x000D_
the government in Yemen has been supported and funded through _x000D_
Tehran._x000D_
    Tehran has basically turned the Assad regime into a puppet _x000D_
state. They have done that in Iraq for years. They are _x000D_
currently involved in activities to destabilize the governments _x000D_
of nations as near as Bahrain and as far away as Morocco. So _x000D_
separate and apart from this nuclear negotiation, Iran is _x000D_
engaged in activity today that should make us be deeply _x000D_
skeptical about their intentions._x000D_
    Second, I am worried about the negotiation and the _x000D_
potential consequences of it. The United States was engaged in _x000D_
a negotiation with Libya over the dismantling of their nuclear _x000D_
program, and they gave up their nuclear weapons. Now Libya is _x000D_
no good example for anything now, but imagine the chaos of _x000D_
Libya if the weapons had survived. We were involved in a deal, _x000D_
and it dismantled their weapons program._x000D_
    The United States was involved in a nuclear negotiation _x000D_
with North Korea where we asked them to to freeze their _x000D_
program. They cheated, and they have nuclear weapons now._x000D_
    I want this deal to look more like the deal with Libya, a _x000D_
dismantlement, than trying to make a deal about, well, let us _x000D_
just freeze it for a while with a nation that has proven to be _x000D_
very untrustworthy. Because I think if it is only that kind of _x000D_
a deal, the end result is more likely to be the North Korean _x000D_
situation._x000D_
    Iran has made it pretty plain in the course of this JPOA _x000D_
negotiation. This is now not a negotiation about Iran _x000D_
dismantling a nuclear weapons program. It is a negotiation _x000D_
about trying to buy a year of time, to have an alarm bell ring _x000D_
and then for us to act._x000D_
    So we are already going down a path in this negotiation, in _x000D_
my view, where it is more like the Korea--it is more like the _x000D_
Korean scenario than the Libyan scenario._x000D_
    The number of centrifuges that are being contemplated. I _x000D_
have a different point of view than Senator Johnson. Some _x000D_
residual enrichment capacity by Iran does not trouble me, and _x000D_
that could be part of the deal. But it would have to be a _x000D_
capacity that is consistent only with a civilian nuclear _x000D_
program and not civilian plus a whole lot more that could only _x000D_
be used for a weaponry program._x000D_
    And the kinds of things I have been hearing from the _x000D_
negotiating team about the number of centrifuges contemplated _x000D_
in this deal, this is not consistent with a purely civilian _x000D_
program._x000D_
    And finally, the point that was made by I think it was _x000D_
Senator Gardner or, no, Senator Barrasso, this is going to _x000D_
trigger an arms race in the region. Our allies and others who _x000D_
are not our allies are telling us this._x000D_
    And if all we get with a deal like this is Iran agreeing _x000D_
to, well, we will give you a year before we break out, then _x000D_
other nations are going to start trying to say, okay, I got to _x000D_
be able to have nuclear capacity within a year. They are going _x000D_
to have to engage in those behaviors. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, _x000D_
Egypt, if it is just a year we are buying, they will undertake _x000D_
similar activity._x000D_
    I think Congress has to weigh in on a final deal. I support _x000D_
the JPOA. I support the administration's diplomacy, but I think _x000D_
we have to weigh in. And the reason we have to, and I _x000D_
understood Senator Murphy's point, constitutional. He is right _x000D_
about many such deals, but he is not right, I do not think, _x000D_
about this deal._x000D_
    Because this deal is fundamentally about one thing on our _x000D_
side. Under what conditions will a congressionally imposed _x000D_
sanctions regime be dismantled?_x000D_
    If the administration was negotiating about other things _x000D_
and saying we are not going to touch the congressionally _x000D_
imposed sanctions regime at all, then congressional approval _x000D_
would not be warranted. But there is no condition under which _x000D_
you are going to bring a deal back that does not involve Iran _x000D_
wanting relief from congressional sanctions._x000D_
    And so, since this deal is fundamentally the only real _x000D_
lever we have is the congressionally designed sanctions regime, _x000D_
effectively implemented by the administration that has brought _x000D_
it around to the table, the only lever in this negotiation is _x000D_
the congressionally imposed sanctions regime. And I do not _x000D_
think that the--while limited waivers were certainly _x000D_
contemplated, I do not think a blanket suspension for a period _x000D_
of time was contemplated by that language._x000D_
    And so, I do think it is very important for Congress to be _x000D_
able to weigh in onto this deal, especially given the actor _x000D_
that we are dealing with._x000D_
    Now a couple of quick questions. How confident are you, for _x000D_
either of you, that the United States or the IAEA can detect _x000D_
clandestine nuclear sites? I understand newer and newer _x000D_
iterations of technology required or acquired are harder to _x000D_
detect. How confident are you on that, and talk about the way _x000D_
you are approaching the inspection especially of clandestine _x000D_
sites in this negotiation."
2924114,2924113,2924115,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924115,2924114,2924116,19201,3,"    Very good. Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Purdue."
2924116,2924115,2924117,19201,3,"    Thank you. Thank you very much._x000D_
    Senator Shaheen."
2924117,2924116,2924118,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thank you both for being here._x000D_
    You know, Deputy Secretary Blinken, I certainly share the _x000D_
view that it is important for us to keep our coalition together _x000D_
if we are going to be successful. And one concern that I have _x000D_
is to what extent we are going to be able to do that, given _x000D_
what is happening with Russia. And so, I wonder if you could _x000D_
talk a little bit about what Russia is doing today?_x000D_
    There is a notice of an agreement that Iran and Russia have _x000D_
just signed, and you know, clearly, the sanctions that we have _x000D_
taken against Russia over Ukraine seems like it is going to _x000D_
have an impact on what is happening with Iran. So can you talk _x000D_
about Russia's willingness to continue to be part of this _x000D_
effort and to what extent we are seeing their commitment being _x000D_
reduced or not?"
2924118,2924117,2924119,19201,3,"    Well, if you would, talk a little bit more _x000D_
about that because one of the things that I thought was very _x000D_
telling was when Russia canceled the missile deal with Iran _x000D_
several years ago. And we have got Putin, I was just in an _x000D_
Armed Services Committee hearing upstairs where Dr. Brzezinski, _x000D_
former National Security Adviser, talked about Putin's comments _x000D_
around using nuclear weapons during this Ukraine conflict and _x000D_
suggesting that that might be a possibility at some point._x000D_
    So, you know, can you--to what extent do we believe that _x000D_
Russia continues to be very concerned about Iran developing a _x000D_
nuclear weapon, and how is what is happening in Ukraine _x000D_
affecting that?"
2924119,2924118,2924120,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Can you also--shortly after the JPOA was negotiated, there _x000D_
was a lot of noise in some of the European capitals about trade _x000D_
deals with Iran and trade delegations that were being sent to _x000D_
Iran. Can you talk about what is happening to date, if any of _x000D_
those have successfully negotiated any deals, assuming there is _x000D_
an agreement would be reached and sanctions would be lifted?"
2924120,2924119,2924121,19201,3,"    And do we have any idea how many _x000D_
delegations have actually visited Tehran?"
2924121,2924120,2924122,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924122,2924121,2924123,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Flake."
2924123,2924122,2924124,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the _x000D_
witnesses._x000D_
    Like many in this room, I have been supportive of these _x000D_
negotiations. I applaud the administration for undertaking _x000D_
them. I think it is incumbent on us to look for every avenue._x000D_
    We often say that the purpose of sanctions is to get _x000D_
parties to the table. They are at the table, and so I am _x000D_
confused by the notion that some would want to impose _x000D_
additional sanctions while negotiations are going on, _x000D_
recognizing and stating that the purpose of sanctions is to _x000D_
bring people to the negotiating table._x000D_
    Having said that, I am as skeptical as anyone that Iran _x000D_
will actually come through and follow through on their _x000D_
agreements for the long term, and I certainly hope they do._x000D_
    I am as concerned as you are about breaking up this _x000D_
coalition that we have, the P5+1. These sanctions have been _x000D_
effective because they are multilateral, and I am very _x000D_
concerned that that will break up._x000D_
    They are at the table because this has been Iran versus the _x000D_
West rather than Iran versus the United States, and I think _x000D_
that is what we need to make sure continues. And so, I am _x000D_
sensitive to the administration's concern that Congress move _x000D_
ahead now with additional sanctions even triggered that might _x000D_
upset the negotiations and fracture the coalition, the _x000D_
effective coalition that we have._x000D_
    I do believe that if the administration thinks that they _x000D_
can conclude an agreement and move on without Congress weighing _x000D_
in, however, at some point on that agreement, that is a bridge _x000D_
too far. It is our right and our responsibility to weigh in on _x000D_
an ultimate agreement, and so I will be anxious to see the _x000D_
administration's formal response to the chairman's proposal and _x000D_
look forward to those discussions as well._x000D_
    But I also, just as a side agreement, I am glad to see that _x000D_
Treasury, and particularly OFAC, has lessened its load a bit by _x000D_
changing our policy toward Cuba and that we are not spending so _x000D_
much time and resources licensing Americans to travel to Cuba _x000D_
and can free up resources and time and effort to make sure that _x000D_
these agreements and the sanctions that we currently have and _x000D_
future sanctions, if they should be ramped up, that we have the _x000D_
resources to actually do that._x000D_
    But a lot of the questions I had that I was going to ask _x000D_
have been answered already. So I would just say that I applaud _x000D_
the chairman for putting forward the proposal he has in terms _x000D_
of Congress weighing in on an ultimate agreement._x000D_
    But I hope that we are sensitive to these negotiations. I _x000D_
do believe that as many of us have discussed here, that if this _x000D_
JPOA were to continue in perpetuity, it would not be such a bad _x000D_
thing. As long as that breakout time is significant enough and _x000D_
that Iran is not progressing toward a nuclear weapon, that is _x000D_
what our goal should be._x000D_
    And so, I hope that we can stick with these negotiations. I _x000D_
hope that they are fruitful in the end. But I am certainly _x000D_
willing to play as constructive a role as I can as a member of _x000D_
this committee to make sure that that happens._x000D_
    So thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924124,2924123,2924125,19201,3,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Coons."
2924125,2924124,2924126,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for _x000D_
holding this hearing and for the constructive relationship that _x000D_
you and our ranking member have had on this important issue._x000D_
    And I, too, support the administration's strong and _x000D_
persistent and determined efforts to bring Iran to the table, _x000D_
and congressionally enacted and administratively implemented _x000D_
sanctions have made a critical difference in changing the _x000D_
trajectory of Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program. Like many _x000D_
of my colleagues, I have deep suspicion of Iran's intentions _x000D_
and actions, rooted in their human rights violations, their _x000D_
support for terrorism regionally and around the world._x000D_
    Developments even today in Yemen that suggest they continue _x000D_
to engage in activities not just their illicit nuclear weapons _x000D_
program, but in many other ranges that should give us deep _x000D_
pause about any agreement with them. Nonetheless, I think you _x000D_
have made significant progress in getting them to the table and _x000D_
in continuing negotiations._x000D_
    But I will just reassert that no deal is better than a bad _x000D_
deal and that a deal that we cannot ultimately enforce and that _x000D_
we cannot ultimately live with in terms of where it leaves us _x000D_
in the long term or the short term is worse than no deal at _x000D_
all. And one of my core concerns is whether or not we really _x000D_
will have the time to react, we will be really able to detect _x000D_
cheating and leakage, and whether we will be able to sustain _x000D_
the sanctions coalition that you have so successfully convened _x000D_
and put into place around the world._x000D_
    First, just to comment, if I might, to the nominee to be _x000D_
the Deputy Director of the CIA, my congratulations on your _x000D_
great leadership and work in sanctions enforcement. One _x000D_
positive of the omnibus that I think was not widely remarked on _x000D_
was an increase in the resources for sanctions enforcement. And _x000D_
whether it is the lightening of the load that Senator Flake _x000D_
referenced, or an increase in appropriated resources, it is my _x000D_
hope and my confidence that your successor will continue this _x000D_
same determined and vigorous enforcement of sanctions that has _x000D_
been the hallmark of your time there._x000D_
    Let us get into, if we might, both where this deal as _x000D_
imagined and described would leave us and then where we are _x000D_
today._x000D_
    First, where it would leave us. One of my core concerns, _x000D_
expressed eloquently earlier by Senator Kaine, is that we are _x000D_
no longer negotiating the dismantling of Iran's nuclear _x000D_
infrastructure. We are negotiating for them to retain enough _x000D_
enrichment capacity and enough facilities that we have _x000D_
confidence that their breakout time is no less than a year._x000D_
    What does that leave us in 2021 or shortly thereafter? I _x000D_
know the exact length of the agreement is not yet finalized, _x000D_
but how do we avoid the regional proliferation that would come _x000D_
from an agreement that essentially locks in Iran as a threshold _x000D_
nuclear power? And how do we ensure that the message that the _x000D_
region and the world takes from this agreement is not that we _x000D_
have assented to there being a threshold nuclear-weapons-_x000D_
capable power?"
2924126,2924125,2924127,19201,3,"    And I am concerned that centrifuge R&D also _x000D_
be a central part of the negotiations, because perhaps in the _x000D_
first phase of the JPOA, it was not as fully embraced as it _x000D_
should have been. My sense is that, moving forward, it now is._x000D_
    There are two different ways that they could expand their _x000D_
breakout time. One would be the accumulation of potentially _x000D_
fissile material. I think the JPOA has dealt with that _x000D_
effectively, and my understanding is the negotiations have that _x000D_
clearly in its sights._x000D_
    A core concern going forward is that they not be allowed in _x000D_
any way to engage in the sort of R&D that would change their _x000D_
breakout time on the backside, whether it is in 2021 or through _x000D_
illicit means. We do need to shut down any potential centrifuge _x000D_
R&D."
2924127,2924126,2924128,19201,3,    Thank you.
2924128,2924127,2924129,19201,3,    Sure.
2924129,2924128,2924130,19201,3,"    Thank you. You have done a great job with _x000D_
limited resources. I am glad you will have even more resources, _x000D_
and I wish you the best of luck in your new opportunity._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924130,2924129,2924131,19201,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Paul."
2924131,2924130,2924132,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    When our Founders brought together our Government, they _x000D_
brought together coequal branches. And the hope was that they _x000D_
would pit ambition versus ambition, and the ambitions of _x000D_
Congress to maintain its power would be pitted against an _x000D_
Executive who wanted more power, and that this back and forth _x000D_
would check and balance power. I am glad to see today that _x000D_
there is some exhibition that on both sides of the aisle _x000D_
Congress is trying to pit their ambition against the Executive _x000D_
and check the power of the Executive._x000D_
    In saying this, though, I believe that we have all _x000D_
concluded, both Congress and the Executive, that the final _x000D_
passage has to be done by Congress. We are arguing over _x000D_
waivers, suspension of waivers, and how long these waivers will _x000D_
be. If we could get to the crux of the argument, maybe there _x000D_
could be an agreement that could be found._x000D_
    The lesson to us, though, is when we rewrite this _x000D_
legislation, any legislation moving forward, we need to be a _x000D_
little more careful with waivers we give, because they will not _x000D_
want to give them up very easily._x000D_
    As we move forward, I have been one who says new sanctions _x000D_
in the middle of negotiations is a huge mistake and may well _x000D_
break up the sanctions coalition, may well drive Iran away from _x000D_
the table. I have been one who wants sanctions because I do not _x000D_
want war, frankly._x000D_
    There are many on our side who often say, well, we do not _x000D_
need 535 generals. The President should just do what he needs _x000D_
to do in times of war. I think there is a certain analogy to _x000D_
diplomacy, that we do not need 535 negotiators. But I also do _x000D_
not want to give up my right to approve of the negotiation._x000D_
    At the end of this, you want this suspension to go on, I do _x000D_
not know, maybe to the end of the President's term. If I am the _x000D_
Iranians, why would I care to go through all of this to have _x000D_
sanctions relief for a year, a year and a half?_x000D_
    You have greater ability to negotiate once you affirm, _x000D_
which is the law, that we will have to pass the final _x000D_
negotiation._x000D_
    Just admit to it. Come to an agreement with Senator Corker, _x000D_
admit to it, what is the law, and then we can have permanent _x000D_
sanctions relief, trade with Iran again, if they will submit. _x000D_
They will be more assured of what we are doing and of the _x000D_
agreement if they know it has to pass us._x000D_
    I have heard whispered when I talk to people on your side, _x000D_
``Oh, those Republicans will never approve anything.'' But as _x000D_
you listen to us, all the way around, I think there is a nuance _x000D_
of opinion. I think there are several of us on this side who do _x000D_
not blanket say no, we will not vote to approve an agreement. _x000D_
But we want you to know that we have the right to vote, so you _x000D_
come and talk to us, so you talk to the chairman._x000D_
    I have been working with Senator Boxer on an agreement that _x000D_
would not be new sanctions. It would basically be, if they do _x000D_
not comply with the current agreement, sanctions would renew. _x000D_
But I also would like to marry that with what Senator Corker is _x000D_
talking about, the admission, and this would be admission and a _x000D_
signal, but it is the law that you will have to get our _x000D_
agreement in the and._x000D_
    Is there any kind of compromise in there? Maybe. I think _x000D_
you need to talk to Senator Corker. There could be something on _x000D_
the suspension that is a period of time. But I do not know what _x000D_
90 days really gives you, or 120 days. We could do years of _x000D_
negotiation to get 120 days of sanction relief. They want _x000D_
permanent relief._x000D_
    That is the carrot we are dangling, and we want something _x000D_
from them. We want them to live in a safe, nonnuclear world. _x000D_
That is what we want._x000D_
    So I agree. We keep asking for more and more. Centrifuges _x000D_
have to be part of this. All of it has to be part of this._x000D_
    But I do not know that you gain a lot in the administration _x000D_
by saying that we are not going to agree to what Senator Corker _x000D_
is saying, we are not going to agree that the final agreement _x000D_
has to be done by Congress. In doing so, you bring us to an _x000D_
impasse. There is a chance of an override of a veto, frankly._x000D_
    I am somebody who wants to work to find a middle ground, _x000D_
but I also want you to include some of the language that _x000D_
Senator Corker is talking about, admitting that not only--we do _x000D_
not want to be consulted. I do not want you to come pat me on _x000D_
the back and say, hey, this is what we just did. I want you to _x000D_
ask me for permission, and I want you to present the agreement _x000D_
to us, and I want you to present an agreement we all like._x000D_
    You are not going to get everybody, but I think the vast _x000D_
majority will vote for a reasonable thing. My argument is let _x000D_
us see if we can actually read proposals, talk to individuals, _x000D_
and see if there is some kind of common ground we can find._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924132,2924131,2924133,19201,3,"    And actually, I agree with that point. So the _x000D_
idea of suspension is not a bad idea. However, then you need to _x000D_
work with us. I like the idea. We vote on a 1-year suspension. _x000D_
Let us find out if they are complying. If we like the terms of _x000D_
the agreement, let us vote again in another year on another _x000D_
year's suspension._x000D_
    But just do not think that you are going to be able to do _x000D_
it by yourselves. If you will acknowledge you have to bring it _x000D_
to us, come and sell us. Democracy is messy. And that is the _x000D_
thing._x000D_
    You have to come and sell us on something. It is not _x000D_
consultation. You have to sell us because we are your boss. We _x000D_
are your coequal in this. We are not your subject. We are your _x000D_
coequal._x000D_
    I fully believe that you can bring, if you have all P5+1 on _x000D_
board with a negotiated settlement, I think you can sell it to _x000D_
us. I, frankly, think it is not an impossible sell."
2924133,2924132,2924134,19201,3,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    I will say consultations up until this point have been a _x000D_
phone call in the morning that something is happening. And, _x000D_
generally speaking, while we are receiving that phone call, we _x000D_
are reading the New York Times or someone else's report._x000D_
    So I do want to associate myself with his comments, _x000D_
generally speaking, and do hope we will come to some accord._x000D_
    Senator Udall."
2924134,2924133,2924135,19201,3,"    Thank you, Senator Corker. Let me join with _x000D_
others in thanking you and Senator Menendez, in terms of trying _x000D_
to work through things and, you have shown it when your _x000D_
positions were reversed, move us in a bipartisan way and get _x000D_
agreements. I hope we continue that as we move along._x000D_
    I very much appreciate having the witnesses here today._x000D_
    At the last, you repeat many things that have been said, _x000D_
but I also support the negotiations. I think it is very _x000D_
important that Congress does not torpedo them and disrupt them. _x000D_
But I think the message you are getting from us is we want a _x000D_
hardnosed negotiation. We want to be involved in the process. _x000D_
Part of it is going through this hearing._x000D_
    I think one of the things you are saying that is absolutely _x000D_
key is, if we were alone doing sanctions without all these _x000D_
other countries, we would be in a much different situation. It _x000D_
is holding the coalition together that is tremendously _x000D_
important._x000D_
    I think we need to remember that when we move forward with _x000D_
whatever the negotiations produce, that we want to keep all _x000D_
those countries together and keep the pressure on. I would like _x000D_
you to just comment on that, but I have a couple questions _x000D_
here._x000D_
    One is, how quickly could we put additional sanctions in _x000D_
place, if you had a failure? That is one._x000D_
    And another is an observation on the side of, we hear a lot _x000D_
about the Supreme Leader in Iran. We hear a lot about the _x000D_
President. And then we hear a lot about the hard-line. The _x000D_
roles of the various players there, who is going to really _x000D_
determine that Iran signs onto this deal?_x000D_
    As you follow this, you begin to wonder who is in charge _x000D_
there. So then that leads to the question, if you have an _x000D_
agreement, who could undermine it in the future?_x000D_
    I am going to go ahead and let you take a shot at a couple _x000D_
of those, and maybe follow up here in a minute."
2924135,2924134,2924136,19201,3,"    And do you think, Secretary Cohen, other _x000D_
countries, the ones that we are working with, if things _x000D_
developed in a negative way, that they would then be willing to _x000D_
join us on that?"
2924136,2924135,2924137,19201,3,    Thank you.
2924137,2924136,2924138,19201,3,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    And thank you, Chairman Corker."
2924138,2924137,2924139,19201,3,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    Senator Rubio."
2924139,2924138,2924140,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Secretary Blinken, much of this debate here today has been _x000D_
about the role of Congress and our need to trust in the ability _x000D_
of the administration to craft a good deal, and in the fact _x000D_
that we are going to be consulted. That was the question that _x000D_
you asked._x000D_
    So I want to take you back to the last time you were before _x000D_
this committee, and I asked you a question at that time, during _x000D_
your nomination, about whether there would be any unilateral _x000D_
changes or changes in Cuba policy. And your answer, and I want _x000D_
to quote it to you, it said, ``Anything that in the future that _x000D_
might be done on Cuba would be done in full consultation, with _x000D_
the real meaning of the word `consultation' that I just alluded _x000D_
to, with this committee.'' You told me that the last time you _x000D_
were before this committee._x000D_
    Who did you consult with on this committee? Or who did the _x000D_
administration consult with on this committee before it _x000D_
announced the changes on the 17th of December?"
2924140,2924139,2924141,19201,3,"    Did you consult with the chairman of the _x000D_
committee?"
2924141,2924140,2924142,19201,3,    Who were the members who were consulted?
2924142,2924141,2924143,19201,3,"    If I could interject, I assure you that I was _x000D_
not consulted."
2924143,2924142,2924144,19201,3,"    Mr. Chairman, you were the chairman at the _x000D_
time, were you consulted?"
2924144,2924143,2924145,19201,3,"    Well, no. There is a difference between _x000D_
notification and consultation. Being notified when it is going _x000D_
to happen is not consultation."
2924145,2924144,2924146,19201,3,"    And the reason why this is relevant is we _x000D_
are being told that we are going to be in the loop on _x000D_
everything that is happening with Iran. We have an example very _x000D_
recently that we were not in the loop._x000D_
    But you were aware at the time that these conversations _x000D_
were occurring with the Cubans, were you not?"
2924146,2924145,2924147,19201,3,    It was not more delicate than this.
2924147,2924146,2924148,19201,3,"    But I am not quarreling with the Alan Gross _x000D_
release. I am quarreling with the policy changes that were _x000D_
made._x000D_
    Why it is relevant to Iran is that we are being asked to _x000D_
trust that we are going to be fully consulted. The use of the _x000D_
word ``consultation'' as it has been defined by the _x000D_
administration in the last instance that I just cited is _x000D_
problematic._x000D_
    I do not want to make this all about Cuba, not to belabor _x000D_
the point, but I also asked whether there would be any changes _x000D_
in policy absent democratic order. I asked you whether the _x000D_
changes, when you say move forward, move forward on democratic _x000D_
reforms, not simply economic reforms, and you said not simply _x000D_
economic reforms._x000D_
    And clearly, we do not see any democratic reforms. There _x000D_
was release of 53 political prisoners. Fourteen had already _x000D_
been released on December 17. One of them had been released _x000D_
almost a full year before December 17. Four had fully completed _x000D_
their sentences. Five have been rearrested. And since the deal _x000D_
was done on the 17th, 200 new political arrests have occurred _x000D_
in Cuba._x000D_
    But here is why that is relevant to this, because we are _x000D_
being asked as a Congress to sit tight, because we are going to _x000D_
be fully consulted. And it sounds like the only people who are _x000D_
going to be fully consulted are the people who agree with the _x000D_
administration. And if you do not agree with the _x000D_
administration, then you will just be notified._x000D_
    My second point goes to the question that both Senator _x000D_
Udall asked about who is in charge, but also what Senator _x000D_
Johnson asked about why the Iranians would undergo so much pain _x000D_
in pursuit of this._x000D_
    The answer to who is in charge, unless you dispute it, is, _x000D_
ultimately, who is in charge is who they call the supreme _x000D_
leader, the ayatollah. Is that accurate?"
2924148,2924147,2924149,19201,3,"    All right. Can they possibly agree to a _x000D_
change of the kind we are contemplating without his approval, _x000D_
given the support he has in their legislative branch?"
2924149,2924148,2924150,19201,3,"    Highly unlikely. So who is this ayatollah? _x000D_
Well, the ayatollah is not simply a head of state as we _x000D_
normally see it, the head of a nation-state. He is a radical _x000D_
cleric who, first of all, he does not just view Iran as a _x000D_
nation-state. He views Iran as a cause, as Henry Kissinger has _x000D_
described it. The cause is to eventually have the entire world _x000D_
living under the flag of Islam. That is actually stated in _x000D_
their constitution._x000D_
    It goes further and states that the ayatollah is not just _x000D_
the leader of Iran. He is the leader of all Muslims in the _x000D_
world._x000D_
    Is that not accurate? That is his position and title._x000D_
    So Iran is where he lives, but he views his mandate as _x000D_
extending to the whole world. But it goes beyond this. These _x000D_
are unambiguous statements on their part. He does not just view _x000D_
himself as a cleric. He views himself as the temporary fill-in _x000D_
for the 13th imam, the Mahdi, who under Shia, his _x000D_
interpretation of Shia, and I think the mainstream _x000D_
interpretation of Shia, is an imam that is currently in _x000D_
occultation who will emerge one day in the world and govern the _x000D_
entire world under the flag of Islam. Their stated purpose for _x000D_
the state of Iran is to serve as a base for that effort _x000D_
throughout the world._x000D_
    That is what motivates him. We are ascribing to his regime _x000D_
nation-state characteristics of a normal country that has a _x000D_
cost-benefit analysis about what is in the national interest of _x000D_
Iran. I do not dispute that there might be some political _x000D_
leaders in Iran who hold those views, but the ayatollah, the _x000D_
supreme leader, he does not view it that way. He views it as _x000D_
not just his calling, but his obligation to bring about the _x000D_
arrival of the 13th imam and to unify the world under the flag _x000D_
of radical Islam as he defines it._x000D_
    Here is why that is important. Under his clerical _x000D_
interpretation, and that of many in Shia, the 13th imam cannot _x000D_
emerge until there is a cataclysmic showdown between the Muslim _x000D_
and non-Muslim world. And when a country led by a person who _x000D_
wants there to be a cataclysmic showdown between the Muslim and _x000D_
non-Muslim world has designs on a nuclear weapon, now we have _x000D_
cause for great concern._x000D_
    And that is why they expand their military capability, and _x000D_
that is why they want a nuclear weapon._x000D_
    Now what they have shown is some crafty ability. They _x000D_
reject everything that is not Islamic in the world. They reject _x000D_
the legitimacy of the U.N. They reject the legitimacy of the _x000D_
United States. But they are very crafty. They accept the _x000D_
benefits of the international order--for example, their seat at _x000D_
the U.N.--but while still being able to reject their _x000D_
obligations under that international order._x000D_
    So what have they done with all that? Well, let us go _x000D_
through the timeline. In 2003, the position of the world was no _x000D_
enrichment. Then it became, you can enrich up to 20 percent. _x000D_
Then it became, you can enrich over 20 percent, as long as you _x000D_
send it overseas. Now it is, you can enrich up to 20 percent in _x000D_
Iran, as long as it is for a research facility._x000D_
    So if you go by the timeline of what they have been able to _x000D_
achieve over the last 10 years, it is pretty impressive how _x000D_
they have been able to use this process. In another 5 years, _x000D_
maybe we will build the bomb for them, at the rate this is _x000D_
going._x000D_
    In the meantime, the other two components of a nuclear _x000D_
program move forward unabated. A weapon design, you can buy _x000D_
that. You can buy that. You can buy a weapons design right now. _x000D_
Heck, you can download it online, potentially, if it is a crude _x000D_
weapon._x000D_
    And the missile program continues unabated. They continue _x000D_
to test long-range missile capabilities, not to mention adding _x000D_
to their already considerable conventional weapons capability._x000D_
    So this is why we are very concerned and have a right to be _x000D_
concerned. This is not a traditional nation-state undergoing a _x000D_
cost-benefit analysis. This is a cleric-led regime, a clerical _x000D_
government, with a clear intent of ultimately one day unifying _x000D_
the entire world under the flag of their radical version of _x000D_
Islam, led by someone who believes that will only happen after _x000D_
a cataclysmic showdown with the West._x000D_
    So we have real reasons to be deeply concerned and _x000D_
skeptical about the ability to reach any arrangement, and real _x000D_
reasons to believe that they are willing to accept short-term _x000D_
suspensions because their long-term view is that at the end of _x000D_
the day they are going to be at that showdown point. And if _x000D_
they have nuclear weapons, they are even better off than they _x000D_
would normally be._x000D_
    And that is why we are so skeptical about this deal. We are _x000D_
not dealing with Belgium here. We are not deal dealing with _x000D_
Luxembourg. We are dealing with a radical cleric with a radical _x000D_
view of his obligation and role in the world. And he wants _x000D_
nuclear weapons to be able to do it._x000D_
    And I believe that ultimately, I think no one here could _x000D_
dispute that, ultimately, even if they agree to a short _x000D_
suspension, that is their goal in the long term._x000D_
    And as the North Koreans have shown, you can agree to all _x000D_
sorts of short-term suspensions, and you can always invent a _x000D_
pretext for why now I need the weapon, because of hostilities _x000D_
of the West, because it is time for the hidden imam to emerge, _x000D_
whatever._x000D_
    And that is what we are concerned about. They will retain _x000D_
all the infrastructure that it takes to enrich. They will have _x000D_
a weapons design. They will have a delivery system in the _x000D_
missiles. And at some point, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, they _x000D_
build a weapon and now the world is at their mercy. That is why _x000D_
we are so skeptical."
2924150,2924149,2924151,19201,3,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    If I could say, again, this committee is not proposing _x000D_
anything that breaks us apart from the international partners _x000D_
that we have. I know you keep referring to that. I know that is _x000D_
a red herring that keeps being thrown out. But we are asking, _x000D_
many of us, for consultation and a vote on the deal that we _x000D_
have been so involved in making happen._x000D_
    Senator Risch."
2924151,2924150,2924152,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief._x000D_
    First of all, put me in the column with the skeptics on _x000D_
this committee, such as the chairman and the ranking member _x000D_
and, likewise, Senator Kaine._x000D_
    I have been sitting through this from the beginning. I _x000D_
thought these guys were going to scam you from the beginning. I _x000D_
am convinced today that they have done that. I think they have _x000D_
us set up for what could be a real disaster._x000D_
    I mean, just think about how they went about this. First of _x000D_
all, what you have to do is look at the background, as _x000D_
articulated by Senator Rubio. But in addition to that, look at _x000D_
the efforts we have had in the past. Go back and read the _x000D_
chapter in Rouhani's book about what he did to the American _x000D_
negotiators, how he kept them at the table, and how he dragged _x000D_
his feet, and how he was using the peace process to actually _x000D_
continue their ambitions to get a nuclear weapon._x000D_
    All right, use that as your background. Then think about _x000D_
the U.N. resolution that said, ``Look, Iran, you cannot do this _x000D_
anymore.'' And Iran said, ``Nope, we are going to do it no _x000D_
matter what. We are not even going to negotiate, unless you _x000D_
guys agree that we can have some kind of a program.'' So now _x000D_
they have crossed that bridge._x000D_
    If you are going to do this and you are going to continue _x000D_
with your nuclear ambitions, going in the direction that _x000D_
Senator Rubio has suggested, why would you not sit down with _x000D_
your enemy, negotiate this kind of deal, and now you know _x000D_
exactly what the enemy is going to know. You are going to know _x000D_
what the inspection regime is. You are going to know how they _x000D_
are going to go about this. And you are going to be able to put _x000D_
together a system where you can continue your ambitions while _x000D_
the people who are supposed to be curtailing you are going _x000D_
about what they are going about and you knowing all the ways _x000D_
they are going to do it._x000D_
    I mean, I think you guys are being bamboozled. I really do. _x000D_
And I hope you can come in here someday and say, ``Ha, you _x000D_
doofus, you had no idea what you were talking about.'' I do not _x000D_
think that is going to happen._x000D_
    These people are bad people. I am on the Intelligence _x000D_
Committee. I sit here and every time we have a problem in that _x000D_
area of the world, whether it is Syria, whether it is Iraq, _x000D_
whether it is Yemen, or whether it is Hezbollah, wherever it _x000D_
pops up, whose fingerprints are on this? It is the Iranians._x000D_
    So look, it is getting late. I appreciate what you guys are _x000D_
doing. Bless you. I hope you can pull it off. But I have to _x000D_
tell you, I thought from the beginning you were going to get _x000D_
scammed, and every day that goes by here, and as I listen to _x000D_
how these negotiations are going, I think you are getting _x000D_
scammed. And I hope I am dead wrong."
2924152,2924151,2924153,19201,3,"    Mr. Blinken, you have said all of that _x000D_
before. And I appreciate that. Like I said, I hope it works._x000D_
    My problem is this. Any inspection regime, any regime that _x000D_
you put together for doing this, they are going to know all _x000D_
about it. They are going to know all the details of it._x000D_
    And just remember that their objective is not your _x000D_
objective. Your objective, our objective, is to stop them._x000D_
    Their objective is to get to that point and doing it such _x000D_
that they are not going to get attacked in the meantime. They _x000D_
are going to know all the details of how to do it. In any _x000D_
regime you put together, there is technology that can get _x000D_
around that. So I hope you are right._x000D_
    Let me just close with this, on a very parochial matter. As _x000D_
we are speaking here right now, the President is on his way to _x000D_
Idaho. And while he is there, pursuant to a request from us, _x000D_
and we are happy he did so, he is going to meet with a woman by _x000D_
the name of Mrs. Abedini. Her husband is in prison in Iran. He _x000D_
should not be. There are three Americans who are there._x000D_
    For the life of me, and Wendy Sherman has had to sit there _x000D_
and listen to me say this month after month after month, why _x000D_
you guys cut loose of all that money, when they are so cash _x000D_
hungry, without putting your hand on it and saying we are going _x000D_
to take it off when those three guys are free, I cannot believe _x000D_
that they would not have cut those guys loose._x000D_
    I want to urge you again. The administration says it is the _x000D_
compassionate arm of the government. So be it. But use some _x000D_
compassion. Help Mrs. Abedini and those two little kids. Let us _x000D_
get this guy home. He has no business being in jail in Iran _x000D_
simply because he is a Christian and was over there doing _x000D_
Christian kinds of things._x000D_
    So with that, my time is up. And thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924153,2924152,2924154,19201,3,    Get it done.
2924154,2924153,2924155,19201,3,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Menendez."
2924155,2924154,2924156,19201,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for your _x000D_
courtesy. I just have a couple quick questions and a couple _x000D_
observations._x000D_
    Secretary Blinken, let us be honest, as it relates to _x000D_
consultation, there was consultation, long consultations with _x000D_
members who were in agreement with the President's proposed _x000D_
policy changes, but none who might be in disagreement. That is _x000D_
on Cuba._x000D_
    And that gives rise to the concern that there will be no _x000D_
consultation, but notification only, to those of us who may be _x000D_
concerned about the nature of any agreement or continuous _x000D_
rolling extensions. So I hope you understand that, as it _x000D_
relates to moving forward._x000D_
    It was the subject of your conversation with me when you _x000D_
were a nominee, of questions I asked you here before the _x000D_
committee in your nomination. And I am disappointed._x000D_
    With reference to March 24, if there is a ``deal,'' will _x000D_
that deal be written?"
2924156,2924155,2924157,19201,3,"    Well, would not the outlines of a deal be _x000D_
something that the Iranians and the P5+1 should be able to sign _x000D_
to at least, so that there is no changing or, ``That is not _x000D_
what we understood,'' or, ``That is not what we agreed to''?"
2924157,2924156,2924158,19201,3,"    It concerns me that we may not have a _x000D_
written agreement._x000D_
    Let me ask you this: there is no deal on March 24. You _x000D_
cannot come to even the outlines of an agreement. What then?"
2924158,2924157,2924159,19201,3,"    You may very well say, well, let us keep _x000D_
it going."
2924159,2924158,2924160,19201,3,"    Secretary Cohen, any of those hundred _x000D_
sanctions that you talked about that you levied, was Iran _x000D_
complicit in any of them, in terms of trying to evade _x000D_
sanctions? Or were the individuals just working on their own?"
2924160,2924159,2924161,19201,3,"    So during this period of time of the _x000D_
Joint Plan of Action, there actually were efforts by Iran to _x000D_
evade sanctions. Fortunately, at least in those instances, you _x000D_
caught them. So it gives me another concern about their intent._x000D_
    Let me just say a couple of observations. Number one, with _x000D_
reference to Senator Paul and Senator Boxer, I am not sure that _x000D_
legislation that says that this is what will happen if there is _x000D_
no deal or a violation of a deal, which you say you think, _x000D_
Secretary Blinken, is acceptable, is any different, really, _x000D_
than what we are saying, which is we impose nothing until after _x000D_
the fact if there is no deal. I think that is nuanced, at best._x000D_
    It is interesting to note that sanctions on Russia vis-a-_x000D_
vis Ukraine has not caused them to walk away from what they _x000D_
think is an important deal to be achieved. So the suggestion _x000D_
that sanctions alone that will never happen until after a _x000D_
certain point in time, in which you have either concluded a _x000D_
deal or not, and that will not happen if there is a deal, if _x000D_
the Russians would not walk away with sanctions on Ukraine _x000D_
saying if you are hurting us on this, we are going to hurt you _x000D_
on that is, I think, pretty telling._x000D_
    And to be very honest with you, Secretary Cohen, the _x000D_
overwhelming number of sanctions that this committee has levied _x000D_
through the Congress have overwhelmingly had a much more _x000D_
significant lead period of time than immediate imposition. _x000D_
Obviously, the time frame necessary for it to have an effect on _x000D_
Iran has been even greater._x000D_
    So there is no such thing as an immediate sanction that _x000D_
ultimately has an immediate effect. There are very few of _x000D_
those. It takes time for there to be consequences._x000D_
    I do not know, but it seemed to me it took us a fair amount _x000D_
of time to know about Parchin, which was a covert operation. So _x000D_
I would hate to see that even with what we envision as _x000D_
verification and inspection, that an attempt to do something _x000D_
covert would take us as much time as it took us in Parchin to _x000D_
uncover, and that would be consequential._x000D_
    Finally, Mr. Secretary, you stated that we will have the _x000D_
same ability to respond in the future, should Iran breach or _x000D_
break out, and we will have all options on the table. I think _x000D_
that ignores the reality that Iran will be in a different _x000D_
position._x000D_
    Iran will be able to sell more than 2 million barrels of _x000D_
oil. It will have access to $100 billion in reserves currently _x000D_
being held overseas. And it will have the ability to procure _x000D_
critical items for its program._x000D_
    It gets a lot from an agreement that will apparently _x000D_
require note dismantling of its program. We get a 1-year alarm _x000D_
bell, which just may not be enough time to react in a _x000D_
nonmilitary fashion._x000D_
    So the very essence of the President's concern and is _x000D_
telling people that, well, sanctions, if it breaks the _x000D_
coalition, then we may be left with only a military option. I _x000D_
will tell you something, if you have nothing in place after a _x000D_
no-deal situation, then the President may very well be of his _x000D_
own design in a position in which his only option is a military _x000D_
option or accepting Iran as a nuclear state. And that is a _x000D_
pretty terrible set of circumstances._x000D_
    Now maybe you do not fear that because maybe there is _x000D_
another set of secret letters or deals on the side that we do _x000D_
not know about. There have been a lot of those in these _x000D_
different transactions. So I do not know if there are. Maybe _x000D_
you can tell us whether there are any that we should be waiting _x000D_
upon."
2924161,2924160,2924162,19201,3,"    Well, that is good to know. Hopefully, _x000D_
none will surface afterward, because then we will have to have _x000D_
a real conversation._x000D_
    So I will just say, look, I think that to some degree, no _x000D_
one has worked harder to try to get you to the point to _x000D_
succeed. I want you to succeed. But by the same token, I have _x000D_
to be honest with you, you need to succeed in a way that is _x000D_
meaningful, at the end of the day._x000D_
    And there is a bit of a trust problem here, because when _x000D_
you have secret deals, when you do not consult, which is to _x000D_
ask, ``We are thinking about proceeding on this course. What do _x000D_
you think about that?'' versus just telling us, ``This is what _x000D_
we have done.'' That is notification, not consultation._x000D_
    And when Secretary Cohen and Wendy Sherman were here in the _x000D_
past, when I was pursuing sanctions, and I heard all the alarm _x000D_
bells as well--even after I was asked to work with Senator Kirk _x000D_
to come up with a more reasonable sanctions regime--and then _x000D_
have them oppose it before this committee, it creates a real _x000D_
concern about when you raise alarm bells--and that passed 99-0. _x000D_
And now you herald it as part of your ability to get Iran to _x000D_
negotiate. So that is a real concern, as well._x000D_
    So there is a difference between our aspirations and _x000D_
realism. Aspirations had us strike a deal with North Korea, _x000D_
including with one of your present negotiators. Realism is that _x000D_
they ended up being a nuclear arms state. That is what we are _x000D_
trying to avoid here._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924162,2924161,2924163,19201,3,"    Thank you, sir. Again, thanks for all your _x000D_
efforts to bring us to this point. I look forward, over the _x000D_
next few days, to see if there is some common ground to address _x000D_
the consultation and Congress' role, ultimately, in this._x000D_
    I do want to say one thing. I know there have been a lot of _x000D_
discussions about Bibi Netanyahu's whatever you might have _x000D_
called his prop at the U.N. I think it is fair to note that _x000D_
with the additional research and development that Iran has _x000D_
done, and they are moving way up the food chain from the _x000D_
standpoint of the centrifuge development, they can move so much _x000D_
more quickly from 0 to 90 percent now that that is almost an _x000D_
old adage. I think you all are very aware of that._x000D_
    And I think that is the concern that we have. It is on the _x000D_
research and development component, and the things they are _x000D_
doing to move rapidly--rapidly--toward being able to get to 90 _x000D_
percent very, very quickly._x000D_
    But let me just give a few closing comments. I, too, want _x000D_
you to be successful. I wake up every day wanting our Nation to _x000D_
be successful in every endeavor. And I think I have shown to _x000D_
this administration my desire to work toward common ground and _x000D_
to try to solve problems. So I want these negotiations to be _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    And I had one of the most impactful meetings, along with a _x000D_
number of people here on the committee, in Israel just in the _x000D_
last couple days._x000D_
    But I think the concerns are, as you look back over the _x000D_
history over the last 10 years that some people have alluded _x000D_
to, Iran has stayed here and the P5 began here, and as the _x000D_
negotiations have progressed, what has happened is the P5 and _x000D_
us, being the major driving force, have continued to move _x000D_
toward their position._x000D_
    And I would just argue that, again, having Congress as a _x000D_
backstop as you enter these final steps, having Congress as a _x000D_
backstop, someone that you do, in fact, not only have to _x000D_
consult with but you have to seek their approval, would be _x000D_
somewhat of an anchor to keep us from continuing to move toward _x000D_
their position._x000D_
    I think it would be very difficult for you to say that _x000D_
there has not been a continual movement toward their position. _x000D_
I mean, you look at where we began with the U.N. security _x000D_
resolutions, you look at where we began with us potentially _x000D_
agreeing to them having enough centrifuges to serve their, _x000D_
quote, ``practical needs,'' which, as I understand it, every _x000D_
scientist has said was about 500 centrifuges, and I think you _x000D_
would tell me today we have moved way beyond that._x000D_
    So I would just say to you, Congress can be an excellent _x000D_
backstop to you as you are moving down the road._x000D_
    I thought Senator Kaine probably expressed it better than _x000D_
any of us here. When we entered into these agreements that _x000D_
Senator Menendez was so much a part of, meaning the sanctions, _x000D_
I do not think anyone in giving you the national security _x000D_
waivers ever thought the President was going to suspend them, _x000D_
in all likelihood, until the end of his term. I do not think _x000D_
anybody ever thought that._x000D_
    So the fact that we know that if you do that, the entire _x000D_
sanctions regime falls apart. I have tremendous respect for _x000D_
Secretary Cohen. But the fact is, these take a long time to put _x000D_
together. And so, again, to have to come to us on the front end _x000D_
of a deal, before you dismantle the entire regime, to me, is an _x000D_
incredibly important step that I hope you with will consult _x000D_
with us on._x000D_
    We laid out a proposal. We hope you will consult. And we _x000D_
hope you will come to an agreement that takes into account some _x000D_
of the nuance that you pointed out earlier, that you would like _x000D_
us to discuss._x000D_
    But just stiff-arming, and saying after the role that we _x000D_
have played, to basically put the international community at _x000D_
the table just to stiff-arm, say, ``No, we really do not want _x000D_
you to play a role. You want you just to trust us,'' is totally _x000D_
unacceptable, from my standpoint._x000D_
    So look, the Supreme Leader, we keep referring to him._x000D_
    And apparently as we negotiate, we seem to be more _x000D_
concerned about the Supreme lLader's position than anyone _x000D_
else's. I just want to lay out one thing. The Supreme Leader _x000D_
has said publicly that one of his major concerns is that Iran _x000D_
enters into an agreement and somehow, over time, Congress _x000D_
changes its mind._x000D_
    We have a presidential race that is coming up. I assure you _x000D_
that the Iran component will be a major part of the next _x000D_
Presidential race. I believe that to be the case. And so, since _x000D_
there is so much concern about the supreme leader and him _x000D_
walking away or doing whatever, I would just say that Congress' _x000D_
approval of a deal to me would be reassuring that whatever deal _x000D_
that you have done will stand the test of time._x000D_
    So I would encourage you to sit down, to walk through with _x000D_
us some of the concerns you have about timing. But I would say _x000D_
that general movement today is toward Congress playing a role. _x000D_
I think, again, just stiff-arming does not take us to a place _x000D_
that probably meets the test that both of us need to meet. And _x000D_
I would encourage you again to sit down and talk with us._x000D_
    We thank you for being here today. We thank you both, in _x000D_
spite of our concerns, for your service to our country._x000D_
    Let me just give some formalities._x000D_
    For the information of the members, the record will remain _x000D_
open until the close of business Friday, including for members _x000D_
to submit questions for the record._x000D_
    We ask the witnesses to respond as promptly as possible. _x000D_
Your responses will also be made a part of the record."
2924163,2924162,2924164,19201,3,"    With the thanks of the committee, this _x000D_
hearing is now adjourned. Thank you."
2924164,2924163,2924165,19202,1,"    This hearing is called to order. I want to _x000D_
start off by thanking all the witnesses for taking the time, _x000D_
traveling here, and preparing some thoughtful testimony. I also _x000D_
want to offer my condolences to all of those who knew Boris _x000D_
Nemtsov, who considered him a friend and comrade. A real _x000D_
tragedy happened a day, I think, after we noticed this hearing. _x000D_
It certainly was not one of the things I wanted to talk about, _x000D_
certainly nothing we contemplated._x000D_
    The purpose of this hearing is really to lay out a reality. _x000D_
It is to tell a story, and the story that needs to be told is _x000D_
what has become of Russia since Vladimir Putin has come to _x000D_
power. I am not going to tell the story. These gentlemen are _x000D_
going to be telling the story. Unless we understand the _x000D_
reality, unless we are willing to face the reality, unless we _x000D_
are willing to grapple with the reality, Vladimir Putin will _x000D_
continue his aggression, and it will not only destabilize _x000D_
Eastern Europe, it will destabilize the entire efforts of all _x000D_
those who want to seek peace and prosperity in the world._x000D_
    We have a couple of photographs that I want to highlight. _x000D_
Starting to my right is a picture of Boris Nemtsov, a very _x000D_
courageous man that I had the privilege of meeting in my _x000D_
office, a man who brought to my office a longer list of people _x000D_
who needed to be added to the Magnitsky list. Unfortunately in _x000D_
the next picture right behind Senator Gardner is a picture of _x000D_
Boris Nemtsov having been assassinated with the Kremlin in the _x000D_
background. Now, that would be somewhat similar to an _x000D_
assassination carried out on Constitution Avenue with the _x000D_
Capitol in the background._x000D_
    In my written opening statement, which I would ask to be _x000D_
entered into the record, we have laid out a timeline that _x000D_
starts with the fall of the Berlin Wall and then traces through _x000D_
the history. But in particular, I want people to pay attention _x000D_
to the history following the ascension of Mr. Putin to power in _x000D_
Russia. And I think probably the most powerful part of that _x000D_
timeline are the 29 assassinations of political figures, 29 _x000D_
assassinations and murders that have never been adequately _x000D_
solved. I think people need to really contemplate that._x000D_
    Next picture, and we do not have the quote on there. This _x000D_
picture is actually a Ukrainian rebel talking about the number _x000D_
of Russian troops that he was thankful for that had entered _x000D_
Eastern Ukraine._x000D_
    The next picture is one of tragedy, as Malaysian Flight _x000D_
Number MH17 was shot down out of the sky on July 17 of 2014. _x000D_
Two hundred and ninety-eight innocent civilians were murdered. _x000D_
This shows a picture of that. And then we have scenes of the _x000D_
devastation in Eastern Ukraine._x000D_
    So that is a little pictorial history of the results of _x000D_
Vladimir Putin's aggression, and that is the story that needs _x000D_
to be told. That is the reality that needs to be faced."
2924165,2924164,2924166,19202,2,"    Good morning and welcome._x000D_
    Today's hearing--the subcommittee's first hearing in the 114th _x000D_
Congress--is about documenting the history of Russian aggression in _x000D_
Ukraine and Eastern Europe and making sure that we, here in America, _x000D_
fully understand how dire the situation truly is. We need to face harsh _x000D_
reality and the fact that Ukraine needs our help in the form of _x000D_
defensive lethal military equipment, and it needs that help today._x000D_
    In March 2014, with hardly any pushback from the West, Crimea was _x000D_
annexed by Russia. Prime Minister Yatsenyuk came to America last year _x000D_
asking for our help in his country's battle to ensure its territorial _x000D_
integrity. We should have immediately provided a minimal level of _x000D_
defensive lethal aid that Ukraine so desperately wanted. We should have _x000D_
taken it a step further by asking, ``What else do you need?'' America _x000D_
needed to show resolve then, and it desperately needs to show _x000D_
leadership and strength now, not only in Ukraine but around the world._x000D_
    On December 5, 1994, the Budapest Memorandum was signed by Ukraine, _x000D_
Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. In this agreement, _x000D_
Ukraine gave up the world's third-largest nuclear weapons stockpile in _x000D_
return for security assurances against threats or the use of force _x000D_
against its territorial integrity and political independence. Only 20 _x000D_
years later, Russia has blatantly broken its promise by brazenly _x000D_
violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine._x000D_
    No one should be surprised by this behavior from Russian President _x000D_
Vladimir Putin. Under his leadership, Russian aggression against its _x000D_
neighbors has been building for years. The summarized timeline of _x000D_
Russia's destabilizing actions detailed below clearly demonstrates the _x000D_
threat Putin represents to neighboring democracies._x000D_

    crossed a bridge near the Kremlin._x000D_
_x000D_
    Providing military equipment to Ukraine is not the only answer, but _x000D_
it is a necessary part of the answer. Ukraine needs economic and _x000D_
governance reforms, but those can succeed only in a peaceful and _x000D_
independent nation._x000D_
    We all heard President Poroshenko address a joint session of _x000D_
Congress on September 18, 2014, and plainly state that his country _x000D_
needs more military equipment. ``Blankets and night-vision goggles are _x000D_
important,'' he said, ``but one cannot win a war with blankets.'' He _x000D_
went on to say, ``Just like Israel, Ukraine has the right to defend her _x000D_
territory--and it will do so, with all the courage of her heart and _x000D_
dedication of her soul!'' The Ukrainian people are willing to fight for _x000D_
their country. They just need a little help from their allies in _x000D_
America._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on Russian _x000D_
aggression in Eastern Europe and learning how we can best support our _x000D_
allies in confronting this regional destabilization._x000D_
    Thank you. I look forward to your testimony._x000D_
_x000D_
    Again, I want to thank the witnesses, and I will turn it _x000D_
over to Senator Shaheen for her opening comments."
2924166,2924165,2924167,19202,2,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and _x000D_
thank you for your focus and work to bring this hearing _x000D_
together today. I want to echo your comments about the tragic _x000D_
killing of Boris Nemtsov. He was a tireless voice for all _x000D_
Russians and a firm believer in a bright future for the _x000D_
country. And even as we focus here on the Russian Federation's _x000D_
outward aggression, clearly we cannot ignore the repression _x000D_
that is happening inside Russia._x000D_
    In the interest of time, I will submit my full statement _x000D_
for the record, and just want to end by welcoming all of our _x000D_
witnesses here today, and it is nice to have former President _x000D_
Saakashvili back with this committee today. And I look forward _x000D_
to hearing what all of you have to say and your thoughts about _x000D_
what more we can be doing to support the people of Ukraine._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924167,2924166,2924168,19202,3,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson. I want to commend you for your focus _x000D_
and leadership on this critical foreign policy issue and for your work _x000D_
to bring this hearing together today before the Subcommittee on Europe. _x000D_
I also want to echo your comments about the tragic killing of Boris _x000D_
Nemtsov, who was a tireless voice for all Russians and a firm believer _x000D_
in a bright future for that country. Even as we focus here today on the _x000D_
Russia Federation's outward aggression, clearly, we cannot ignore the _x000D_
repression inside Russian today under President Putin. The Russian _x000D_
people and the world demand a transparent investigation into Mr. _x000D_
Nemtsov's murder and I sincerely hope we will see that. Russia's _x000D_
refusal to allow some foreign officials to attend his funeral was not a _x000D_
promising sign._x000D_
    As the Chairman noted, we have five impressive witnesses here to _x000D_
help us better understand Russia's pattern of interference and _x000D_
aggression in Eastern Europe and think through appropriate responses. I _x000D_
join the chairman in thanking you for appearing here today._x000D_
    Today, we see a Russian foreign policy that flouts international _x000D_
norms and responsibilities, a foreign policy that is based on _x000D_
political, economic, and even military intimidation and aggression. _x000D_
Airspace violations, disinformation and propaganda campaigns, energy _x000D_
corruption and trade restrictions are just a few of the tools used by _x000D_
Moscow._x000D_
    Through Operation Atlantic Resolve and, the European Reassurance _x000D_
Initiative, the U.S. is already providing substantial support to our _x000D_
European partners, including Ukraine. That support should continue. In _x000D_
fact, it should be increased. We should consistently look for _x000D_
opportunities to assist our friends in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, _x000D_
including helping them strengthen their political systems and economies _x000D_
through reform not for our benefit, but for the benefit of the people _x000D_
of those sovereign nations._x000D_
    Congress, and particularly this committee, has played a critical _x000D_
role in this effort. Just last December, Congress passed the Ukraine _x000D_
Freedom Support Act, which authorized the President to provide _x000D_
defensive military assistance to Ukraine and tighten economic sanctions _x000D_
on Russia. I hope the administration will make use of these _x000D_
authorities._x000D_
    I welcome your suggestions for what more we should be looking to do _x000D_
in Congress. Once again, thank you all for being here, and we look _x000D_
forward to hearing from each of you."
2924168,2924167,2924169,19202,3,"    Thank you, Senator Shaheen. We do have a _x000D_
vote that is going to be called, and I believe that what is _x000D_
going to happen with that vote is we are going to be sitting in _x000D_
our chairs. So what we will do is when that vote is called, we _x000D_
all will leave. We will put this hearing into recess, and we _x000D_
will come back because I do not want anybody to miss the _x000D_
testimony._x000D_
    But we will start off with President Saakashvili, former _x000D_
President of Georgia. He was the leader of Georgia from 2004 to _x000D_
2013. Recently, he was appointed by Ukrainian President _x000D_
Poroshenko to serve as chairman of the International Advisory _x000D_
Council on Reforms of the President of Ukraine. President _x000D_
Saakashvili?_x000D_
_x000D_
STATEMENT OF MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI, FORMER PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA, _x000D_
  AND CHAIRMAN, INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON REFORMS OF _x000D_
              PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, KIEV, UKRAINE"
2924169,2924168,2924170,19202,4,"    Thank you, Mr. President. Do we have time?_x000D_
    Voice. Votes just started."
2924170,2924169,2924171,19202,4,"    Okay. We will recess at this point in time _x000D_
and hopefully be back in about 10 to 15 minutes. So, again, I _x000D_
apologize for that, but, again, this is an important hearing, _x000D_
and we are looking forward to your testimony._x000D_
    Thank you. This hearing stands in recess."
2924171,2924170,2924172,19202,5,"    This hearing is called back to order. Our _x000D_
next witness will be Mr. Garry Kasparov. He is the chairman of _x000D_
the International Council of the Human Rights Foundation. Mr. _x000D_
Kasparov is a Russian pro-democracy leader, global human rights _x000D_
activist, author, and former world chess champion._x000D_
    Mr. Kasparov."
2924172,2924171,2924173,19202,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Kasparov._x000D_
    Our next witness is Dr. Stephen Blank. He is a senior _x000D_
fellow for Russia at the American Foreign Policy Council. He is _x000D_
an internationally known expert on Russia and the former Soviet _x000D_
Union, and is the author of over 1,000 publications._x000D_
    Dr. Blank."
2924173,2924172,2924174,19202,7,"    Thank you, Dr. Blank._x000D_
    Our next witness is Mr. Damon Wilson. He is executive vice _x000D_
president of the Atlantic Council. His areas of expertise _x000D_
include Central and Eastern Europe, NATO, and U.S. national _x000D_
security issues. From 2007 to 2009, Mr. Wilson served as _x000D_
special assistant to the President and senior director for _x000D_
European affairs at the National Security Council._x000D_
    Mr. Wilson."
2924174,2924173,2924175,19202,8,"    Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Our final witness _x000D_
is the Honorable Steven Pifer. Am I pronouncing that correctly?"
2924175,2924174,2924176,19202,8,"    Good. Mr. Pifer is a senior fellow at the _x000D_
Brookings Institute and was a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine _x000D_
from 1998 to 2000. He is a retired Foreign Service officer with _x000D_
over 25 years at the State Department focused on United States _x000D_
relations with the former Soviet Union and Europe._x000D_
    Mr. Pifer."
2924176,2924175,2924177,19202,9,"    Thank you, Ambassador Pifer. I would like _x000D_
to start my questioning with President Saakashvili. You _x000D_
obviously have firsthand experience with Russian aggression. _x000D_
Can you just describe the events of August 2008 and what _x000D_
prompted Vladimir Putin to stop advancing into Georgia?"
2924177,2924176,2924178,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Kasparov, we _x000D_
hear frequently that we are trying to offer off ramps to _x000D_
Vladimir Putin. Do you believe Vladimir Putin is looking for _x000D_
any off ramps whatsoever?"
2924178,2924177,2924179,19202,9,"    Thank you. You know, we have all heard of _x000D_
the little green men. Do any of the witnesses have any kind of _x000D_
intelligence estimates in terms of what Russia has committed to _x000D_
Eastern Ukraine, how many troops, what type of equipment? Well, _x000D_
let me go to Dr. Blank."
2924179,2924178,2924180,19202,9,    President Saakashvili.
2924180,2924179,2924181,19202,9,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Shaheen."
2924181,2924180,2924182,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Pifer, _x000D_
I understand that you and a number of your colleagues have _x000D_
recently released a report on the Ukrainian crisis. And one of _x000D_
the cases that you make in that report is the importance of _x000D_
providing military assistance to Ukraine, including defensive _x000D_
lethal weapons and light antiarmor weapons. Can you tell this _x000D_
panel more about the case that you make in that report and why _x000D_
you believe this is important?"
2924182,2924181,2924183,19202,9,"    And, Mr. Wilson, since the Atlantic _x000D_
Council was part of that report, can I ask you to comment on _x000D_
that, as well as respond to the concerns that have been raised _x000D_
by Germany and France about the potential for escalation of the _x000D_
situation in Ukraine if we provide defensive weapons?"
2924183,2924182,2924184,19202,9,"    And do you have any insights into at what _x000D_
point, if at all, Germany and France might change their view _x000D_
about the importance of providing weapons?"
2924184,2924183,2924185,19202,9,"    So you do not see that if Russia continues _x000D_
to violate this Minsk II agreement and continues to provide _x000D_
material and people, that might encourage Chancellor Merkel and _x000D_
President Hollande to change their view? Does anybody--I mean, _x000D_
you are about to tell me that you do not think so, I assume."
2924185,2924184,2924186,19202,9,"    And does everybody else on the panel agree _x000D_
with that? Dr. Blank?"
2924186,2924185,2924187,19202,9,    Thank you. My time is up.
2924187,2924186,2924188,19202,9,    Senator Gardner.
2924188,2924187,2924189,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to _x000D_
the witnesses who are here today. I think it was shortly after _x000D_
the demise of the Soviet Union that President H.W. Bush had _x000D_
said, ``Europe: whole, free, and at peace.'' And now we see the _x000D_
complete rearrangement attempts by Russia to rearrange the _x000D_
post-cold-war world international order._x000D_
    We have seen a determined effort by brave soldiers in _x000D_
Ukraine to stand strong, fight valiantly, but obviously _x000D_
overwhelmed and over matched. We have seen questions in the _x000D_
Baltic States about our commitment. You and I, President _x000D_
Saakashvili, had a conversation about timing, promises made, _x000D_
and concern within the region, concern about the promises that _x000D_
the United States has made, morale within Ukraine, questions as _x000D_
to the resolve of NATO or whether NATO could withstand a _x000D_
challenge, if that is indeed the question before us._x000D_
    And so, your experience in Georgia, you talked to the _x000D_
chairman a little bit about your experience in Georgia. Mr. _x000D_
Wilson talked a little bit about the commitment of the _x000D_
international community. As President Poroshenko's advisor, as _x000D_
the person who has taken this role on internationally, do you _x000D_
believe that the international coalition exists and will stand _x000D_
with the United States to step up our efforts?"
2924189,2924188,2924190,19202,9,"    Ambassador Pifer, you mentioned in your _x000D_
testimony that the sanctions had not yet achieved their _x000D_
political goal. And you also then followed it up with we need _x000D_
to make it clear to Russia that its actions will have a cost. _x000D_
So I want to talk about what do you envision--what would indeed _x000D_
extract that political goal, and what would the cost be to _x000D_
Russia--needs to be reached?"
2924190,2924189,2924191,19202,9,"    And, Dr. Blank, in your written statement _x000D_
and in your testimony, how much time would we need in Ukraine _x000D_
for proper training with equipment from the United States?"
2924191,2924190,2924192,19202,9,"    And that is another question I want to _x000D_
ask. How much time do you think we have on this?"
2924192,2924191,2924193,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924193,2924192,2924194,19202,9,    Senator Murphy.
2924194,2924193,2924195,19202,9,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank _x000D_
you to all of you for being here today. I am supportive of _x000D_
extending defensive weapons to the Ukrainian Army, but I want _x000D_
to express now some questions regarding some reservations that _x000D_
I have about that position, but then just open with a comment _x000D_
regarding my frustration on this conversation._x000D_
    We are obsessed with this question of providing arms to the _x000D_
Ukrainians, and it matters. But it is obsessive within the _x000D_
American context because it is one of the few, if only, tools _x000D_
that we have to try to blunt and combat Russian aggression in _x000D_
the region. I was there at the height of the Maidan protests. I _x000D_
spent 2 hours sitting, talking to President Yanukovych and _x000D_
listening to him give a litany of perceived and real abuses _x000D_
that Europe and the United States had perpetuated against _x000D_
Ukraine._x000D_
    And the reality is that we had a long time to try to stop _x000D_
this from becoming a crisis, but because we are not resourced _x000D_
as a nation, because we hamstring ourselves when it comes to _x000D_
the tools that we could use to try to create greater _x000D_
partnerships with countries that are at risk of falling into _x000D_
the growing Russian sphere, we then are stuck with crises in _x000D_
which we know how to respond to because we know we have the _x000D_
ability to supply weapons._x000D_
    And so, in the fall I was in Belgrade on the day that Putin _x000D_
was coming into town to do an unprecedented display of military _x000D_
prowess through the central streets while our Ambassador was _x000D_
begging for a few thousand dollars from the Federal Government _x000D_
here to increase exchange programs with the United States, _x000D_
right? We are not doing what is necessary in and around the _x000D_
region to try to stop these crises from happening in the first _x000D_
place._x000D_
    And so, I think this is an incredibly important _x000D_
conversation, and I am glad that we are having this hearing. _x000D_
But we had better adopt a strategy soon to stop the next _x000D_
Ukraine from happening so that we are not caught in this _x000D_
crisis, which is a hard one to unwind._x000D_
    Here are the reservations that I have. First, let us admit _x000D_
that what we are talking about would be relatively _x000D_
unprecedented. We are talking about the overt arming of a _x000D_
country that is under military threat and occupation and _x000D_
invasion from the Russians. Let us just acknowledge that during _x000D_
the cold war when the Soviets were a much bigger threat to the _x000D_
United States than the Russians are today, we did not do this, _x000D_
whether it was the invasion of Hungary or the invasion of _x000D_
Afghanistan. Well, we used other tools. We did not at that time _x000D_
make the choice to provide overt arms to the Afghans or the _x000D_
Hungarians. I think the circumstances are different today, and _x000D_
so I am supportive of defensive weapons. But this is not a no-_x000D_
brainer. This would be a change in the policy that we have _x000D_
traditionally observed over the long course of the last 100 _x000D_
years._x000D_
    Here are my two reservations, and I will ask the first _x000D_
question to Mr. Pifer. Your report and all of your _x000D_
recommendations are predicated on the belief that the cost will _x000D_
be so high to Putin that he will change behavior. Whether or _x000D_
not this provokes him or not, what if the cost is not high _x000D_
enough? What if he continues to move forward and the first _x000D_
round of arms that we supply are not enough? What are you _x000D_
recommending? Are you recommending one batch of defensive _x000D_
weapons? Are you recommending that we stage our supply line to _x000D_
them to respond to the moves that the Russians make? What is _x000D_
our endgame? When is enough too much?"
2924195,2924194,2924196,19202,9,"    Let me just ask my second question quickly, _x000D_
Damon. You talk about the fact that some European allies would _x000D_
support us, some would not. Putin has a lot of goals here, but _x000D_
one of them is to break Europe. And so, this would be _x000D_
convenient for him to have half of Europe supporting defensive _x000D_
weapons, half not. What is the potential consequences of Europe _x000D_
not being together on this? As many have said, the ultimate win _x000D_
here is that the Russian economy suffers under the tremendous _x000D_
weight of the sanctions such that it changes his position. But _x000D_
are we not going to risk losing countries like the Czech _x000D_
Republic, or the Hungarians, or the Greeks if we start to split _x000D_
over issues of military arming, or can we hold folks together _x000D_
on everything else besides the question of defensive weapons?"
2924196,2924195,2924197,19202,9,    Mr. Kasparov.
2924197,2924196,2924198,19202,9,"    I do not disagree. I think that is a very _x000D_
good point._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924198,2924197,2924199,19202,9,    Sure.
2924199,2924198,2924200,19202,9,    Senator Kaine. Thanks for your patience.
2924200,2924199,2924201,19202,9,"    Absolutely. It has all been educational, and _x000D_
thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all the witnesses._x000D_
    Three topics. First on the sanctions and economic effect on _x000D_
Russia right now, it sounds as if one of the takeaways from _x000D_
today should be work that we need to do with Europe to make _x000D_
sure the annual re-up of the sanctions, you know, the _x000D_
continuity has got to be our message, our very strong message _x000D_
to the Europeans. And I gather that everybody is on board with _x000D_
that. We need to do more on our side. The President did more _x000D_
today, and there is more that Congress can do._x000D_
    But I am particularly interested in the low cost of oil as _x000D_
a perennial problem for the Russian economy. And it is not just _x000D_
a problem for the Russian economy. It is also a problem for the _x000D_
Iranian economy, which is a separate topic. That is a very _x000D_
important issue for us now._x000D_
    What are other things we can do in the energy space, _x000D_
whether it is sanctions or whether it is assisting European _x000D_
nations with energy technologies? We have had a fairly _x000D_
contentious debate on this committee about things like LNG _x000D_
exports, even to send the signal that that would be something _x000D_
we would contemplate into the region to help nations break _x000D_
their need to rely too much on energy. Talk a little bit about _x000D_
low energy costs and what we ought to be doing to continue to _x000D_
pressure the Russian economy using that as a strategy, please, _x000D_
Dr. Blank."
2924201,2924200,2924202,19202,9,    Other thoughts on the energy space?
2924202,2924201,2924203,19202,9,    Right.
2924203,2924202,2924204,19202,9,"    Mr. Kasparov, I wanted to ask you a _x000D_
question. You want to comment on that before I ask you the _x000D_
question?"
2924204,2924203,2924205,19202,9,"    I agree with you. I think there is a _x000D_
psychological impact. And even if you knew LNG would not get _x000D_
there for 2 years, you start to do things that sends a message, _x000D_
and similarly with energy sanctions. I am a big supporter of _x000D_
sanctions in the energy space. That is the lever that is being _x000D_
used. That is where we ought to sanction._x000D_
    Mr. Kasparov, I wanted to switch to another topic, which _x000D_
is, you know, we tend to look at these things through the eyes _x000D_
of political people. From your experience, what will it take? _x000D_
What are the kinds of conditions that will cause Vladimir Putin _x000D_
to lose political support within his electorate, within Russian _x000D_
citizens, because there is outside pressure, but the most _x000D_
effective pressure is often the inside pressure when the _x000D_
population starts to pull their support from you._x000D_
    You talked about the propaganda regime, et cetera, makes it _x000D_
difficult for the message to get through. But from your _x000D_
experience, what will cause a decrease in the domestic _x000D_
political support for Vladimir Putin?"
2924205,2924204,2924206,19202,9,"    Okay, Mr. Chairman, if others wanted to _x000D_
weigh in on that question. I do not have any other questions, _x000D_
but I would love to hear their responses."
2924206,2924205,2924207,19202,9,    Mr. Blank.
2924207,2924206,2924208,19202,9,    Ambassador Pifer.
2924208,2924207,2924209,19202,9,    Mr. President.
2924209,2924208,2924210,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924210,2924209,2924211,19202,9,"    Thank you, Senator Kaine. I would like to _x000D_
go back to the story. I would like somebody to talk to the _x000D_
courage of the Ukrainian people. Senator Murphy talked about _x000D_
being in the Maidan. I was heartened, I was encouraged by my _x000D_
colleagues here in the Senate and the House unanimously passing _x000D_
the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which did authorize lethal _x000D_
defense weaponry for the courageous people of Ukraine. The _x000D_
reason I think we did that is because so many of us went over _x000D_
there. I was with Senator Murphy with a bipartisan delegation, _x000D_
about eight U.S. Senators, and we walked the Maidan. We heard _x000D_
the story of the sniper attack._x000D_
    I would like to hear the story of the rebellion, the _x000D_
pushback from the Ukrainian military that had been hollowed out _x000D_
purposefully, but also the courage of the Ukrainian people _x000D_
defending themselves, turning the tide, and then having that _x000D_
tide turned back against them because of Russian involvement, _x000D_
the Russia's invasion with 14,000 to 20,000 troops and heavy _x000D_
weapons. I want to enter those pictures into the record."
2924211,2924210,2924212,19202,9,"    I want somebody to speak to that--somebody _x000D_
to answer the question--to answer the plea of President _x000D_
Poroshenko when he came before a joint session of this Congress _x000D_
and said that blankets and night vision goggles are important, _x000D_
he said, but one cannot win a war with blankets._x000D_
    Can somebody here just talk about what has happened in the _x000D_
military campaign against the rebels, how the tide had turned, _x000D_
how it had been turned back again, and then how desperate the _x000D_
situation is? One of the reasons I held this hearing this week, _x000D_
kind of rushed it, is because we heard last week that there was _x000D_
potentially an offensive being planned within the next few _x000D_
weeks. We heard that earlier, potentially a spring offensive._x000D_
    Can somebody just talk about the history of this military _x000D_
conflict, this rebellion, what will likely happen and how _x000D_
desperate the situation is?"
2924212,2924211,2924213,19202,9,"    Anybody else just want to speak to the _x000D_
courage of the Ukrainian people and why they need to be _x000D_
supported?"
2924213,2924212,2924214,19202,9,"    I will let everybody else summarize. I _x000D_
want to be respectful of Senator Shaheen. She has a question, _x000D_
and then I will let everybody wrap up and give my final _x000D_
thoughts."
2924214,2924213,2924215,19202,9,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I _x000D_
wanted to go back to the economic concerns because one of you I _x000D_
think--I am not sure who--suggested that support for weapons _x000D_
may be moot if the economy fails in Ukraine before that _x000D_
happens. And I know that the IMF has pledged funding as has the _x000D_
EU and the United States, of course._x000D_
    But to what extent can the Ukrainian economy, and President _x000D_
Poroshenko, and the government survive the reforms that are _x000D_
being asked of it, and keep the economy afloat, and continue _x000D_
this military conflict at the same time? And what more can the _x000D_
United States do to help with that? Damon, do you want to _x000D_
start?"
2924215,2924214,2924216,19202,9,"    Anyone else want to comment on that? _x000D_
Ambassador Pifer and then Dr. Blank."
2924216,2924215,2924217,19202,9,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Dr. Blank."
2924217,2924216,2924218,19202,9,"    I certainly agree with that. We have sent _x000D_
mixed signals, and I would hope that Ukraine would know that we _x000D_
are behind them 100 percent. I do hope that this Congress can _x000D_
pass the reforms to the IMF, too, because that would allow us _x000D_
additional assistance as we are looking where can we provide _x000D_
economic assistance to Ukraine._x000D_
    President Saakashvili."
2924218,2924217,2924219,19202,9,"    Well, thank you all very much for your _x000D_
compelling testimony and for your continued focus on Ukraine. _x000D_
And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing."
2924219,2924218,2924220,19202,9,"    Thank you, and I want to thank all of my _x000D_
colleagues for attending. I will just give everybody a chance _x000D_
to quickly wrap up. We will go in reverse order. We will start _x000D_
with Ambassador Pifer. If there is something that you have not _x000D_
been able to get out, please say it."
2924220,2924219,2924221,19202,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Mr. Wilson, one _x000D_
final thought?"
2924221,2924220,2924222,19202,9,"    Thank you. President Obama said we are the _x000D_
indispensable Nation. In addition to looking to Europe, the _x000D_
other aspiration really was a corruption free Ukraine. It is a _x000D_
combination of both of those elements that created that _x000D_
courage._x000D_
    Dr. Blank."
2924222,2924221,2924223,19202,9,"    Thank you, Doctor._x000D_
    Mr. Kasparov."
2924223,2924222,2924224,19202,9,"    We have unilateral desires when it comes _x000D_
to providing information and the truth. President Saakashvili, _x000D_
any final thoughts?"
2924224,2924223,2924225,19202,9,"    Well, again, I want to thank all of the _x000D_
witnesses for your time, your thoughtful testimony, as Dr. _x000D_
Blank said, for telling the truth, and for just fighting for _x000D_
freedom._x000D_
    The record will remain open until the close of business on _x000D_
March 11, one week from today, for questions for the record."
2924225,2924224,2924226,19202,9,    This hearing is adjourned.
2924226,2924225,2924227,19203,1,"    I will call the meeting to order._x000D_
    In June 2014, this committee held a hearing on the future _x000D_
of United States-China relations. At that time, I raised _x000D_
concerns over the lack of a coherent China policy, including _x000D_
the absence of sustained high-level engagement from senior _x000D_
administration officials despite the consistent rhetoric that _x000D_
the United States-China relationship is one of the most _x000D_
consequential relationships for United States political, _x000D_
security, and economic interests._x000D_
    I left that hearing scratching my head. And after nearly a _x000D_
year later, I am even more troubled._x000D_
    Yesterday, this committee convened to discuss a new nuclear _x000D_
cooperation agreement with China. We heard troubling _x000D_
information about the Chinese intent to divert U.S. technology _x000D_
for military purposes. In addition, we were told that China has _x000D_
not taken adequate steps to end proliferation of sensitive _x000D_
technologies by Chinese entities and individuals to countries _x000D_
of concern, including Iran and North Korea._x000D_
    Despite these concerns, administration officials testified _x000D_
in support of a new nuclear cooperation agreement, noting the _x000D_
mutual benefits for the bilateral relationship, including _x000D_
commercial interests._x000D_
    This afternoon, the absence of a genuine China policy will _x000D_
be on display as we discuss the situation in the East and South _x000D_
China Seas where China continues to engage in provocative and _x000D_
destabilizing behavior._x000D_
    As you can see from these pictures on display, China _x000D_
continues to engage in land reclamation and construction _x000D_
activities, the scope and scale of which are unprecedented in _x000D_
the South China Sea._x000D_
    Figure 1 shows Fiery Cross Reef, in the Spratly Islands, as _x000D_
it appeared on May 2014. Figure 2 shows that same reef less _x000D_
than a year later with over 1,300 meters of runway already _x000D_
completed and analyst assessments that it could be expanded up _x000D_
to 3,100 meters._x000D_
    Clearly, these activities are not simply limited to _x000D_
dredging and piling sand. China is deliberately constructing _x000D_
facilities on these reefs and islets that could be used for _x000D_
military purposes, including airstrips and ports, as you can _x000D_
see in Figure 3, which shows Fiery Cross Reef just a few weeks _x000D_
ago. Again, in Figure 4, you can see large, multistory _x000D_
buildings with additional military capabilities._x000D_
    Moreover, Beijing has publicly confirmed that there are _x000D_
military uses for these facilities, with China's foreign _x000D_
ministry spokesperson stating on March 9 that this construction _x000D_
was undertaken in part to satisfy the necessary military _x000D_
defense needs._x000D_
    It is worth noting that all of these activities are _x000D_
occurring against the backdrop of China's massive military _x000D_
buildup, including significant investments in the antiaccess/_x000D_
area-denial capabilities._x000D_
    Most China watchers believe that Beijing does not want to _x000D_
start a conflict in either the East or South China Seas. Yet _x000D_
many of the same experts concede that Beijing may do everything _x000D_
short of engaging in a military conflict to solidify its _x000D_
claims._x000D_
    That is why I recently joined Senators McCain, Reed, and _x000D_
Menendez in a bipartisan letter to Secretary Kerry and _x000D_
Secretary Carter to highlight our growing concerns with China's _x000D_
efforts to alter the status quo through ongoing land _x000D_
reclamation and construction activities in the South China Sea._x000D_
    According to the most recent statistics, some $5 trillion _x000D_
in global ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea _x000D_
annually. As you can see from Figure 5, all of the major trade _x000D_
routes through the South China Sea pass near disputed areas in _x000D_
both the Spratlys and Paracels. And you can see those circled _x000D_
on this display._x000D_
    I hope we will be able to have a thoughtful discussion _x000D_
today that outlines U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and how _x000D_
Chinese actions in the East and South China Seas affect, if at _x000D_
all, the balance of the United States-China bilateral _x000D_
relationship._x000D_
    In addition, I hope we will explore various options _x000D_
available to the United States to ensure that the situation in _x000D_
the East and South China Seas does not result in a conflict. I _x000D_
support efforts to constructively engage with China, including _x000D_
strengthening economic and trade ties._x000D_
    Yet simply defaulting to an approach that maintains _x000D_
cooperation while managing differences with China is not a _x000D_
successful formula, particularly when such management cedes _x000D_
United States influence and places American interests at risk _x000D_
in the Indo-Pacific._x000D_
    I am concerned that absent a course correction, _x000D_
specifically high-level and dedicated engagement from the _x000D_
United States Government to articulate a coherent China policy, _x000D_
our credibility will continue to suffer throughout the region, _x000D_
whether it is in regards to nonproliferation or preserving _x000D_
freedom of navigation in the East and South China Seas._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and thank them _x000D_
for being here._x000D_
    And now I look forward to hearing from our distinguished _x000D_
ranking member."
2924227,2924226,2924228,19203,1,"    Well, thank you, Chairman Corker. I _x000D_
appreciate you very much holding this hearing. This is a very, _x000D_
very important hearing._x000D_
    The relationship between the United States and China is _x000D_
critically important to this country. It is a complex _x000D_
relationship._x000D_
    Yesterday, we held a hearing on our civil nuclear _x000D_
cooperation, and I thought that hearing brought out many points _x000D_
that were extremely important to follow up on. Today's hearing _x000D_
dealing with the security in the South China Sea and East China _x000D_
Sea is equally important, and China plays a critical role in _x000D_
regard to maritime security issues._x000D_
    So it is a very important hearing, and I thank you for _x000D_
conducting this._x000D_
    There are clearly differences in the claims of territorial _x000D_
rights in the China seas. The important thing, though, is to _x000D_
have an effective mechanism to deal with maritime disputes. _x000D_
That needs to be our key policy objective. And I know President _x000D_
Obama has underscored the importance of effective mechanisms _x000D_
for dealing with the maritime disputes._x000D_
    Provocative conduct is not helpful at all, and we have seen _x000D_
more and more of these provocative incidents. China, _x000D_
particularly, has been very much responsible for taking actions _x000D_
that make the circumstances much more dangerous._x000D_
    Ambassador Shear, when I was in Vietnam, that was the most _x000D_
important issue that was brought up to me, the concern that _x000D_
Vietnam's future was very much at risk due to the oil rig _x000D_
activity that China was doing in areas that Vietnam had _x000D_
reasonable rights to make claims that that was their territory._x000D_
    Unilateral action by China caused a major problem at the _x000D_
time that could have escalated even more than it did. But that _x000D_
was not the only time. The reclamation efforts that Senator _x000D_
Corker is talking about, in an effort to gain more territorial _x000D_
and maritime claims, is a provocative action by China today._x000D_
    You mentioned Fiery Cross, where construction and _x000D_
reclamation has increased the size by elevenfold since August _x000D_
of last year. We can also talk about Gaven Reef, where 14,000 _x000D_
square meters have been constructed since March 2014, or _x000D_
Johnson Reef, where there have been 100,000 square meters in an _x000D_
area that was submerged before, all this in an effort to really _x000D_
change the equation in the region by taking unilateral actions._x000D_
    What this does is it clearly affects the stability of the _x000D_
region and jeopardizes the free flow of commerce. So the United _x000D_
States has a direct interest in this and we must do everything _x000D_
we can to resolve these issues peacefully._x000D_
    China is not the only country that has taken provocative _x000D_
action, but they are the largest. And they are the ones who _x000D_
have been the most bold in taking these actions. There are _x000D_
conflicts over overlapping territorial claims by nations in the _x000D_
region, with China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and _x000D_
Vietnam also making claims, often conflicting, to islands, _x000D_
reefs, and shoals in the South China Sea. And then there are _x000D_
China and Taiwan also asserting their rights, a whole lot of _x000D_
them through expansive nine-dash line territorial claims._x000D_
    In the East China Sea, it is clear United States policy _x000D_
that although we do not take a position on the ultimate _x000D_
sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, the Senkakus are under _x000D_
Japan's administrative control, and we oppose unilateral _x000D_
efforts by third parties to change the status quo. Nonetheless, _x000D_
China has asserted a claim to the Senkakus._x000D_
    So what can we do? And what should the United States be _x000D_
doing? First and foremost, we believe it is essential for all _x000D_
parties to exercise self-restraint to avoid making the _x000D_
situation worse._x000D_
    The use of coercion, threats, or force to assert disputed _x000D_
claims in the region or to seek a change in the current status _x000D_
quo is just not acceptable._x000D_
    We have been working with the ASEAN organization to develop _x000D_
a code of conduct for resolving maritime disputes. It is not _x000D_
clear whether China will participate or not. They certainly _x000D_
have not been cooperative in developing a code of conduct that _x000D_
would allow for the rule of law, orderly processes to deal with _x000D_
disputes and not taking unilateral action._x000D_
    I think it is important that we continue to urge the ASEAN _x000D_
members to come up with a code of conduct, a gold standard for _x000D_
resolving these issues, even if China does not participate. We _x000D_
will at least have a gold standard for how to deal with this._x000D_
    I think we need to redouble our efforts to work with the _x000D_
Asia-Pacific region to develop a functional problem-solving _x000D_
architecture that could support the resolution of disputes _x000D_
through a collaborative diplomatic process consistent with the _x000D_
recognized principles of international law._x000D_
    Let me also point out there are other things that we can _x000D_
do. The United States can play a significant role in bolstering _x000D_
the region's maritime security capacity, including maritime _x000D_
domain awareness, and help contribute to effective regional _x000D_
management of maritime security issues._x000D_
    Finally, the United States must continue to demonstrate an _x000D_
enduring commitment to the region and an enduring presence _x000D_
there._x000D_
    We will stand by our treaty allies. We will deepen our _x000D_
partnership in the region. And we will continue the operations _x000D_
by our Armed Forces in support of freedom of navigation, the _x000D_
maintenance of peace and stability, and respect of _x000D_
international law._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, let me just say lastly, it may not be _x000D_
directly on point, but I do think the fact that we have never _x000D_
ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty does not give us the full _x000D_
standing in this area where we could have a strong position. I _x000D_
know that there is controversy, which I do not fully _x000D_
understand, but I do believe that the United States has been a _x000D_
leader in maritime security issues. And our presence in the _x000D_
China seas is critically important to maintain stability._x000D_
    I just think we would have stronger standing if we would _x000D_
join other nations that have already ratified the Law of the _x000D_
Sea Treaty, and that would give us an even stronger standing._x000D_
    I want to welcome both of our witnesses here today. _x000D_
Secretary Russel and I worked together in the last Congress _x000D_
when I chaired the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee that _x000D_
Senator Gardner now chairs. Secretary Russel has been an _x000D_
incredibly valuable partner with us in the rebalance to Asia, _x000D_
and we thank you very much for your help._x000D_
    And Ambassador Shear has been a great servant of the public _x000D_
and now in his position as Assistant Secretary of Defense._x000D_
    It is a pleasure to have both of you before our committee._x000D_
    The Chairman Thank you for those comments._x000D_
    I would never want to get in a tit-for-tat with the _x000D_
outstanding ranking member, who I respect so much and enjoy _x000D_
working with. I will say that China is a signatory to the Law _x000D_
of the Sea Treaty and it does not seem to be having a very _x000D_
positive effect, so I do not know that you can say one plus one _x000D_
equals two, in that particular case."
2924228,2924227,2924229,19203,1,"    I do not want to argue with my chairman, _x000D_
but if we were to ratify it, we might be able to use that _x000D_
mechanism more effectively with China._x000D_
    The Chairman Yes, I got it._x000D_
    Anyway, thank you so much._x000D_
    Our first witness is the Honorable Danny Russel, Assistant _x000D_
Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. We thank you for _x000D_
being here, and thank you for your service to our country._x000D_
    Our second witness, the Honorable David Shear, Assistant _x000D_
Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs. We _x000D_
also thank you for being here, and thank you for your public _x000D_
service._x000D_
    If you will, I think you know the drill, make some brief _x000D_
comments that you think are very important to our discussion _x000D_
openly here today. Your entire testimony will be entered into _x000D_
the record, and we look forward to the Q&A. Thank you very _x000D_
much."
2924229,2924228,2924230,19203,3,"    With the bilateral relationship that we have _x000D_
with China and the economic interests that we have there, does _x000D_
that stifle us from being a little bit more engaged directly in _x000D_
this issue?"
2924230,2924229,2924231,19203,3,"    Secretary Russel, I assume that you are _x000D_
referring to the 10 leaders of ASEAN's statement during the _x000D_
recent meeting where they said that China's actions, ``eroded _x000D_
trust and confidence and may undermine peace, security, and _x000D_
stability in the South China Sea.''"
2924231,2924230,2924232,19203,3,"    See, I looked at that as a weak statement, _x000D_
not a strong statement. I was looking for a stronger action by _x000D_
ASEAN. Am I wrong? Were we satisfied with the response?"
2924232,2924231,2924233,19203,3,"    I wish I had you as one of my professors in _x000D_
college grading my papers. I think you are being pretty gentle._x000D_
    We have been waiting for ASEAN for a long time on this code _x000D_
of conduct, and I understand we have limited ability to control _x000D_
the way that they proceed on this, but can you just give me _x000D_
your observation, whether we can anticipate that they will, in _x000D_
fact, move ahead with a code of conduct that would be _x000D_
considered the gold standard as to how these disputes should be _x000D_
handled, from the point of view of eliminating these _x000D_
provocative type actions that have taken place?"
2924233,2924232,2924234,19203,3,"    But I would anticipate that, under a code _x000D_
of conduct, there would be established avenues for resolving _x000D_
disputes other than taking unilateral action, but maybe we are _x000D_
asking for too much. It seems to me that the ASEAN countries _x000D_
have been talking about this for a long time._x000D_
    And I am not as satisfied as you are on the progress that _x000D_
we have seen to date, and I just hope that they can get their _x000D_
act together to give us some hope._x000D_
    Secretary Shear, if I might, in your statement, both _x000D_
written and oral, you spoke about our military alignments in _x000D_
the region, the types of deployments and the types of exercises _x000D_
that we have had._x000D_
    Is this a direct response to additional challenges that _x000D_
could be there because of maritime security concerns? And do we _x000D_
have enough assets and resources to deal with the potential _x000D_
threat in that region?_x000D_
    We do have certain obligations, certain treaty obligations, _x000D_
that the President has underscored. Do we have the facilities _x000D_
or the assets in place to deal with these potential problems?"
2924234,2924233,2924235,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    The Chairman Senator Gardner."
2924235,2924234,2924236,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to _x000D_
the witnesses today._x000D_
    This is an important hearing as we try to understand _x000D_
intentions in an area of the world where we are trying to grow _x000D_
our opportunity as well._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, this is a very interesting conversation. It _x000D_
is clear, though, that the People's Republic of China's _x000D_
destabilizing activities in the East China Sea and South China _x000D_
Sea, including what can only be described as a unilaterally _x000D_
imposed Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea _x000D_
or the inexplicable nine-dash line of sovereignty claims that _x000D_
encompass 90 percent of the South China Sea, are a threat to _x000D_
the stability in the region and create a serious challenge to _x000D_
the United States rebalance policy in the Asia-Pacific._x000D_
    These activities are contrary to China's own, to their very _x000D_
own past pledges and are possibly violations of international _x000D_
law, as we have said._x000D_
    These actions also threaten the freedom of navigation and _x000D_
sea lanes that are vital to global commerce, and also create an _x000D_
unstable security environment where unintended escalation and _x000D_
military confrontation in the region becomes likely, with dire _x000D_
consequences for all parties involved._x000D_
    But as we contemplate policy options to address Beijing's _x000D_
actions, we also need to understand their intentions, questions _x000D_
like: Are these actions a show of force intended to intimidate _x000D_
China's smaller neighbors? Are they intended to deter the _x000D_
United States, especially in the Asia pivot policy? Are they _x000D_
driven by economic considerations?_x000D_
    The United States has been the guarantor of peace and _x000D_
prosperity in the region for generations, and we cannot remain _x000D_
complacent in light of these very serious challenges._x000D_
    So to Assistant Secretary Russel, in your testimony you _x000D_
stated, under international law, it is clear that no amount of _x000D_
dredging or construction will alter or enhance the legal _x000D_
strength of a nation's territorial claims. No matter how much _x000D_
sand you pile on a reef in the South China Sea, you cannot _x000D_
manufacture sovereignty._x000D_
    Just a couple questions. Could you clarify the legal basis _x000D_
that China is claiming that it has, just talk about the legal _x000D_
basis for its claims? Are they trying to create facts on the _x000D_
ground in this area, hoping that the international community _x000D_
will eventually just say that it is recognized? And do you see _x000D_
any similarities of China's actions to other territorial _x000D_
disputes in the region around the world?"
2924236,2924235,2924237,19203,3,"    We have the upcoming United States-China _x000D_
strategic and economic dialogue this summer. Does the President _x000D_
plan to personally discuss this issue with President Xi in _x000D_
September?"
2924237,2924236,2924238,19203,3,"    I do not want to blur the two, but it is _x000D_
also something that will be brought up at the United States-_x000D_
China strategic and economic dialogue in the summer, correct?"
2924238,2924237,2924239,19203,3,"    Very good._x000D_
    A couple of comments you made in your testimony that I _x000D_
wanted to follow up on, and I do not remember, I am sorry, _x000D_
Secretary Shear, if this is something you had said or Secretary _x000D_
Russel had said this, but it is China's behavior we are _x000D_
influencing was the response to one question. It was also said _x000D_
that China is already paying a significant price for their _x000D_
behavior._x000D_
    So the comment that was made of China's behavior that we _x000D_
are influencing, if I could get an example--and I think the _x000D_
chairman was trying to get at this question as well--if I could _x000D_
get an example of where China has changed behavior as a result _x000D_
of us trying to influence that behavior, that would be great. _x000D_
And then on the significant price, I want to follow up on that._x000D_
    So if I can get an example of where China's behavior has _x000D_
changed as a result of these actions."
2924239,2924238,2924240,19203,3,"    So we have the withdrawal of the oil rig. _x000D_
What other behaviors have we influenced?"
2924240,2924239,2924241,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    The Chairman Senator Murphy."
2924241,2924240,2924242,19203,3,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking _x000D_
Member. Thank you to our panelists._x000D_
    Over the last couple years, I spent a lot of time in and _x000D_
around Ukraine, as have the chairman and ranking member. It is _x000D_
interesting to me some of the parallels with respect to which _x000D_
Russia's actions in Ukraine look sometimes very much like _x000D_
China's actions in the South and East China Seas._x000D_
    So I wanted to ask a couple questions about whether I am _x000D_
right to understand some parallels here. Clearly, Russia _x000D_
engaged in provocations in eastern Ukraine, up until this day, _x000D_
that involve a thin veneer of separation between themselves and _x000D_
the separatists slowly moving into eastern Ukraine, little _x000D_
green men who are clearly connected and controlling the _x000D_
separatists, in the same way China is being very careful about _x000D_
what they do._x000D_
    But as they move forward these white-hulled ships rather _x000D_
than these grey-hulled ships, they are actually exerting some _x000D_
additional control over the territory without militarizing the _x000D_
conflict. It seems to me some of the same activities that the _x000D_
Russians are undertaking._x000D_
    My first question, though, is about the extent to which _x000D_
China is watching what is happening today in and around _x000D_
Ukraine. A lot of us have worried that a lack of a robust _x000D_
response from the United States and Europe in Ukraine kind of _x000D_
sets this new set of rules in which you can reset your borders _x000D_
or territories that you control through channels other than _x000D_
diplomacy. And Russia clearly has gotten away with that thus _x000D_
far._x000D_
    Is China watching how the Western response plays out to _x000D_
Russia's aggression in Ukraine? Does our ability to send strong _x000D_
messages to Russian matter in terms of what China does next and _x000D_
what new provocations they may look to?"
2924242,2924241,2924243,19203,3,"    Another frequent topic of discussion with _x000D_
respect to Ukraine and Russia is the challenge that this kind _x000D_
of aggression presents to article 5 in NATO, the question as to _x000D_
whether and when our obligations are actually triggered should _x000D_
you see separatists break out inside the borders of a NATO _x000D_
country. There is fairly open talk about the definitions in _x000D_
article 5 and at what point the obligations are to be _x000D_
triggered._x000D_
    Do we have any similar concerns with respect to our _x000D_
treaties with the Philippines or with Japan with respect to _x000D_
some, again, movement of these white-hulled nonmilitary vessels _x000D_
that are engaging in this provocative behavior, which may not _x000D_
look military on its face? Or are we confident that we know _x000D_
exactly where that line ultimately is crossed that would _x000D_
trigger obligations from the United States under those _x000D_
treaties?"
2924243,2924242,2924244,19203,3,"    Is that to mean you do not read any _x000D_
ambiguity into the treaty or the potential provocations that _x000D_
would trigger obligations?"
2924244,2924243,2924245,19203,3,"    And I do not think that it is any sign of _x000D_
weakness in an alliance or weakness within the scope of a _x000D_
treaty to admit that there are countries that are playing with _x000D_
security guarantees, that are being very careful not to cross _x000D_
lines, and thus precipitating conversations about different _x000D_
scenarios in which there might be a significant amount of grey _x000D_
as to whether or not these treaties become operative._x000D_
    Certainly, that is happening in NATO today. There are very _x000D_
open conversations about exactly what would trigger article 5, _x000D_
what would not. I do not think anybody sees any weakness in it._x000D_
    It sounds like you are doing the same thing. I would just _x000D_
encourage it so that we are not surprised by an action that _x000D_
causes us to meditate for too long on whether or not these _x000D_
treaties require our action."
2924245,2924244,2924246,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    The Chairman Senator Perdue."
2924246,2924245,2924247,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    I agree with the President's rebalancing strategy. It is a _x000D_
dangerous world out there, and I think our future, certainly, _x000D_
the 21st century has been characterized as the century of the _x000D_
Pacific, whereas the 20th century may have been the century of _x000D_
the Atlantic._x000D_
    Over the last 30 years, since China has really opened up, I _x000D_
have been blessed in my career, especially, to have lived there _x000D_
a couple times in the region. I worked in China a lot over the _x000D_
last 30 years. And I have watched United States engage China._x000D_
    And I do agree with that engagement policy. I hope we can _x000D_
continue that and use military engagement as well as economic _x000D_
engagement. It is a carrot-and-stick type of approach._x000D_
    Today, though, over the last 20 or 30 years, as their _x000D_
economy has grown and we have grown in terms of consuming their _x000D_
products, we have helped them develop a current account that is _x000D_
dramatically larger than ours, obviously. We have watched their _x000D_
economy grow such that today we have $18 trillion of debt. _x000D_
China and Japan together are the two largest country holders, _x000D_
second only to our own Federal Reserve._x000D_
    I am very concerned about our ability to continue to engage _x000D_
in a respectful way with China, given the size of our debt. _x000D_
Admiral Mullen, our past chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, _x000D_
said in 2011 that our own national debt is the greatest threat _x000D_
to our national security._x000D_
    With regard to Asia, and particularly China, how does that _x000D_
debt situation, the fact that they hold a lot of our debt, and _x000D_
I would ask both of you, both from an economic point of view _x000D_
and a military point of view, what does that to do our ability _x000D_
to deal with them straight up, particularly when we have _x000D_
tactical security issues?_x000D_
    Let me give you an example. It has been characterized that _x000D_
we have these, I think you said five, alliances in the region. _x000D_
One of those is Taiwan._x000D_
    We have an agreement with Taiwan that says if China invades _x000D_
Taiwan or attacks Taiwan, we have to come to Taiwan's defense _x000D_
and help defend Taiwan against China. But to do that, we have _x000D_
to go to China and borrow the money to go to Taiwan and help _x000D_
defend Taiwan against China._x000D_
    I just want to know the depth at which our own debt _x000D_
situation is hampering our ability to really engage China in a _x000D_
way that we need to over the next 30 years."
2924247,2924246,2924248,19203,3,"    They are very close, though. They go one _x000D_
and two, back and forth."
2924248,2924247,2924249,19203,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Secretary Shear, I would like to switch gears back. That is _x000D_
the economic side. The military side is that China has really _x000D_
increased their investment in their military, such that they _x000D_
are really moving into--I think this is directionally correct. _x000D_
They will be very soon spending about half of what we spend on _x000D_
our military._x000D_
    The fact that we have a two-theater strategy, and have had _x000D_
for some 60 years or so, if you just do the math, does that not _x000D_
give you concern that over time that that puts us in jeopardy, _x000D_
in terms of being able to project force in the region and _x000D_
affect behavior on the part of China?"
2924249,2924248,2924250,19203,3,"    I am sorry to interrupt. I only have a few _x000D_
seconds left. Could you talk specifically about the naval fleet _x000D_
and their increased investment in the aggressive shipbuilding _x000D_
program they have underway right now, and the long-term, 10-_x000D_
year impact of that on the balance of power in Asia?"
2924250,2924249,2924251,19203,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    The Chairman Thank you._x000D_
    I sit here listening and it brings me back to my opening _x000D_
comments about where we were headed before this meeting. I see _x000D_
no price whatsoever that China is paying for their activities _x000D_
in the South and East China Seas. None._x000D_
    As a matter of fact, I see the price being us paying a _x000D_
price. We are paying the price. We have our friends coming in _x000D_
constantly worried about where we are, what our commitment _x000D_
levels are, pointing out that our foreign military financing in _x000D_
the region is _x000D_
1 percent of what it is in the rest of the world. They question _x000D_
whether there really is any kind of pivot or rebalance._x000D_
    So I actually look at what China is doing right now, and I _x000D_
see them paying no price. I see us getting ready to enter into _x000D_
a 123 agreement knowing they are going to violate it. We see _x000D_
them violating international norms now, on this particular _x000D_
issue._x000D_
    You say that they are being criticized. Gosh, we all get _x000D_
criticized around here all the time. It does not affect our _x000D_
behavior._x000D_
    So tell me what price they are paying. I see none. I see us _x000D_
actually paying a price in our esteem in the region. I think _x000D_
that our friends are very concerned about us._x000D_
    And what I see when I visit the region is they see a _x000D_
dominant China, both economically and militarily, and I see _x000D_
them constantly in a state of almost trepidation as to doing _x000D_
anything that might offend them._x000D_
    Now, what the Philippines did was interesting, and I _x000D_
support their efforts in that regard. I know we are, as a _x000D_
country._x000D_
    But explain to me the balance here. I think we are the ones _x000D_
that are paying the price by no one seeing any kind of tangible _x000D_
activity relative to this, and they are actually gaining and _x000D_
paying no price."
2924251,2924250,2924252,19203,3,"    So let me talk a little bit about the _x000D_
impact of China's decision in 2013 to establish the Air Defense _x000D_
Identification Zone in the East China Sea. When that was done, _x000D_
there was a lot of concern. And then it looked like there was _x000D_
just about pragmatic acceptance, not acknowledging legitimacy, _x000D_
but not challenging the activities of flights over that zone._x000D_
    Can you just give me an update as to the status of flights _x000D_
in that zone, what is being done, and if there is a concern _x000D_
that China may make a similar declaration in the South China _x000D_
Sea?"
2924252,2924251,2924253,19203,3,"    Just so I have it clear, commercial flights _x000D_
that fly in that area are not complying with the Chinese _x000D_
requirements?"
2924253,2924252,2924254,19203,3,"    And if they----_x000D_
air traffic controller, regardless of----"
2924254,2924253,2924255,19203,3,"    But what is happening? Are they responding _x000D_
or not responding? Do we know?"
2924255,2924254,2924256,19203,3,"    That is what I thought they were doing, so _x000D_
in reality then, China is accomplishing its mission by what it _x000D_
did because they are, in fact, establishing a claim that is not _x000D_
legitimate but making it legitimate by time?_x000D_
    I understood you bristled a little bit at Senator Murphy's _x000D_
comparison between Russia and Ukraine. And I understand the _x000D_
differences, believe me. But I must tell you, when I was over _x000D_
in Asia, the Ukraine was mentioned frequently and concerns _x000D_
about China's unilateral actions were mentioned in the same _x000D_
paragraph._x000D_
    So if there is a de facto recognition of these zones as _x000D_
being effective in responding to the radio tower, because of _x000D_
the safety of the passengers, I fully understand that._x000D_
    Is that not an extremely dangerous precedent?"
2924256,2924255,2924257,19203,3,"    And do we believe there is any intention of _x000D_
China to do a similar zone in the South China Sea?"
2924257,2924256,2924258,19203,3,"    Well, I appreciate that, and I agree with _x000D_
that statement. The question is, if they do it, do we have _x000D_
options? What are our options?"
2924258,2924257,2924259,19203,3,"    And I understand we do not want to show all _x000D_
our cards. I understand that we want to be able to reserve the _x000D_
rights to choose our response, based upon what China may or may _x000D_
not do. But it does seem to me that this committee is concerned _x000D_
that there are a lot of risk factors in the China seas--we have _x000D_
a lot of military obligations in the China seas and it will be _x000D_
extremely challenging to protect these alliances, and demanding _x000D_
on the United States. So it would be good to share with us in _x000D_
an appropriate setting how we can be more aggressive in our _x000D_
options to maintain stability and maritime security, and to _x000D_
make clear that provocative actions will not be ignored by us, _x000D_
because it seems to me, yes, we have had strong statements, and _x000D_
I know our actions are limited, but it seems like we are _x000D_
letting certain things go unchallenged which could lead to _x000D_
other provocative actions, which could lead to military _x000D_
conflict, which is something we all want to avoid."
2924259,2924258,2924260,19203,3,"    This is the committee of diplomacy. We will _x000D_
not give up on diplomacy. We are not the Armed Services _x000D_
Committee. We are the Foreign Relations Committee. We will not _x000D_
give up on diplomacy._x000D_
    But share with us at times in an appropriate setting what _x000D_
your strategy is in this regard, because at times we think we _x000D_
are not really showing any response to these type of _x000D_
provocative actions, other than issuing a press release. I _x000D_
think we would like to do more, and we would like to have our _x000D_
allies know that we are very much on their side when it comes _x000D_
to these provocative actions._x000D_
    The Chairman Senator Gardner."
2924260,2924259,2924261,19203,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Just to follow up on Senator Cardin's comments, in response _x000D_
to the question of has China's behavior changed or been _x000D_
influenced by our actions, we cited the oil rig moved out a _x000D_
month ahead when they said it was going to, a lack of follow-_x000D_
through with a threat on some fishing territories, and the Air _x000D_
Defense Identification Zone._x000D_
    Those seem to be the only three that we talked about. Maybe _x000D_
there are others. But I guess to follow up on Senator Cardin's _x000D_
comments, is there a lack of legislative authority that we need _x000D_
to be discussing here in terms of actions the administration _x000D_
can take through diplomacy, or other areas where we need to be _x000D_
concentrating to show results here?_x000D_
    If their activities, at least on the one island, are _x000D_
completing and 2017 or 2018, we do not have too much time to _x000D_
sit around before completion, if they are going to be serious _x000D_
about claiming that area as some kind of zone or territory._x000D_
    And the other question I had, is there political cover that _x000D_
the administration is lacking or looking for? Let us have those _x000D_
discussions in ways that we can help to make sure we are _x000D_
providing diplomatic solutions._x000D_
    Secretary Russel, you talked about the TPP. One concern I _x000D_
had after yesterday's vote--we had the failed cloture vote; _x000D_
hopefully, there are some breakthroughs today that we will move _x000D_
forward on. When we failed to proceed to what is a significant, _x000D_
I believe, opportunity to move forward on TPA, do you think _x000D_
China looks at that? Do they look at that and find I guess new _x000D_
energy, in terms of their efforts to look at the United States _x000D_
as weak or not committed to the region?"
2924261,2924260,2924262,19203,3,"    My concern, again, just continues to be _x000D_
around whether or not China is able to use the rejection of _x000D_
cloture yesterday to even advance the TPA portion, the Trade _x000D_
Promotion Authority portion, of our trade objectives moving to _x000D_
TPP, that they will use it throughout the region to say the _x000D_
United States is not serious, it is not committed, and try to _x000D_
weaken our relationships amongst the region. That continues to _x000D_
be a concern of mine._x000D_
    Would it make sense, and perhaps this is best directed to _x000D_
Secretary Shear, would it make sense to have some kind of _x000D_
international maritime operations center as some have suggested _x000D_
in the region to address concerns with territorial issues or _x000D_
claims in the South China Sea?"
2924262,2924261,2924263,19203,3,"    And I guess, Secretary Shear, just to _x000D_
follow up, if we support the efforts of some kind of _x000D_
international an operations center, what steps are we doing to _x000D_
make that happen?"
2924263,2924262,2924264,19203,3,"    But then are we doing anything on the _x000D_
international operations center itself? And if so, what?"
2924264,2924263,2924265,19203,3,"    But we have not explored that with our _x000D_
partners?"
2924265,2924264,2924266,19203,3,"    So I guess, Secretary Russel, Secretary _x000D_
Shear had said that an international operations center might be _x000D_
something that would be supported. You talked a little bit _x000D_
about the work, the cooperation between the organizations. Is _x000D_
that something we can come to on an international basis with _x000D_
states and others to actually compose one single operation _x000D_
center? Would that be helpful?"
2924266,2924265,2924267,19204,1,"    Good afternoon._x000D_
    I would like to call to order this hearing of the _x000D_
subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee._x000D_
    This afternoon, our subcommittee is holding its first _x000D_
hearing in the 114th Congress._x000D_
    So I am pleased to be chairing the subcommittee, along with _x000D_
my good friend, Senator Tom Udall, who is the subcommittee's _x000D_
ranking member. Senator Udall, I look forward to continuing to _x000D_
work with you in a very productive way as we have done in the _x000D_
past. Thank you._x000D_
    The subcommittee is meeting today to evaluate the resource, _x000D_
management, and performance of the international programs under _x000D_
our jurisdiction. I believe Congress needs to ensure that these _x000D_
programs focus on U.S. priorities, that they evaluate the _x000D_
effectiveness of all the programs, that Congress needs to _x000D_
support programs that are getting real results and eliminate _x000D_
programs that are not working._x000D_
    In preparation for a potential State Department _x000D_
reauthorization, I have asked all of our witnesses today to _x000D_
identify ways to achieve efficiencies and savings, as well as _x000D_
opportunities to more effectively advance U.S. priorities _x000D_
around the world._x000D_
    The American people I believe are very generous. _x000D_
Individuals, groups, and communities across the country give _x000D_
their time and precious resources to help others, both to _x000D_
people here and people around the world. There is a long _x000D_
history of people across this Nation generously supporting _x000D_
victims of international disasters, famines, diseases, and _x000D_
wars._x000D_
    With our national debt, however, at around $18 trillion, I _x000D_
think it is irresponsible to borrow more money to fund _x000D_
initiatives that are failing to prove results or provide real _x000D_
value for taxpayers. The Government must be a good steward of _x000D_
U.S. taxpayer dollars. Every Government branch and agency needs _x000D_
to be carefully evaluated and streamlined to eliminate _x000D_
duplicative and wasteful spending. Each program needs to be _x000D_
carefully analyzed to ensure it is being designed and _x000D_
implemented in the most effective and efficient manner. And we _x000D_
must also be focused on whether participation at multilateral _x000D_
institutions is actually advancing American values, American _x000D_
ideals, American standards._x000D_
    So there is a lot of area to cover here today, including _x000D_
the greatly needed reforms at the United Nations, promoting _x000D_
economic opportunities for U.S. businesses around the world, _x000D_
implementing real budgetary discipline at multilateral _x000D_
institutions, and eliminating duplication and wasteful _x000D_
spending. These are all important issues._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing the testimony of our witnesses, _x000D_
and we will now turn to our ranking member, Senator Udall, to _x000D_
offer his opening remarks."
2924267,2924266,2924268,19204,1,"    Thank you very much, Chairman Barrasso. And _x000D_
as you have said, we have had a good working relationship and _x000D_
look forward to doing the same on this subcommittee._x000D_
    Our subcommittee's jurisdiction covers a lot of ground, _x000D_
some would say from the ocean floor out to space. The Bureau of _x000D_
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs I _x000D_
think would agree on that. Their work, ranging from _x000D_
environmental issues such as climate change to emerging issues _x000D_
such as space is crucial to our foreign policy._x000D_
    In addition, Congress has a vital interest in international _x000D_
institutions. The United Nations and other international _x000D_
institutions impact how we interact with the world and how the _x000D_
world views the United States._x000D_
    Also, I think it is important to note that this is an area _x000D_
where we share burdens a lot, and I am going to talk a little _x000D_
bit in questions about how the GAO has looked at the idea of _x000D_
the U.N. and doing things through other countries and the _x000D_
United States doing things alone. And I think it is an _x000D_
interesting perspective there._x000D_
    So I am pleased that we have two great panels here today to _x000D_
examine ongoing efforts to strengthen the United Nations and _x000D_
also discuss U.S. support for other key issues that are before _x000D_
this panel such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, _x000D_
economic diplomacy, and the negotiations for a new climate _x000D_
change agreement that will take place in Paris this December._x000D_
    I recognize that the United Nations is a highly complex and _x000D_
decentralized organization. Potential reforms may be slow, but _x000D_
I believe it is also important to highlight the position that _x000D_
this administration has taken to engage the United Nations on _x000D_
many fronts and to elevate the status of the U.S. Permanent _x000D_
Representative to the United Nations to a Cabinet-level _x000D_
position that reports directly to the President. I know that _x000D_
the President has directed the State Department to see how we _x000D_
can evaluate and improve U.N. system transparency and _x000D_
effectiveness. I will be happy to hear more about our progress _x000D_
and challenges in those areas from Assistant Secretary Crocker._x000D_
    I am also looking forward to a discussion of the role the _x000D_
Economic Bureau plays. Chairman Barrasso mentioned that. This _x000D_
Bureau is helping businesses and workers succeed in a global _x000D_
economy. Senator Barrasso, I think, would agree there are many _x000D_
areas, particularly in energy and natural gas, where the United _x000D_
States can excel if businesses are given the opportunity to _x000D_
export overseas. In addition, I would like to know how the _x000D_
Economic Bureau is working to support normalization efforts _x000D_
with Cuba and how Congress can support these efforts further._x000D_
    And finally, I am hoping our panelists can provide us with _x000D_
an overview of ongoing international climate negotiations and _x000D_
perhaps give us a sense of the steps we need to take to make _x000D_
sure that a successful agreement is reached._x000D_
    So with that, Chairman Barrasso, I have finished with my _x000D_
opening. I turn it back to you."
2924268,2924267,2924269,19204,1,"    Well, thank you very much, Senator Udall._x000D_
    At this point, I would like to welcome all of our _x000D_
witnesses. I know you have all very busy schedules, important _x000D_
responsibilities. I appreciate you taking the time to be with _x000D_
us today._x000D_
    Joining us this afternoon on the first panel is Assistant _x000D_
Secretary of State Sheba Crocker with the Bureau of _x000D_
International Organization Affairs; also Ambassador Isobel _x000D_
Coleman, U.S. Representative to the United Nations for _x000D_
Management and Reform; Acting Assistant Secretary Judith _x000D_
Garber, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and _x000D_
Scientific Affairs; and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary _x000D_
Kurt Tong with the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs._x000D_
    Secretary Crocker, since Senator Udall mentioned you, _x000D_
perhaps we could start with you. I would say that your full _x000D_
statement will be entered into the record, and I would ask you _x000D_
to summarize it in about 5 minutes in order for members to have _x000D_
an opportunity to ask questions._x000D_
    Secretary Crocker."
2924269,2924268,2924270,19204,2,"    Well, thank you very much, Secretary _x000D_
Crocker._x000D_
    Next we will hear from Ambassador Coleman."
2924270,2924269,2924271,19204,3,"    Well, thank you very much, Ambassador _x000D_
Coleman. We appreciate your testimony._x000D_
    And we will now move to Acting Assistant Secretary Garber."
2924271,2924270,2924272,19204,4,"    Thank you very much, Secretary Garber._x000D_
    Now we will turn to Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary _x000D_
Tong. Mr. Secretary."
2924272,2924271,2924273,19204,5,"    Thank you very much, Secretary Tong._x000D_
    We will have a couple of questions, and I would like to _x000D_
start with Ambassador Coleman._x000D_
    The Office of Management and Budget has previously provided _x000D_
Congress with a list of total U.S. contributions to the United _x000D_
Nations from the State Department, as well as 18 other U.S. _x000D_
Departments and agencies. The last report from OMB explained _x000D_
that the United States contributed $7.92 billion in fiscal year _x000D_
2010. Many of us on this committee believe that the American _x000D_
people deserve to know exactly how much U.S. taxpayer money is _x000D_
going to the United Nations and how it is being spent. Do you _x000D_
know the total annual U.S. contribution to the United Nations _x000D_
from all agencies, including in-kind contributions?"
2924273,2924272,2924274,19204,5,"    Well, the reason I asked--and I did not _x000D_
expect you to give me a complete number because you are right. _x000D_
It is a complicated system. But during Ambassador Powers' _x000D_
confirmation process, I asked her if she supported Congress and _x000D_
the American people receiving an annual report from OMB of _x000D_
total U.S. contributions to the U.N., and she said yes. So the _x000D_
question is, do you support Congress and the American people _x000D_
receiving a report from OMB on the total U.S. contributions _x000D_
provided to the United Nations each year?"
2924274,2924273,2924275,19204,5,"    And then, Secretary Crocker, following up _x000D_
with Ambassador Coleman's comments, do you also agree that the _x000D_
American people deserve--and Congress--a report from OMB on the _x000D_
total U.S. contributions?"
2924275,2924274,2924276,19204,5,"    Thank you. That is very helpful._x000D_
    Ambassador Coleman, since 1994, there has been a 25-percent _x000D_
cap on the United States assessment to the U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
budget. Despite the law, the U.S. contribution has risen to _x000D_
over 28 percent for the U.N. peacekeeping budget. Fiscal year _x000D_
2016 budget request from the administration--the administration _x000D_
requested funding to meet the U.N.'s 28.36 percent assessment _x000D_
despite the fact that we have this 25-percent cap authorized by _x000D_
Congress back in the 1990s._x000D_
    Do you know why the administration has not been able to _x000D_
abide by the cap on U.N. peacekeeping?"
2924276,2924275,2924277,19204,5,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Secretary Crocker, if I could. I want to talk about _x000D_
whistleblower protections. April of this year, nine _x000D_
whistleblowers from U.N. organizations sent a letter to the _x000D_
U.N. Secretary General asserting that U.N. whistleblower _x000D_
policies failed to protect them from retaliation. And I have a _x000D_
copy of the letter that I am going to ask to be submitted for _x000D_
the record. Without objection, submitted._x000D_
_x000D_
``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at the "
2924277,2924276,2924278,19204,5,"    They wrote, put simply, the U.N. system _x000D_
of justice fails whistleblowers and most of us have been forced _x000D_
to leave the U.N. to save our livelihoods, our health, and our _x000D_
reputations. They also wrote, without proper whistleblower _x000D_
protections, wrongdoing at the United Nations, be it sexual _x000D_
exploitation, abuse of power, fraud, or corruption, will not be _x000D_
reported and will continue to go unchecked._x000D_
    Could you share with us what steps the United States is _x000D_
taking to address the failings of the United Nations and other _x000D_
multilateral institutions from protecting whistleblowers from _x000D_
the kind of retaliation that has been addressed in this letter?"
2924278,2924277,2924279,19204,5,"    Thank you so very much. My time has _x000D_
expired._x000D_
    Senator Udall."
2924279,2924278,2924280,19204,5,"    Thank you, Chairman Barrasso._x000D_
    Assistant Secretary Crocker, in addition to their ongoing _x000D_
work in Syria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic, _x000D_
the U.N. is also working to reach hundreds of thousands of _x000D_
civilians who have been displaced this year by violence in _x000D_
Iraq. Given the current strains on the U.N. humanitarian system _x000D_
caused by these crises, can you describe how the United States _x000D_
is working to support them in their work and what more can we _x000D_
do to ensure a robust global response in these emergency _x000D_
situations?"
2924280,2924279,2924281,19204,5,"    Thank you very much for that answer._x000D_
    Assistant Secretary Garber, the Department of State's QDDR _x000D_
climate change as a strategic priority for the State _x000D_
Department. And for years now, the Department of Defense has _x000D_
regarded climate change as a threat multiplier, a factor that _x000D_
will exacerbate conflict, resource scarcity, mass migration, _x000D_
and humanitarian crises, all of which can impact U.S. national _x000D_
security._x000D_
growing nexus between climate change and security, and how does _x000D_
this inform the State Department's broader diplomatic efforts? _x000D_
What do you see as the near-term security threats arising from _x000D_
climate change?"
2924281,2924280,2924282,19204,5,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Assistant Secretary Tong, how is your Bureau working to _x000D_
advance the President's efforts to normalize relations with _x000D_
Cuba? Specifically, how can your Bureau help American _x000D_
businesses start the process to engage in Cuba and with the _x000D_
Cuban people? Would you agree that increased access to telecoms _x000D_
and the Internet will be an important part of this effort to _x000D_
engage Cuba?"
2924282,2924281,2924283,19204,5,"    Thank you. My time is running out._x000D_
    But the other point that I would like, as I finish here, is _x000D_
that all of us as Senators I think have agricultural sectors in _x000D_
our States, and it is terrifically important that we try to _x000D_
open up those markets and bring down the barriers and obstacles _x000D_
that have prevented our farmers from selling their goods to the _x000D_
11 million people that are there. They are there. They eat. We _x000D_
need to open up those markets._x000D_
    Thank you, Chairman Barrasso."
2924283,2924282,2924284,19204,5,"    Thank you very much, Senator Udall._x000D_
    Senator Gardner."
2924284,2924283,2924285,19204,5,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    And thanks to the witnesses for being here today._x000D_
    Secretary Crocker, the 2016 budget--the administration _x000D_
requested $1.54 billion for the entire contributions to _x000D_
international organizations account, which a little over $1.1 _x000D_
billion would fund U.S. contributions to the United Nations and _x000D_
its affiliated agencies. Of the amount designated for U.N. _x000D_
entities, about $630 million would go to the U.S. assessed _x000D_
contribution to the U.N. regular budget._x000D_
    The U.N. General Assembly's current 2014-2015 session has _x000D_
adopted a total of 20 resolutions, singling out Israel for _x000D_
criticism, and only 3 resolutions on the rest of the world _x000D_
combined._x000D_
    Given that record, do you think Americans are getting their _x000D_
money's worth at the United Nations?"
2924285,2924284,2924286,19204,5,"    I just want to make something clear. In _x000D_
your answer, you used the word ``bias.'' Is it then your _x000D_
position that there is a bias against Israel at the United _x000D_
Nations?"
2924286,2924285,2924287,19204,5,"    Are there other areas where there is a _x000D_
bias against Israel at the United Nations?"
2924287,2924286,2924288,19204,5,"    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time."
2924288,2924287,2924289,19204,5,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Secretary Garber, I want to talk a little bit about _x000D_
international climate change negotiations. August 26 of last _x000D_
year, the New York Times had a story entitled ``Obama Pursuing _x000D_
Climate Accord in Lieu of Treaty.'' The article says the Obama _x000D_
administration is working to forge a sweeping international _x000D_
climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-_x000D_
warming fossil fuel emissions but without ratification from _x000D_
Congress._x000D_
    It also talks about the administration working on a, quote, _x000D_
``politically binding deal to cut emissions rather than a _x000D_
legally binding treaty that would require approval by two-_x000D_
thirds of the Senate.''_x000D_
    So will any agreement be legally binding on the United _x000D_
States?"
2924289,2924288,2924290,19204,5,"    So I guess the question is, does the _x000D_
administration plan to pursue a course to try to make it _x000D_
legally binding in the United States by bypassing Congress at _x000D_
the same time?"
2924290,2924289,2924291,19204,5,"    So no decision has been made about _x000D_
whether the administration plans to submit the agreement from _x000D_
Paris to the Senate for advice and consent."
2924291,2924290,2924292,19204,5,"    In March of last year, Jeff Kueter, who _x000D_
is President of the George C. Marshall Institute, released a _x000D_
recent study called ``Climate of Insecurity.'' And I ask that _x000D_
that study be entered into the record. Without objection._x000D_
_x000D_
``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at the "
2924292,2924291,2924293,19204,5,"    The report says efforts to link climate _x000D_
change to the deterioration of U.S. national security rely on _x000D_
improbable scenarios, imprecise and speculative methods, and _x000D_
scant empirical support. It goes on to say accepting the _x000D_
connection can lead to the dangerous expansion of U.S. security _x000D_
concerns, inappropriately applied resources, and diversion of _x000D_
attention from more effective responses to known environmental _x000D_
problems._x000D_
    He also provides information to show that factors other _x000D_
than the environment are much more significant in explaining _x000D_
the onset of conflict. A recent survey cited in the report _x000D_
found that the primary causes of intrastate conflict and civil _x000D_
war are political not environmental._x000D_
    So if the cause of war is political not environmental, as _x000D_
is stated in this report, then is it not possible that the _x000D_
United States could be spending millions of dollars on foreign _x000D_
climate change assistance that will not actually prevent _x000D_
instability?"
2924293,2924292,2924294,19204,5,"    So stressors could also be expensive _x000D_
energy, and sometimes the focus I see of the administration on _x000D_
clean energy as opposed to affordable energy--and if you talk _x000D_
to Bill Gates and say what is important--and so much of the _x000D_
work that he has done in other countries has been aimed at _x000D_
affordable energy--he said that a country grows when energy for _x000D_
transportation fuel and for electricity are affordable. It _x000D_
would just seem to me that sacrificing affordability for the _x000D_
focus of the administration, the fixation if you will, on clean _x000D_
energy could be an unnecessary stressor. And perhaps the _x000D_
administration is focused on the wrong stressors in terms of _x000D_
global instability."
2924294,2924293,2924295,19204,5,"    Obviously, this is a tight budget _x000D_
environment. We have this huge debt. There are many competing _x000D_
priorities across the globe. The President's budget request _x000D_
includes $1.29 billion for the Global Climate Change _x000D_
Initiative. This is a 55-percent increase in funding from _x000D_
fiscal year 2014._x000D_
    So for fiscal year 2016, the Bureau has requested an _x000D_
increase of another $330 million in economic support funds to _x000D_
go toward a brand new green climate fund._x000D_
    Given the increasing need for humanitarian assistance, _x000D_
democracy promotion, embassy security measures, countering _x000D_
global terrorist threats, I am wondering why the administration _x000D_
is requesting such a large increase for global climate change _x000D_
where I think most people would think this could be better _x000D_
spent on the issues of humanitarian assistance, democracy _x000D_
protection, embassy security, and countering global terrorist _x000D_
threats."
2924295,2924294,2924296,19204,5,"    Senator Udall, do you have additional _x000D_
questions?"
2924296,2924295,2924297,19204,5,"    Yes, thank you, Chairman Barrasso._x000D_
    I asked one question on climate change and I want to come _x000D_
back to that. It seems to me that this problem is only going to _x000D_
be solved if all of the countries in the world are working _x000D_
together. That is the first point. And so the fact that we are _x000D_
going to Paris and trying to work with countries around the _x000D_
world I think is very important because if we just sit here _x000D_
isolated, we are not going to be able to do that. And so I urge _x000D_
you to try to work with all the other countries around the _x000D_
world and work, as President Obama has, with China where both _x000D_
countries, the two biggest emitters, set specific targets of _x000D_
where they are going._x000D_
    And my understanding is that as a result of that discussion _x000D_
and the targets that are out there and how we are trying to _x000D_
move, we are seeing a dramatic change in attitude in terms of _x000D_
countries around the world going into Paris. Has that happened? _x000D_
Do you sense that, Assistant Secretary Garber, from the work _x000D_
that you are seeing being done on the ground?"
2924297,2924296,2924298,19204,5,"    And when it comes to doing the things like--_x000D_
you mentioned the two of three areas you are focusing on, clean _x000D_
energy, sustainable landscapes. Is it not in our national _x000D_
interest to decrease foreign pollution, especially pollution _x000D_
that is impacting Americans negatively right now? It seems to _x000D_
me we are not just working on the international basis. We are _x000D_
trying to do things that will change the situation here at _x000D_
home. As we know, many of the measurements on our coasts _x000D_
where--Los Angeles--they can look at where the pollution comes _x000D_
from--my understanding about a third of that pollution is _x000D_
coming from across the seas. And so we are all interconnected _x000D_
in this. We just need to make sure that we are all working _x000D_
together to try to be a part of the solution._x000D_
    And the question I guess is on that impact here in America."
2924298,2924297,2924299,19204,5,"    Ambassador Crocker, I want to come back to _x000D_
the question about Israel because I think it drives home a _x000D_
point in terms of our engagement with the U.N. You mentioned _x000D_
that before the Human Rights Council, there was another _x000D_
commission. We were not involved at all. But as you know, _x000D_
recently we have been very involved in this Human Rights _x000D_
Council. And as you have testified, there has been less focus _x000D_
in terms of being anti-Israel, and to me that highlights the _x000D_
point that if we get engaged, then other countries are willing _x000D_
to see us working through the process at the U.N. and allowing _x000D_
us then to move forward._x000D_
    Would you agree with that? And are there other examples of _x000D_
where direct engagement, whether it is reform area or other _x000D_
areas? Ambassador Coleman, you may want to comment on this _x000D_
also."
2924299,2924298,2924300,19204,5,"    Ambassador Coleman, just 30 seconds or so."
2924300,2924299,2924301,19204,5,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Chairman Barrasso."
2924301,2924300,2924302,19204,5,"    Thank you, Senator Udall._x000D_
    Senator Markey."
2924302,2924301,2924303,19204,5,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Secretary Garber, you have a significant responsibility for _x000D_
carrying out a range of tasks. The White House, February 2015, _x000D_
issued the implementation plan for the national strategy for _x000D_
combating wildlife trafficking. Could you discuss your efforts, _x000D_
how they address the international conservation goals and _x000D_
anticipated challenges that oceans, environment, and science _x000D_
may face in responding to the national call to combat wildlife _x000D_
trafficking?"
2924303,2924302,2924304,19204,5,"    Talk a little bit about deforestation. Talk _x000D_
about the Amazon. Talk about what we can do to help to create _x000D_
sustainable landscape programs. How would that affect _x000D_
deforestation work?"
2924304,2924303,2924305,19204,5,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Secretary Garber, I know that our climate negotiations are _x000D_
in great hands. I know Todd Stern is doing a great job. You are _x000D_
doing a great job. Secretary Kerry is doing a great job. I love _x000D_
the progress that we have made with China and with other _x000D_
countries beginning to step up to the plate to play their role _x000D_
in making sure that every country is making a commitment. And I _x000D_
am very optimistic about what can happen, what we can unleash _x000D_
as a future._x000D_
    I just actually left a meeting with 10 MIT scientists who _x000D_
are very bullish on solar and the role that it can play in the _x000D_
years ahead in dealing with this issue. We just have to put the _x000D_
right incentives on the books, and then we can just watch this _x000D_
whole area explode._x000D_
    So I think it is in good hands. So I feel good about _x000D_
climate and the negotiations._x000D_
    So I am going to move on to something else that I am _x000D_
concerned about which is seafood fraud and illegal fishing, _x000D_
which is bad for everyone from fishermen to seafood lovers, and _x000D_
it threatens the health of the ocean and the bottom lines of _x000D_
fishermen in Massachusetts and all of America's coasts. And I _x000D_
was glad to work with my colleagues on this committee last year _x000D_
to move the Port State Agreement that will help combat illegal _x000D_
fishing and the economic and environmental harm it causes. And _x000D_
I look forward to working with the Commerce Committee to move _x000D_
additional legislation to combat illegal fishing in this _x000D_
Congress._x000D_
    But I am happy that through Secretary Kerry's leadership on _x000D_
ocean issues, the State Department is already making strides to _x000D_
level the playing field for our domestic fishing industry, _x000D_
which operates under some of the toughest conservation _x000D_
requirements in the world._x000D_
    I know the final recommendations, Ms. Garber, of the _x000D_
Presidential task force on combating illegal, unreported, and _x000D_
unregulated fishing and seafood fraud were just released in _x000D_
March. But could you tell us where you have seen positive _x000D_
results already or are anticipating seeing those results in the _x000D_
future?"
2924305,2924304,2924306,19204,5,"    That is great because if you are a _x000D_
fisherman in Gloucester or New Bedford, you got big problems if _x000D_
we do not begin to crack down on illegal fishing. It is just _x000D_
absolutely going to be devastating to us. And so I am glad that _x000D_
you are leading that effort. I think it is absolutely _x000D_
critically important._x000D_
    And we have to do something again in your portfolio on _x000D_
climate change. There were readings in the ocean off of _x000D_
Massachusetts in January, 21 degrees warmer than normal in _x000D_
January off of the ocean in Massachusetts. So the cod need cold _x000D_
water. The lobster need cold water. So it is having a _x000D_
fundamental impact on huge industries. And, in fact, that cold _x000D_
air coming down from the Arctic kept hitting this very warm _x000D_
ocean, and to a large extent, that is what gave us 111 inches _x000D_
of snow, that incredible impact that cold weather has when it _x000D_
hits warm water. And I know that you are working on that. And I _x000D_
appreciate your being here._x000D_
    My colleagues from Wyoming and New Mexico are not as close _x000D_
to the ocean as I am sure they would like to be. [Laughter.]"
2924306,2924305,2924307,19204,5,"    So these issues are central to us. But Mark _x000D_
Twain used to say that an expert is anyone who lives further _x000D_
than 500 miles from the problem. So we got people here to help _x000D_
us to solve those issues._x000D_
    So thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much for your indulgence."
2924307,2924306,2924308,19204,5,"    Thank you. Thank you very much._x000D_
    I appreciate all of you being here today. Thank you for _x000D_
your service to our Nation and for working to advance the _x000D_
American interests all across the globe._x000D_
    At this time, we will take a minute to transition to the _x000D_
second panel. I would ask that second panel of witnesses to _x000D_
move to the table._x000D_
    I want to welcome our second panel of distinguished _x000D_
witnesses to the committee. I appreciate your efforts to be _x000D_
with us today to provide valuable insights. I appreciate your _x000D_
patience by sitting attentively through the first panel. _x000D_
Joining us on the second panel is Mr. Brett Schaefer, the Jay _x000D_
Kingham Senior Research Fellow in International Regulatory _x000D_
Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. Thank you very much for _x000D_
joining us. And also Mr. Reid Detchon, the Vice President for _x000D_
Energy and Climate Strategy at the United Nations Foundation._x000D_
    As I noted earlier, your full statements will be included _x000D_
in the record in their entirety, hearing no objection to that. _x000D_
I do ask that you try to summarize your statements in about 5 _x000D_
minutes._x000D_
    Mr. Schaefer."
2924308,2924307,2924309,19204,6,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Mr. Detchon."
2924309,2924308,2924310,19204,7,"    Well, thank you very much for your _x000D_
thoughtful testimony today._x000D_
    I would like to start with the questioning. Mr. Schaefer, _x000D_
with regard to the U.N. budget, I appreciate you providing this _x000D_
subcommittee with several concrete proposals for responsible _x000D_
reforms at the United Nations. The United States is the largest _x000D_
financial contributor to the U.N., and I am concerned that the _x000D_
financial burden at the United Nations is not shared equally or _x000D_
in accordance with current economic realities._x000D_
    So could you explain why the United States is paying more _x000D_
to the U.N. budget than all of the other permanent members of _x000D_
the U.N. Security Council combined?"
2924310,2924309,2924311,19204,7,"    So what actions could Congress take to _x000D_
limit the growth in the U.N. budget and ensure a more equitable _x000D_
distribution of the costs as you just outlined?"
2924311,2924310,2924312,19204,7,"    Because it does seem the administration's _x000D_
request for funding to meet the 2016 budget for the U.N., is _x000D_
again higher than the 25 percent. I think the request this time _x000D_
was at 28.36 percent. So without any changes, you do expect the _x000D_
amount owed by the United States at the U.N. to continue to _x000D_
increase."
2924312,2924311,2924313,19204,7,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Detchon, on November 3 of this past year, you wrote a _x000D_
column entitled ``Climate Action Means a Brighter Future.'' In _x000D_
the column you said there is good reason for us to act not only _x000D_
because of the dangers, you said, of disruptive climate change. _x000D_
You said, but because of a new climate economy, it will be _x000D_
better for business. You go on to say it will improve our _x000D_
health, prosperity, and security, as well as our environment._x000D_
    I would like to highlight a letter from Wyoming Governor _x000D_
Matt Mead to the EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, about--this _x000D_
was a letter last week. And I am going to submit the Governor's _x000D_
letter to the record._x000D_
_x000D_
``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at the "
2924313,2924312,2924314,19204,7,"    In his letter, he highlights a recent _x000D_
study by the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at _x000D_
the University of Wyoming, and the study is called The Impact _x000D_
of the Coal Economy on Wyoming.'' It was published this year in _x000D_
February. And I am going to put that study in the record too._x000D_
_x000D_
voluminous to include in the printed hearing. It will be "
2924314,2924313,2924315,19204,7,"    The study says overall proposed carbon _x000D_
regulations result in a predicted declined in the State's _x000D_
combined coal and natural gas revenues of between 36 and 46 _x000D_
percent by the year 2030. It says Wyoming can expect to lose _x000D_
7,000 jobs._x000D_
    So my State is finding that the President's clean power _x000D_
plant, as part of his international climate change commitment, _x000D_
is going to cost thousands of good paying jobs, dramatically _x000D_
slash State revenue that pays for college scholarships, _x000D_
schools, medical emergency services, road safety programs, _x000D_
environmental protection programs, water quality services, _x000D_
veterans services, vital State services._x000D_
    So as a doctor, I attest that unemployment caused by any _x000D_
plan will lead to serious health impacts for unemployed _x000D_
husbands and mothers, as well as children of the unemployed. I _x000D_
have actually written a report called ``Red Tape: Making _x000D_
Americans Sick.'' I am going to put that in the record._x000D_
_x000D_
to include in the printed hearing. It will be retained in the "
2924315,2924314,2924316,19204,7,"    It talks about the high impacts of _x000D_
individuals of long-term unemployment._x000D_
    So given all this information, is the deal the President is _x000D_
trying to commit America to in Paris through the United _x000D_
Nations, without approval from Congress, it seems--is this _x000D_
going to improve Wyoming's health, prosperity, and security, as _x000D_
well as our environment, as your column suggests?"
2924316,2924315,2924317,19204,7,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Senator Udall."
2924317,2924316,2924318,19204,7,"    Thank you, Chairman Barrasso._x000D_
    And one of the things, Mr. Detchon, you seem to be hitting _x000D_
on is that there are opportunities for our businesses also with _x000D_
regard to, say, the Sustainability for All initiative. Do you _x000D_
believe there are opportunities for U.S. businesses to engage _x000D_
with developing countries as they work to improve access to _x000D_
renewable energy and improve energy efficiency? How can the _x000D_
State Department work with these businesses to ensure that they _x000D_
have access to these emerging markets? And do you do that too _x000D_
at the U.N. Foundation?"
2924318,2924317,2924319,19204,7,"    And you would expect that with aggressive _x000D_
action by U.S. companies, that they will get a part of those _x000D_
markets in terms of creating jobs and growing jobs here and _x000D_
probably growing jobs other places in the world."
2924319,2924318,2924320,19204,7,"    Now, one of the things you mentioned in your _x000D_
testimony here was that it was the marketplace and the pricing _x000D_
that was driving utility companies to go to natural gas rather _x000D_
than coal. And really, what you have is, as Senator Barrasso _x000D_
and I both know, additional production of natural gas. You _x000D_
really, in a way, have a glut on the market. It has driven down _x000D_
the price. And so these utility companies looking at the _x000D_
situation and with natural gas being cheaper--they would much _x000D_
rather be burning natural gas than be burning coal. And so that _x000D_
is really the big transformation we are seeing take place, _x000D_
rather than this being the administration putting regulations _x000D_
in place. Is it not?"
2924320,2924319,2924321,19204,7,"    Now, it has been mentioned several times _x000D_
with our previous panel and then with this panel about the _x000D_
total U.N. budget being about $44 billion. This amounts roughly _x000D_
to the same overall budget as Angola. In return, the U.N. _x000D_
manages 16 peacekeeping missions with over 130,000 troops--that _x000D_
is the largest deployed military in the world--11 political _x000D_
missions, including ones in Iraq and Afghanistan; the largest _x000D_
humanitarian organization in the world, the World Food _x000D_
Programme plus vital organizations like UNICEF and WHO, who _x000D_
help the U.N. vaccinate 60 percent of the world's children. If _x000D_
they were not doing that, those children were not vaccinated, _x000D_
we would have some big problems out there. Plus, there are _x000D_
dozens of specialized agencies which work closely with American _x000D_
businesses on issues like shipping, civil aviation, and of _x000D_
course, the U.N. offers a forum for all countries to gather and _x000D_
discuss the critical issues of the day._x000D_
    I think if you put those kinds of things that the U.N. is _x000D_
doing every day, put that in light, many would say the overall _x000D_
budget does not seem out of proportion. And I am wondering, Mr. _x000D_
Detchon, you looking at it from--it sounds like you specialize _x000D_
in energy and in climate. Would you agree with that in terms of _x000D_
some of the things that are out there? And what are the _x000D_
examples you would bring to the table in terms of energy and _x000D_
climate change?"
2924321,2924320,2924322,19204,7,    Thank you.
2924322,2924321,2924323,19204,7,"    Thank you, Senator Udall._x000D_
    Mr. Schaefer, I want to just follow up on this line of _x000D_
questioning regarding the U.N. peacekeepers because currently _x000D_
the United States is paying about $2.4 billion in taxpayer _x000D_
funds to U.N. peacekeeping budgets, and we have just heard the _x000D_
number of personnel that may be representing different _x000D_
countries and the issues of oversight and accountability, _x000D_
responsibility, because there have been numerous reports _x000D_
describing the sexual exploitation and abuse by the U.N. _x000D_
peacekeepers and civilian personnel participating in these U.N. _x000D_
peacekeeping missions. And I think we would all agree this is a _x000D_
very serious problem._x000D_
    So despite years of focus on this issue and the United _x000D_
States contributing such a percentage with 28 percent to the _x000D_
U.N. peacekeeping budget, really we seem to be unable to stop _x000D_
the criminal conduct of these troops. So what steps can we take _x000D_
to address the abuse and the misconduct of U.N. peacekeepers, _x000D_
as well as preventing it from happening in the future?"
2924323,2924322,2924324,19204,7,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Udall."
2924324,2924323,2924325,19204,7,"    Thank you, Chairman Barrasso._x000D_
    On this issue of peacekeeping, I think it is important that _x000D_
we keep in mind what we are getting there. And the current _x000D_
peacekeeping budget is around $8.5 billion, and it sounds like _x000D_
a big number and is a big number. That $8.5 billion funds the _x000D_
lifesaving work of more than 130,000 uniformed personnel _x000D_
spanning 16 missions around the world. But to put it in _x000D_
context, that is less than the city of Chicago's annual budget. _x000D_
In some of these cases, if the U.N. was not there, it would _x000D_
cost the United States much more._x000D_
    And I am citing here a GAO study that has looked at this _x000D_
and found U.N. missions were eight times cheaper than U.S. _x000D_
forces acting alone. For a U.N. mission, the cost per _x000D_
peacekeeper per year is about $15,000. In 2014, each U.S. _x000D_
soldier in Afghanistan cost $2.1 million._x000D_
    Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint _x000D_
Chiefs of Staff, observed that U.N. peacekeepers ``help reduce _x000D_
the risks that major U.S. military interventions may be _x000D_
required to restore stability in a country or a region.'' So I _x000D_
think you have some of our major military people weighing in _x000D_
and saying this is important work. We need to be out there _x000D_
doing this with the U.N. Obviously, we have many _x000D_
responsibilities to do with our military also._x000D_
    Mr. Detchon, do you have any comment on that?"
2924325,2924324,2924326,19204,7,"    And obviously, as Chairman Barrasso has made _x000D_
the point--and you have just made it too--misbehavior should _x000D_
not be tolerated. Also, we should not have situations like in _x000D_
Haiti where U.N. troops go in and apparently are the cause--it _x000D_
has been pretty well documented--of the cholera and the _x000D_
spreading of cholera. And there has been no real accountability _x000D_
there. So I mean, the U.N. needs to be just as accountable as _x000D_
other governments and organizations around the world. No doubt _x000D_
about that._x000D_
    Just a final question because you mentioned, Mr. Detchon, _x000D_
about the IPCC conclusions on climate change. And I think one _x000D_
of the things that is important to emphasize--you talked about _x000D_
190 countries agreeing. The important point there is that these _x000D_
countries are working together on the IPCC, but they have _x000D_
scientists in their own countries that are reviewing what is _x000D_
said by other scientists and they are only signing on if their _x000D_
scientists look at the science and say this is looking pretty _x000D_
solid and we believe in these conclusions. And it is pretty _x000D_
remarkable when you think of all the disagreements we have _x000D_
around the world, that 190 countries would agree with the _x000D_
conclusions and where we are. Do you have any comment on that?"
2924326,2924325,2924327,19204,7,    About the IPCC and the scientists.
2924327,2924326,2924328,19204,7,"    Chairman Barrasso, thank you. A very _x000D_
productive hearing I thought."
2924328,2924327,2924329,19204,7,"    Thank you very much, Senator Udall, for _x000D_
your thorough preparation and questioning._x000D_
    I appreciate all the witnesses for making the time to be _x000D_
here today. I will thank each of you for sharing your thoughts _x000D_
and insights with our subcommittee._x000D_
    We are going to leave the record open until the close of _x000D_
business on Monday, May 11, for any members of this committee _x000D_
who are not able to attend. They may have written questions for _x000D_
either our first or second panel. And since our committee will _x000D_
be considering a potential State Department reauthorization _x000D_
bill, I ask that you quickly respond to any written questions _x000D_
from the members of the committee. Thank you very much._x000D_
    And the hearing is adjourned."
2924329,2924328,2924330,19212,1,"    The Senate Committee on Health, Education, _x000D_
Labor, and Pensions will please come to order._x000D_
    This morning, we're holding a hearing about the reemergence _x000D_
of vaccine-preventable diseases. Senator Murray and I will each _x000D_
have an opening statement. Then we'll introduce our panel of _x000D_
witnesses. After our witness testimony, Senators will each have _x000D_
5 minutes of questions._x000D_
    We have two panels today and 2 hours for the hearing. We're _x000D_
going to end about noon. We'll have an hour for each panel, and _x000D_
I will end the first panel at 11 o'clock._x000D_
    From smallpox to polio, we have learned in the United _x000D_
States that vaccines save lives. Yet a troubling number of _x000D_
parents are not vaccinating their children. Last September, _x000D_
this committee held a hearing about the Ebola virus. Our _x000D_
witnesses included a brave physician, Dr. Kent Brantly, who _x000D_
worked in Liberia and who contracted Ebola, and a brave father _x000D_
in Sierra Leone who came to warn us about how rapidly the virus _x000D_
was spreading there._x000D_
    The number of people being infected with Ebola was doubling _x000D_
every 3 weeks, and many of those infected were dying, because _x000D_
for Ebola there was and is no cure, and there was and is no _x000D_
vaccine. This produced a near panic in the United States. It _x000D_
changed procedures in nearly every hospital and clinic. I _x000D_
remember one Chattanooga public health officer saying it's all _x000D_
Ebola all the time every day._x000D_
    In response, Congress appropriated more than $5 billion to _x000D_
fight the spread of the virus. The impact of efforts to fight _x000D_
Ebola is that the number of Ebola cases is declining. At the _x000D_
same time, here in the United States we are now experiencing a _x000D_
large outbreak of a disease for which we do have a vaccine._x000D_
    Measles used to sicken up to 4 million Americans each year. _x000D_
Many believed that it was an unpreventable childhood illness. _x000D_
But the introduction of a vaccine in 1963 changed everything. _x000D_
Measles was declared eliminated, meaning absence of continuous _x000D_
disease transmission for greater than 12 months from the United _x000D_
States in 2000._x000D_
    Then from 2001 to 2012, the median yearly number of measles _x000D_
cases reported in all of our country was 60. Today is February _x000D_
10, 2015. It is the 41st day of the year, and already we have _x000D_
seen more cases of measles than we would in a typical year._x000D_
    One measles outbreak in Palatine, IL, a suburb about a half _x000D_
hour from Chicago, has affected at least five babies, all less _x000D_
than 1 year old. Infants and individuals who are _x000D_
immunocompromised are traditionally protected by what is called _x000D_
herd immunity, meaning when more than 9 out of 10 of the people _x000D_
around them are vaccinated, so they don't get sick, and that _x000D_
keeps the babies and others who can't get vaccinated from _x000D_
getting sick. That herd immunity is incredibly important. _x000D_
Measles can cause life threatening complications in children, _x000D_
such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain._x000D_
    Our witnesses today will talk more not just about what is _x000D_
causing this outbreak, but why some parents are choosing not to _x000D_
vaccinate their children. Measles is only one example. This _x000D_
hearing, which was planned before the measles outbreak, reminds _x000D_
us of the importance of vaccines._x000D_
    An analysis of immunization rates across 13 States _x000D_
performed by USA Today found the following: Hundreds of _x000D_
thousands of students attend schools, ranging from small _x000D_
private academies in New York City to large public elementary _x000D_
schools outside Boston to Native American reservation schools _x000D_
in Idaho, where vaccination rates have dropped precipitously _x000D_
low, sometimes under 50 percent._x000D_
    California is 1 of the 20 States that allow parents to _x000D_
claim personal belief exemptions from vaccination requirements. _x000D_
In some areas of Los Angeles, 60 percent to 70 percent of _x000D_
parents at certain schools have filed a personal belief _x000D_
exemption. In those elementary schools, vaccination rates are _x000D_
as low as those in Chad or in South Sudan._x000D_
    The purpose of this hearing is to examine what is standing _x000D_
between healthy children and deadly diseases. It ought to be _x000D_
vaccinations. Too many parents are turning away from sound _x000D_
science. Sound science is this: Vaccines save lives._x000D_
    They save the lives of the people who are vaccinated. They _x000D_
protect the lives of the vulnerable around them, like infants _x000D_
and those who are ill. Vaccines save lives._x000D_
    They protect us from the ravages of awful diseases like _x000D_
polio, which invades the nervous system and can cause _x000D_
paralysis. I can remember as a child how parents were _x000D_
frightened by the prospect of polio for their child. I had _x000D_
classmates who lived in iron lungs. Our majority leader, _x000D_
Senator McConnell, contracted polio as a child._x000D_
    Whooping cough is another example, which causes thick mucus _x000D_
to accumulate in the airways and can make it difficult for _x000D_
babies to breathe; or diphtheria, a bacterial infection that _x000D_
affects the mucous membranes of your nose and throat and can, _x000D_
in advanced stages, damage your heart, kidneys, and nervous _x000D_
system._x000D_
    We have learned that vaccines save lives. They take deadly, _x000D_
awful, ravaging diseases from horror to history._x000D_
    It is troubling to hear that before we've even reached _x000D_
Valentine's Day this year, 121 Americans are sick with measles, _x000D_
a disease eliminated in the United States 15 years ago. It is _x000D_
troubling that a growing number of parents are not following _x000D_
the recommendations of doctors and public health professionals _x000D_
who have been making those recommendations for decades._x000D_
    At a time when we are standing on the cusp of medical _x000D_
breakthroughs never imagined--cutting-edge personalized _x000D_
medicine tailored to an individual's genome, for example--we _x000D_
find ourselves retreading old ground._x000D_
    I now turn to Senator Murray for her opening statement._x000D_
_x000D_
                  Opening Statement of Senator Murray"
2924330,2924329,2924331,19212,1,"    Thank you, Senator Murray, and thank you to _x000D_
you and your staff for working with us to jointly invite the _x000D_
witnesses today. That always produces a better hearing and a _x000D_
good variety of views._x000D_
    Each witness will have up to 5 minutes._x000D_
    We'll ask you, Dr. Schuchat, if you'll summarize your views _x000D_
in 5 minutes so Senators can have a chance to ask questions._x000D_
    Then we'll take an hour. I said before some of the Senators _x000D_
came in that we'll have to end the first panel at 11 so we can _x000D_
get to the second panel, which will go on to 12. I hope all of _x000D_
us can get questions in to the first panel. If not, you'll be _x000D_
first in line on the second panel._x000D_

Senator Frist, our Senate majority leader, who was also a _x000D_
physician, led a group of us to South Africa, where we found _x000D_
the president of South Africa had rejected the science on HIV/_x000D_
AIDS. He decided it wasn't caused by a virus, and that the cure _x000D_
was the elimination of poverty, setting back South Africa for _x000D_
years in terms of its ability to deal with HIV/AIDS._x000D_
    Now, today, there's information that's on the internet, _x000D_
which is where we were told the South African president had _x000D_
found his information some years ago, that says there was a _x000D_
study published in The Lancet in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield _x000D_
alleging a connection between the measles, mumps, and rubella _x000D_
vaccine, MMR, and autism._x000D_
    Let's say you're a physician or pediatrician, and a parent _x000D_
comes in and says, ``I've been on the internet, and I'm _x000D_
concerned, because I found that according to this medical _x000D_
journal, there is a relationship between the measles and mumps _x000D_
vaccine and autism.'' What would you say to that parent?"
2924332,2924331,2924333,19212,2,"    When you say totally discredited, what do you _x000D_
mean by that?"
2924333,2924332,2924334,19212,2,"    You would say to the parent that that article _x000D_
was just flat wrong."
2924334,2924333,2924335,19212,2,"    And that numerous studies have shown that it _x000D_
was wrong."
2924335,2924334,2924336,19212,2,    What happened to the author of the article?
2924336,2924335,2924337,19212,2,    Why?
2924337,2924336,2924338,19212,2,"    Because of the fraudulent behavior. We've _x000D_
been talking about a variety of vaccines. It struck me, as we _x000D_
were so worried about Ebola last fall--and we're still worried _x000D_
about it--that many of the public health people from Tennessee _x000D_
would point out to me that we had the flu season coming up. How _x000D_
many Americans die each year from the flu?"
2924338,2924337,2924339,19212,2,"    Three-thousand to fifty-thousand could die _x000D_
from flu. Is there a vaccine for flu?"
2924339,2924338,2924340,19212,2,"    Let's go back to measles for a minute. _x000D_
Measles is not just a runny nose, is it? It is a serious _x000D_
disease. What would you say to a parent who comes in and says, _x000D_
``I'm going to opt not to get the measles vaccine?'' What are _x000D_
the risks of that? How many children who contract measles die?"
2924340,2924339,2924341,19212,2,"    Would it be accurate to say that if your _x000D_
child contracted measles in the United States, the chances of a _x000D_
death would be about 1 in 1,000?"
2924341,2924340,2924342,19212,2,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Murray."
2924342,2924341,2924343,19212,2,"    Thanks, Senator Murray._x000D_
    We'll now move to 5-minute rounds of questions. Senator _x000D_
Collins, Senator Mikulski, Senator Cassidy, Senator Warren will _x000D_
be the first four. For the Senators who just arrived, at 11, _x000D_
we're going to move to the second panel even if we haven't _x000D_
finished the Senators' questions. That will take 15 minutes, _x000D_
and then we'll pick right up where we left off with the _x000D_
Senators who are next in line._x000D_
    Senator Collins._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Collins"
2924343,2924342,2924344,19212,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Dr. Schuchat, the president's budget request includes a $50 _x000D_
million cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention _x000D_
Section 317 immunization program. You just responded to a _x000D_
question from Senator Murray about the importance of the State _x000D_
and local public health infrastructure._x000D_
    More than just paying for vaccines, the section 317 _x000D_
immunization program supports outreach, awareness, surveillance _x000D_
efforts by the State and local public health agencies. It's _x000D_
puzzling to me that the administration would propose to cut _x000D_
this program when we're in the midst of a measles outbreak, _x000D_
when you would think that you would want increased public _x000D_
outreach, awareness, and surveillance._x000D_
    You've just talked about the importance of the State and _x000D_
local roles. Could you explain to us why this cut has been _x000D_
proposed?"
2924344,2924343,2924345,19212,2,"    Well, it just seems to me that this is _x000D_
exactly the wrong time for us to be reducing funding in this _x000D_
area, given the importance that you've just outlined._x000D_
    Historically, access to healthcare and the cost of vaccines _x000D_
had been the major barriers to achieving high vaccination _x000D_
rates. Increasingly, it's clear that other factors have come to _x000D_
bear as we're seeing declining vaccination rates in some _x000D_
extremely wealthy areas of our country. For example, there was _x000D_
a recent article in The Atlantic magazine that recently _x000D_
compared unfavorably the vaccination rates in wealthy areas of _x000D_
Los Angeles to the higher rates in the South Sudan._x000D_
    How should our public health strategy change to reach those _x000D_
parents? You would not think that that would be the area, since _x000D_
they obviously can afford the cost of the vaccines and have _x000D_
ample access to healthcare, certainly better than those in the _x000D_
South Sudan."
2924345,2924344,2924346,19212,2,"    Thank you. I think that The Lancet study _x000D_
also played a huge role. Unfortunately, there are a lot of _x000D_
people who still mistakenly believe there is a link to autism _x000D_
and are unaware that that study has been thoroughly _x000D_
discredited._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924346,2924345,2924347,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Collins._x000D_
    Senator Mikulski._x000D_
_x000D_
                     Statement of Senator Mikulski"
2924347,2924346,2924348,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Mikulski._x000D_
    Senator Cassidy._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Cassidy"
2924348,2924347,2924349,19212,2,    We need to keep moving.
2924349,2924348,2924350,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Cassidy._x000D_
    Senator Warren._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Warren"
2924350,2924349,2924351,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Warren._x000D_
    Senator Roberts._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Roberts"
2924351,2924350,2924352,19212,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you _x000D_
holding this hearing._x000D_
    In Kansas, we had 19 cases of vaccine-preventable diseases _x000D_
last year. The most prevalent was measles. We have not had any _x000D_
new measles cases reported yet this year. However, our public _x000D_
health workers are concerned, our parents are concerned, and I _x000D_
am concerned. The problem is that our immunization rates are _x000D_
down. For the 2013 year to the 2014 school year, the percentage _x000D_
of youngsters that have received the necessary vaccinations is _x000D_
now below 90. That's not good._x000D_
    For the record, I had measles and chicken pox and mumps and _x000D_
everything else that people had back in the day._x000D_
    What I'm asking, if I can get to it here very quickly--if _x000D_
immunization rates continue to decline, what advice do you give _x000D_
to these youngsters' parents who have to rely on others in _x000D_
their community to choose vaccination to help protect their _x000D_
own?"
2924352,2924351,2924353,19212,2,"    Well, you highlight three reasons parents _x000D_
don't vaccinate--the fear of side effects, religious or _x000D_
philosophical objections--and there's a whole bunch of _x000D_
paragraphs here in the background information on which States _x000D_
are easier to get a religious exemption and which are easier to _x000D_
get a philosophical objection--a simple letter signed by a _x000D_
doctor._x000D_
    How often, however, about the mistrust of the recommended _x000D_
vaccine schedule--how often would you say that is the reason _x000D_
that the vaccine schedule is too rigorous, and what _x000D_
reassurances could you provide to parents on this concern?"
2924353,2924352,2924354,19212,2,"    In answer to the chairman's question, _x000D_
which really nailed the issue right off the bat, there was a _x000D_
major Danish study published in 2002--540,000 children showed _x000D_
definitely there was no relationship between MMR, i.e., measles _x000D_
vaccination, and any kind of problem with autism. An Institute _x000D_
of Medicine report in 2004 did the same._x000D_
    Along the way, there have been studies from the National _x000D_
Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and _x000D_
hundreds of other reliable academic groups. All of these _x000D_
examinations point to the same conclusion. The body of evidence _x000D_
was firmly established a long time ago._x000D_
    However, this is a State issue, and that seems to be the _x000D_
problem. CDC is doing the very best that you can to try to _x000D_
convince every State--Mississippi leads. We're at the bottom--_x000D_
not at the bottom, but fairly close to it. I'm very concerned _x000D_
about it. At least the media today realizes that the one study _x000D_
which was totally discredited--that there should be a very _x000D_
strong statement by everybody involved that they should go _x000D_
ahead and get these vaccinations._x000D_
    I strongly recommend that, and I thank you for your _x000D_
leadership."
2924354,2924353,2924355,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Roberts._x000D_
    We'll now go to Senator Baldwin. I want to mention again to _x000D_
the Senators that at 11 we're going to excuse Dr. Schuchat and _x000D_
call the second panel for 15 minutes. Then any Senator who _x000D_
hasn't had a chance to ask a question will be the first one up._x000D_
    Senator Baldwin._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Baldwin"
2924355,2924354,2924356,19212,2,"    Dr. Schuchat, I'd like to try to get Senator _x000D_
Franken in before you leave, if we may."
2924356,2924355,2924357,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Baldwin._x000D_
    Senator Franken._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Franken"
2924357,2924356,2924358,19212,2,"    Thank you, Senator Franken._x000D_
    Dr. Schuchat, maybe I misheard something. The State _x000D_
Department website says that U.S. immigration law requires _x000D_
immigrant visa applicants to obtain certain vaccinations prior _x000D_
to the issuance of an immigrant visa. An adult immigrant to the _x000D_
United States who obtains a visa is required to obtain certain _x000D_
vaccinations, correct?"
2924358,2924357,2924359,19212,2,"    I'm reading it off of the State Department _x000D_
website."
2924359,2924358,2924360,19212,2,"    I didn't want to leave a different impression _x000D_
if a different impression was untrue."
2924360,2924359,2924361,19212,2,"    Dr. Schuchat, thank you so much for your _x000D_
time. There are a couple of Senators who haven't had a chance _x000D_
to ask questions. I hope they will understand that we want to _x000D_
invite the second panel to come up now, and they will be the _x000D_
first ones up after the next 15 minutes of testimony._x000D_
    I'll now move ahead and introduce the second panel to save _x000D_
time, if I may. First, we'll hear from Dr. Kelly Moore. Dr. _x000D_
Moore is director of the Immunization Program at the Tennessee _x000D_
Department of Health. In this role, she is responsible for _x000D_
promoting proper use of recommended vaccines, as well as _x000D_
overseeing the response to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable _x000D_
disease._x000D_
    She has her undergraduate and medical degrees from _x000D_
Vanderbilt, and a master's of public health from Harvard School _x000D_
of Public Health. I'm completely objective, but the Tennessee _x000D_
Department of Public Health is one of the finest in the _x000D_
country._x000D_
    Dr. Mark Sawyer is professor of Clinical Pediatrics and a _x000D_
pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of _x000D_
California San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. _x000D_
He's also the medical director at San Diego Immunization _x000D_
Partnership and involved in a variety of immunization projects._x000D_
    Dr. Tim Jacks is a pediatrician and the father of two _x000D_
children who recently were exposed to measles in Arizona. He's _x000D_
an Every Child By Two immunization champion. Every Child By Two _x000D_
is a nonprofit dedicated to increasing vaccination rates among _x000D_
children. His wife is in Arizona caring for their two children. _x000D_
I'm grateful he could be here to tell their story._x000D_
    Dr. Moore, let's begin with you. If the three of you could _x000D_
summarize your comments in 5 minutes, we would appreciate it, _x000D_
and then the Senators will continue questioning."
2924361,2924360,2924362,19212,3,"    Thank you, Dr. Moore._x000D_

                               CA"
2924362,2924361,2924363,19212,4,"    Thank you, Dr. Sawyer._x000D_
    Dr. Jacks."
2924363,2924362,2924364,19212,5,"    Thank you, Dr. Jacks, for your personal _x000D_
story, and thank you, Dr. Sawyer and Dr. Moore._x000D_
    Now, we'll go to the Senators who have not yet had a chance _x000D_
to ask questions, and we'll begin with Senator Casey._x000D_
_x000D_
                       Statement of Senator Casey"
2924364,2924363,2924365,19212,6,"    Thank you, Senator Casey._x000D_
    Senator Murphy._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Murphy"
2924365,2924364,2924366,19212,6,"    Thank you, Senator Murphy._x000D_
    Senator Bennet._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Bennet"
2924366,2924365,2924367,19212,6,    That's 43 seconds----
2924367,2924366,2924368,19212,6,    We'll put it in the bank.
2924368,2924367,2924369,19212,7,"    We have time, and I'm sure all of us would _x000D_
probably like to have a second round of questions._x000D_
    Dr. Moore, I believe you said that the case of measles in _x000D_
Tennessee was in Memphis, an adult in Memphis. Is that correct?"
2924369,2924368,2924370,19212,7,    In west Tennessee.
2924370,2924369,2924371,19212,7,"    You described how you moved in quickly, and _x000D_
the number of people for just that one case that you had to be _x000D_
in touch with was how many?"
2924371,2924370,2924372,19212,7,"    This is an area where the vaccination rate _x000D_
for measles is what?"
2924372,2924371,2924373,19212,7,"    So it was high. Well, as Dr. Sawyer was _x000D_
talking earlier, I was thinking about the phrase, going viral, _x000D_
and then Dr. Jacks used it. This generation understands the _x000D_
idea of going viral._x000D_
    You're talking about measles flying through the air. That's _x000D_
unlike Ebola, that threw the country into a near--well, a _x000D_
complete panic, actually,--last fall, when Congress _x000D_
appropriated over $5 billion for Ebola-related efforts, and _x000D_
hospitals changed procedures. Ebola dominated what was going on _x000D_
in all the public health departments, yet it can only be spread _x000D_
through contact with bodily fluids. Measles flies through the _x000D_
air. This goes viral. This is a disease that goes viral._x000D_
    We Senators, in a bipartisan way, understand the problem of _x000D_
dealing with highly educated people who get bad information on _x000D_
the internet. That happens to us every day. We deal with that. _x000D_
We know what it is._x000D_
    Let's go back to the going viral. What if this person in _x000D_
west Tennessee, who Dr. Moore acted on quickly--what if that _x000D_
person had been discovered in a part of Los Angeles where 60 to _x000D_
70 percent of parents at certain schools have filed a personal _x000D_
belief exemption from immunization requirements. Describe the _x000D_
number of people and the multiplying of people that would have _x000D_
to be contacted to make certain that the disease didn't spread."
2924373,2924372,2924374,19212,7,"    You had 800 people, but then each of them _x000D_
might have infected someone else, right?"
2924374,2924373,2924375,19212,7,"    So when you say ``flies through the air,'' we _x000D_
have an example of going viral in modern parlance, I suppose._x000D_
    Dr. Jacks, this may not be an exact comparison, but people _x000D_
ask me why I continued to play the piano when I was young, and _x000D_
I remember responding that I didn't remember my mother giving _x000D_
me a choice about it. I guess I had a choice. We're not talking _x000D_
about taking choices away today from parents._x000D_
    We are talking about a conversation between a pediatrician _x000D_
and a parent. How strongly do you recommend to parents that _x000D_
they vaccinate their children? I suppose the most persuasive _x000D_
thing you can do is tell them the story of your own children. _x000D_
Do you just make a neutral observation about it, or do you come _x000D_
to a conclusion and say, ``I think you should do it?''"
2924375,2924374,2924376,19212,7,"    I'm out of time. I know in our State, years _x000D_
ago, my wife led an effort to establish a medical home for _x000D_
every child about to be born--prenatal healthcare. I assume _x000D_
anything in prenatal healthcare that allows a parent to know _x000D_
more about the value of vaccinations before the child is born _x000D_
is a very effective way to keep the vaccination rate high._x000D_
    Senator Murray."
2924376,2924375,2924377,19212,7,"    Thank you, Senator Murray._x000D_
    Senator Cassidy."
2924377,2924376,2924378,19212,7,    It will be done.
2924378,2924377,2924379,19212,8,"    This time bank is getting full. We've got _x000D_
Senator Franken."
2924379,2924378,2924380,19212,8,"    Thank you, Senator Franken._x000D_
    Senator Murray, do you have closing remarks?"
2924380,2924379,2924381,19212,8,"    I thank Senator Murray for her work and her _x000D_
staff's work in putting together such an extraordinary group of _x000D_
witnesses today. This has been very, very helpful, and not just _x000D_
to us, but to anyone who has been listening._x000D_
    Dr. Moore, we're, again, so proud of our public health _x000D_
department in Tennessee. I think back, not just on this, but on _x000D_
the quick reaction to the fungal meningitis episode, where your _x000D_
department saved lots of lives._x000D_
    Dr. Sawyer and Dr. Jacks, thank you for your leadership in _x000D_
your field and your testimony. The hope we have is that Dr. _x000D_
Jacks' message goes viral more rapidly than measles does, and _x000D_
that it goes fast._x000D_
    I have a hard time keeping my old Governor's hat off, and _x000D_
it makes me think of the importance of our State organizations. _x000D_
CDC really works through the States. The medical associations _x000D_
work through their legislatures and associations, and they're _x000D_
in touch with parents every day._x000D_
    We would like to take some step to solve this problem. The _x000D_
truth is, in my view, most of that reaction has to be with _x000D_
those who are closest to the parents and who see them _x000D_
regularly. The idea of a medical home for every child who is _x000D_
about to be born is probably the surest and best way for States _x000D_
to approach this, because parents who are talking to their _x000D_
pediatricians are going to make sure their children are _x000D_
vaccinated._x000D_
    I have some closing remarks I'm supposed to make._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 10 days. Members _x000D_
may submit additional information and questions for the record _x000D_
within that time. The next hearing will occur tomorrow at 9:30 _x000D_

2924381,2924380,2924382,19224,1,"    The Senate Committee on Health, Education, _x000D_
Labor, and Pensions will please come to order. This is our _x000D_
eighth hearing during this Congress on the reauthorization of _x000D_
the Higher Education Act._x000D_
    Senator Murray and I will each have an opening statement. _x000D_
Then we'll introduce our panel of witnesses. After our _x000D_
witnesses' testimony, Senators will have 5 minutes of questions _x000D_
each._x000D_
    We expect to have a vote at 10:30. We won't be deterred by _x000D_
that. We'll take turns with the gavel, so as long as Senators _x000D_
are here, we'll continue the line of questions so we don't slow _x000D_
things down._x000D_
    Today's hearing is really about finding out if there is a _x000D_
way the Federal Government can help more students finish _x000D_
college. Few students can afford to be stuck with debt and no _x000D_
degree, but that is what's happening to far too many college _x000D_
students. Federal aid programs are designed to help people _x000D_
working to earn a degree or a certificate in 1-, 2-, or 4-year _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    According to the National Student Clearinghouse, only 55 _x000D_
percent of any students complete a degree or certificate within _x000D_
6 years. The problem is even worse for low-income students: 8.6 _x000D_
million low-income students received Pell Grants from the _x000D_
Federal Government last year. Department of Education data says _x000D_
that only 45 percent of these students achieve a degree or _x000D_
certificate within 6 years._x000D_
    There are 7 million borrowers in default on their Federal _x000D_
student loans, and the Department of Education says that _x000D_
borrowers are three times more likely to be in this situation _x000D_
if they did not finish any degree or credential._x000D_
    We know that students who do not finish their program are _x000D_
less likely to benefit with a better job or salary._x000D_
    I'd like to briefly address today: Why are so many American _x000D_
college students leaving before they graduate? What role can _x000D_
the Federal Government play in, No. 1, encouraging students, _x000D_
particularly those receiving Pell Grants and other Federal _x000D_
financial aid, to finish what they've started; and, No. 2, _x000D_
encouraging colleges and universities to help their students _x000D_
make progress and graduate?_x000D_
    I'm going to submit my entire statement to the record, but _x000D_
let me summarize what it says._x000D_
    Why students aren't graduating seems to focus on these _x000D_
things:_x000D_
    Part-time enrollment and slow progress. Students with a _x000D_
full-time course load, meaning 15 credits per semester, who _x000D_
consistently enroll full-time are most likely to graduate. _x000D_
However, a 2013 survey of institutions showed the majority of _x000D_
so-called full-time college students aren't taking the credits _x000D_
needed to finish a 4-year degree for a bachelor's or in 2 years _x000D_
for an associate degree._x000D_
    Inadequate high school education. According to the _x000D_
Community College Research Center, most remedial students never _x000D_
get past remediation._x000D_
    Financial difficulties. Students from low-income _x000D_
backgrounds face pressures, making them more likely to drop _x000D_
out._x000D_
    What can the government do? Senator Bennet and I have _x000D_
offered a proposal to simplify the student aid application _x000D_
form, the FAFSA. Testimony before our committee said that it _x000D_
discourages as many as 2 million students from applying for _x000D_
Federal financial aid. Many students continue working or have _x000D_
to get a job while they're in school._x000D_
    Two years ago, Austin Peay State University in Clarksville _x000D_
testified at this committee about the success it has had with _x000D_
remedial education. Half of Austin Peay students need to take _x000D_
remedial courses once they're enrolled. The university _x000D_
redesigned its remedial education so that students who lack _x000D_
some skills in math, reading, or writing enroll in credit-_x000D_
bearing college courses with additional required workshops to _x000D_
help them catch up._x000D_
    Before using this approach, only 10 percent of the remedial _x000D_
math students ever completed a college-level math class. _x000D_
Seventy percent do now._x000D_
    A maximum Pell is often awarded to a student who is really _x000D_
not attending full-time. That's one reason. Federal aid does _x000D_
not encourage students to complete their degree as quickly as _x000D_
they can._x000D_
    Second--and your testimony reflects this--Federal aid _x000D_
progress requirements seem to lack teeth._x000D_
    Third, Federal aid today can be used to subsidize studies _x000D_
unfocused toward the degree. A student can use the Pell grant _x000D_
to take 90 credits, as many as 90, for a 60-credit associate's _x000D_
degree. The longer a student takes, the less likely they are to _x000D_
finish. Taking classes that get students off course from their _x000D_
goal could be detrimental to completion._x000D_
    Federal policy has emphasized access rather than _x000D_
completion. We are looking to see whether we need to find ways _x000D_
to encourage over 6,000 higher education institutions to _x000D_
prioritize and encourage student success without throwing a _x000D_
big, wet blanket of a Federal mandate that smothers _x000D_
universities, that might work at Austin Peay but might not work _x000D_
at the University of Maryland, that might be good at Yeshiva _x000D_
but might not be good at Harvard._x000D_
    We look forward to the testimony of the witnesses, and we _x000D_
thank you for coming."

get past remediation._x000D_
    <bullet> Financial difficulties: Students from low-income _x000D_
backgrounds face financial pressures during college that make _x000D_
them more likely to drop out._x000D_
_x000D_
    2. WHAT ROLE CAN THE GOVERNMENT PLAY IN ENCOURAGING GRADUATION?_x000D_
_x000D_
    Senator Bennet and I have a proposal to simplify the _x000D_
dreaded 108-question FAFSA to a simple postcard of about two _x000D_
questions. We understand that this will remove an obstacle that _x000D_
each year discourages about 2 million students from applying _x000D_
for Federal financial aid. And for some, it discourages _x000D_
reapplying for aid to continue in their studies._x000D_
    Many or even most of the students who are eligible but not _x000D_
applying and enrolling in college are low-income students who _x000D_
would be the first in their family to attend college._x000D_
    Some are adults already in the workforce._x000D_
    Many of the students may continue working or have to get a _x000D_
job while they attend school._x000D_
    Some institutions, including some of the ones we have _x000D_
represented here today, have found ways to provide students _x000D_
with needed support to progress through their classes and reach _x000D_
their ultimate goal--a degree or credential._x000D_
    Two years ago, Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, _x000D_
TN, testified in front of this committee about success it has _x000D_
had with remedial education._x000D_
    Half of Austin Peay students need to take remedial courses _x000D_
once they are enrolled._x000D_
    The university redesigned their remedial education so that _x000D_
students who lack some skills in mathematics, writing, or _x000D_
reading enroll in credit-bearing college courses, with _x000D_
additional required workshops to help them catch up._x000D_
    Before using this approach, only 10 percent of their _x000D_
remedial math students ever completed a college-level math _x000D_
class--now 70 percent do. Those students could never get their _x000D_
degree without passing that college-level math._x000D_
    Despite the good work of some institutions, today Federal _x000D_
aid does not encourage students to complete their degree as _x000D_
quickly as they can, which ideally is on time._x000D_
    First, maximum Pell is often awarded to a student who's _x000D_
really not attending full-time: For example, a student gets _x000D_
their full Pell grant amount if they take 24 credits in a year, _x000D_
but a student generally must take 30 credits a year to graduate _x000D_
on-time._x000D_
    Second, Federal aid progress requirements seem to lack _x000D_
teeth: Students must meet a ``satisfactory academic progress'' _x000D_
standard to remain eligible. This definition is set by _x000D_
institutions with broad requirements from Federal regulations, _x000D_
including a minimum grade point average and passing a minimum _x000D_
percentage of credits successfully._x000D_
    These requirements may not require enough focused _x000D_
progression through a degree or certificate program and the _x000D_
timing of the evaluation of progress can be too late for _x000D_
students to change course._x000D_
    Third, Federal aid today can be used to subsidize studies _x000D_
unfocused toward the degree: For example, a student can use _x000D_
their Pell grant to take 90 credits for a 60-credit associates _x000D_
degree._x000D_
    The longer a student takes, the less likely they are to _x000D_
finish, taking classes that get students off-course from their _x000D_
goal could be detrimental to completion._x000D_
    Of course, some students may want to take courses that _x000D_
don't help them meet requirements for graduation--but whether _x000D_
Federal aid should be allowed to be used for that is a question _x000D_
before the committee._x000D_
_x000D_
                               Conclusion_x000D_
_x000D_
    Federal policy has emphasized access rather than _x000D_
completion, and we recognize that college students are adults _x000D_
who have the autonomy and responsibility for making decisions _x000D_
for themselves._x000D_
    I think we need to find a way to encourage our over 6,000 _x000D_
institutions to prioritize and encourage student success _x000D_
without throwing a big, wet blanket of a Federal mandate--that _x000D_
smothers universities--that might work at Austin Peay but might _x000D_
not work at the University of Maryland, that might be good at _x000D_
Yeshiva but not at Harvard._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing a variety of successful _x000D_
strategies that are working or showing promise from our panel _x000D_
today._x000D_
    I believe the solutions that we hear will note that there _x000D_
is no one-size-fits-all solution to improving student success._x000D_
    I am particularly interested in hearing how Federal _x000D_
policies may hinder creative solutions or could better promote _x000D_
student progression toward on-time completion, saving the _x000D_
student money and allowing them to graduate with less debt._x000D_

                  Opening Statement of Senator Murray"
2924383,2924382,2924384,19224,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Higher education _x000D_
is really critical to ensuring the economic strength of our _x000D_
middle class, and I believe it is a critical part of building _x000D_
an economy that works for all of our families, not just the _x000D_
wealthiest few._x000D_
    Let's remember that in the years ahead, more and more jobs _x000D_
will actually require education beyond high school. We have an _x000D_
economic stake in helping as many students as possible go to _x000D_
college and complete their degrees. That is how we will remain _x000D_
competitive in the 21st century global economy._x000D_
    As we work together on this committee to reauthorize the _x000D_
Higher Education Act, there are a few principles I'm going to _x000D_
focus on to make sure that more students can pursue their _x000D_
degree. I'm going to continue to look for ways to make college _x000D_
more affordable and reduce the crushing burden of student debt. _x000D_
As we talked about last week, I will be especially focused on _x000D_
making sure students have access to a safe learning _x000D_
environment._x000D_
    More students from all walks of life should have strong, _x000D_
clear pathways into and through higher education. Creating _x000D_
pathways for student success is what we'll be focused on today, _x000D_
and it's clear there is lots of room for improvement._x000D_
    Federal data show that just 60 percent of first-time _x000D_
students who attend full-time complete their 4-year degrees _x000D_
within 6 years. Even fewer students complete their degrees on _x000D_
time. Many of the other 40 percent of students likely dropped _x000D_
out without the advantages of a college degree, while _x000D_
oftentimes trying to pay off student debt. Many students at _x000D_
community colleges struggle to make it to graduation or _x000D_
successfully transfer to a 4-year program._x000D_
    While college completion rates for students from more _x000D_
affluent backgrounds have increased over the past 40 years, the _x000D_
same is not true for students from low-income backgrounds. Just _x000D_
9 percent of people from the lowest-income bracket graduated _x000D_
with a college degree by the time they reached age 24. That's _x000D_
only up from 6 percent in 1970._x000D_
    Students today face many barriers to completing their _x000D_
degrees and credentials. There are several policies we can _x000D_
pursue to improve those completion rates. For one, in high _x000D_
school, we need to make sure that they graduate college- and _x000D_
career-ready. I'm glad that earlier this month, the Senate _x000D_
voted to pass a bipartisan bill from Chairman Alexander and I _x000D_
that would be a strong step in the right direction to do just _x000D_
that._x000D_
    Today, many students drop out because they worry about _x000D_
mounting student debt or they have family or work _x000D_
responsibilities that make it impossible for them to continue _x000D_
earning their degree. We also need to provide adequate _x000D_
financial aid and lower costs to help improve student success. _x000D_
We also need better data on student outcomes from colleges and _x000D_
universities if we're going to help students effectively._x000D_
    It is hard to believe, but higher education data ignores _x000D_
part-time students, transfer students, adults who are returning _x000D_
to school, students in remediation, and Pell grant recipients. _x000D_
We should know how these students are doing to make sure we're _x000D_
making effective policy decisions based on solid evidence._x000D_
    I'm very concerned that some of my colleagues have _x000D_
suggested penalizing financial aid recipients and students from _x000D_
low-income backgrounds by tightening eligibility and other _x000D_
requirements in a misguided effort to try to motivate their _x000D_
success. Recent research suggests the exact opposite. Students _x000D_
don't succeed when financial aid policies only serve to punish _x000D_
rather than reward and support._x000D_
    For first generation college students, for students from _x000D_
low-_x000D_
income backgrounds, and for students who are struggling in _x000D_
college, we need to incentivize institutions of higher _x000D_
education to have support systems in place. That includes _x000D_
structured pathways toward earning a degree so students see a _x000D_
clear route to graduation. It includes programs for college _x000D_
mentoring and advising so students stay on track. It includes _x000D_
individualized counseling for students who need extra help._x000D_
    When students have access to a support system, evidence _x000D_
shows that they are much more likely to complete their degrees. _x000D_
I'm looking forward to hearing from Dr. Richburg-Hayes on how _x000D_
increasing access to student services can help students, _x000D_
including the highly regarded CUNY ASAP program._x000D_
    To me, improving outcomes at colleges and universities is _x000D_
an important piece of our work to grow our economy from the _x000D_
middle out. The success of students today will help guarantee _x000D_
that our Nation will be able to compete and lead the world in _x000D_
the years to come. I look forward to hearing testimony from all _x000D_
of you today. I really appreciate you being here._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing."
2924384,2924383,2924385,19224,2,"    Thank you, Senator Murray._x000D_
    The vote was changed to 2 o'clock. So we won't have that _x000D_
interruption this morning due to the vote on the Senate floor._x000D_
    Our first witness today is Stan Jones, president and _x000D_
founder of Complete College America. His organization partners _x000D_
with States with a goal of substantially increasing the number _x000D_
of Americans with a postsecondary credential. Prior to founding _x000D_
Complete College America, he served 16 years in the Indiana _x000D_
legislature, was a senior advisor to Governor Bayh, and was _x000D_
Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education for a decade._x000D_
    Dr. Scott Ralls, president of North Carolina Community _x000D_
College System, is our next witness. This system serves almost _x000D_
830,000 people annually. During the last 10 years, over 40 _x000D_
percent of North Carolina's wage earners have been students at _x000D_
one of the State's 58 community colleges. Next month, Dr. Ralls _x000D_
will assume the presidency of Northern Virginia Community _x000D_
College System._x000D_
    Our next witness is Dr. Timothy Renick, vice provost, _x000D_
professor, and vice president for Enrollment Management and _x000D_
Student Success at Georgia State University. Over the past _x000D_
decade, Georgia State has doubled the number of at-risk _x000D_
students enrolled, but, more importantly, improved graduation _x000D_
rates by 22 percentage points and closed achievement gaps based _x000D_
on race and income._x000D_
    Both Senator Burr and Senator Isakson had hoped to be here _x000D_
and may still be here. They're in a Finance Committee meeting _x000D_
and wanted me to say that to both of you._x000D_
    Our final witness is Dr. Lashawn Richburg-Hayes, director _x000D_
for Young Adults and Postsecondary Education at MDRC, a _x000D_
nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research organization in New York _x000D_
City. Dr. Richburg-Hayes focuses her work on academic _x000D_
achievement and persistence for low-income students at _x000D_
community colleges and less selected 4-year colleges. She has _x000D_
overseen some of the most rigorous experiments on how financial _x000D_
aid can be provided to students in ways that cause them to _x000D_
change their behaviors in order to succeed in school._x000D_
    I look forward to everyone's testimony. If each of you _x000D_
would summarize your comments in about 5 minutes, that'll leave _x000D_
more time for us to have a conversation with you in our _x000D_
questioning._x000D_
    Why don't we start with you, Mr. Jones, and go right down _x000D_
the line."
2924385,2924384,2924386,19224,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Murray, and _x000D_
other members of the committee. Many of the remarks that you _x000D_
both made highlight my testimony._x000D_
    Complete College America is an alliance of States. We work _x000D_
with 35 States across the country. We primarily work with _x000D_
States, Governors, legislators, and key higher education _x000D_
officials. We're entirely funded by foundations, like the Gates _x000D_
Foundation, Lumina, Carnegie, and Kellogg._x000D_
    Just to highlight some of the points you made, I thought it _x000D_
was interesting that during the peak of the recession, when the _x000D_
most people were out of work, we had record breaking enrollment _x000D_
across this country at our colleges. At most colleges, it was _x000D_
record breaking, especially the community colleges._x000D_
    It really points out that people are willing to go to _x000D_
college, are desperate to go to college, in order to better _x000D_
themselves. I have a handout here that I'm not going to go _x000D_
through, but I'm just going to refer to it from time to time._x000D_
    Even given the huge amount of effort that we've made in _x000D_
access, the bottom quartile, income-wise--only 10 percent of _x000D_
those students get a 4-year college degree. From the second _x000D_
income quartile, only 15 percent get a 4-year college degree, _x000D_
and from the third income quartile, only about 34 percent of _x000D_
those students get a 4-year college degree._x000D_
    College really only works for those in the upper quartile, _x000D_
and that's a combination of factors. For so many students, it's _x000D_
the structure of our colleges and universities that have failed _x000D_
them._x000D_
    As both Senators have pointed out, we don't graduate _x000D_
students in any sector except the flagships and the private _x000D_
sector. Community college graduation rates can range from 15 _x000D_
percent to 25 percent. Four-year, non-flagship rates can range _x000D_
about 40 percent, and virtually nobody graduates on time._x000D_
    We put out a report about 6 months ago called Four-Year _x000D_
Myth. Hardly anybody graduates in 4 years. Even at the _x000D_
flagships, less than half of those students graduate in 4 _x000D_
years. We found in our report that out of 580 public, 4-year _x000D_
universities, only 50 graduated 50 percent of their students _x000D_
within 4 years._x000D_
    Students take longer, obviously, to get a degree than they _x000D_
used to--3.6 years at a 2-year college and 4.9 years at many 4-_x000D_
year colleges. Not surprisingly, the fifth year, the sixth _x000D_
year, costs more money, but it's also lost wages in the _x000D_
workforce._x000D_
    Two studies by two different universities, the University _x000D_
of Texas and Temple University, indicate that student debt _x000D_
really spikes after the fourth year. Students have run out of _x000D_
traditional resources. A 70 percent increase in student debt _x000D_
occurs after that fourth year._x000D_
    We have focused on what we call our game changers, things _x000D_
that significantly make a difference. There's only five of them _x000D_
that we recommend. Senator Alexander has referred to several._x000D_
    One is transparency of information. Many colleges and many _x000D_
States are completely unaware of the remediation crisis, for _x000D_
example, that we have, the lack of completion that we have, how _x000D_
long it takes students. This is not data that the Federal _x000D_
Government collects. We don't collect at the Federal level _x000D_
graduation rates for Pell students, for example._x000D_
    The billions of dollars we spend on Pell--we don't know _x000D_
whether those students graduate or not. I know it's been back _x000D_
and forth, back and forth, about whether we even know whether _x000D_
the veterans graduate or not. There's some core--not many, but _x000D_
some core things that the Federal Government could collect in _x000D_
terms of transparency around these key issues._x000D_
    It's hard for policymakers at your level, at the State _x000D_
level, to make these decisions without having graduation rates _x000D_
for Pell students, graduation rates for veterans, graduation _x000D_
rates for transfer students, remediation rates. This _x000D_
information simply doesn't exist._x000D_
    Senator Alexander mentioned remediation. Sixty percent of _x000D_
all students at community colleges start in remediation. Very _x000D_
few finish. As he pointed out, Austin Peay has a great model. _x000D_
They're taking it statewide. Similar models like that are being _x000D_
taken statewide in about a half a dozen States. This could be _x000D_
done--right now, you allow 30 credit hours of Pell. Some of _x000D_
that money could be used to support students in credit-bearing _x000D_
classes._x000D_
    Just a couple of other things in the seconds that I have _x000D_
remaining. Structure is hugely important. Again, in Tennessee, _x000D_
you have the Tennessee tech centers, Senator, and their _x000D_
graduation rate is about 75 percent to 80 percent. The _x000D_
placement rate is about 80 percent. That's about five times the _x000D_
rate in terms of graduation as typical community colleges with _x000D_
similar programs._x000D_
    It really is all about structure. These programs, where _x000D_
they've been duplicated, have shown significant success._x000D_
    The last one I want to mention, which you referenced, is 15 _x000D_
credit hours. The Pell program does not incent students to take _x000D_
more than 12. De facto, most students in the country full-time _x000D_
take 12 credit hours or less, so they're already on the 5-year _x000D_
plan. We would propose thinking about providing incentives for _x000D_
students to take 15 credit hours._x000D_
    There are some examples here where States and institutions _x000D_
that have done that have doubled in 1 year the numbers of _x000D_
students that are taking 15 credit hours or more. They're more _x000D_
likely to graduate and, clearly, more likely to graduate on _x000D_
time._x000D_
    These things can be done. It's not a problem with the _x000D_
students. It's not a problem with faculty. It's a problem with _x000D_
how we've structured these institutions. By providing more _x000D_
structure, like the Tennessee tech centers, which is very _x000D_
simple--you mentioned the SAP program in New York City--also _x000D_
very simple. Students go in the morning, Monday through Friday, _x000D_
8 to 12. It's a block schedule. Or they go in the afternoon and _x000D_
it's a block schedule. Tennessee tech centers--the same way._x000D_
    Tennessee tech centers take attendance, an underappreciated _x000D_
strategy. That's why they can get 75 percent to 80 percent _x000D_
completion rates._x000D_
    A lot of these issues can be addressed----"
2924386,2924385,2924387,19224,2,"    We need to wind down and go to the next _x000D_

2924387,2924386,2924388,19224,2,"    Sure. In conclusion, what we recommend are only _x000D_
four or five game changers that provide substantial success--_x000D_
performance funding is another one--and have provided success _x000D_
as these have been implemented across colleges and States._x000D_

    For the last 6 years, Complete College America has worked closely _x000D_
with 33 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the _x000D_
Northern Mariana Islands with a single mission in mind: increase the _x000D_
number of Americans with a college degree or credential of value, and _x000D_
close persistent attainment gaps for traditionally underrepresented _x000D_
populations._x000D_
    This critical work has been driven by the reality that despite _x000D_
decades of work in the access agenda, America faces a college _x000D_
completion crisis. A failure to act decisively on these issues would _x000D_
perpetuate an ongoing skills gap that threatens our economic future and _x000D_
degrades our intellectual leadership around the world._x000D_
    The strategies outlined below are instrumental in achieving those _x000D_
successes. The Game Changers are designed to give States and campuses _x000D_
the greatest return on investment. These strategies, which we are _x000D_
working to implement every day, are achieving transformational results _x000D_
around the country--gains in student success that are 20, 30 or 40 _x000D_
percentage points greater than current practices._x000D_
_x000D_
    <bullet> Corequisite Remediation--Default many more unprepared _x000D_
students into college-level gateway courses with mandatory, just-in-_x000D_
time instructional support parallel to high structured coursework._x000D_
    <bullet> Fifteen to Finish--Inform and incentivize students to _x000D_
attend full-time and ensure that full-time means 15 credits per _x000D_
semester or 30 credits per year. Use banded tuition so that 15 credits _x000D_
per semester cost students no more than 12 credits._x000D_
    <bullet> Guided Pathways to Success (GPS)--Enabled by technology, _x000D_
default students into highly structured degree plans, not individual _x000D_
courses. Start students in a limited number of meta-majors, which _x000D_
narrow into majors. Map out every semester of study for the entire _x000D_
program, and guarantee that milestone courses will be available when _x000D_
needed. Use built-in early warning systems to alert advisers when _x000D_
students fall behind._x000D_
    <bullet> Structured Schedules--Help working students balance jobs _x000D_
and school by using structured scheduling of classes to add _x000D_
predictability to their busy lives--doing so enables many more students _x000D_
to attend college full-time, shortening their time to completion and _x000D_
reducing costs of attendance._x000D_
    <bullet> Performance Funding--Pay for performance, not just _x000D_
enrollment. Use the CCA/NGA metrics to tie State funding to student _x000D_
progression and completion._x000D_
_x000D_
    There are any number of innovations we can employ to move the _x000D_
needle on college completion, but the magnitude of these challenges _x000D_
requires that our reforms be structural and systemic. The Game Changers _x000D_
are proven strategies that lead to real and lasting results. When it _x000D_
comes to college completion, our Nation cannot afford to wait any _x000D_
longer. We must take action now._x000D_

                              introduction_x000D_
    Since our founding in 2009, Complete College America has worked _x000D_
closely with 33 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth _x000D_
of the Northern Mariana Islands with a single mission in mind: increase _x000D_
the number of Americans with a college degree or credential of value, _x000D_
and close persistent attainment gaps for traditionally underrepresented _x000D_
populations._x000D_
    This critical work has been driven by the reality that America _x000D_
faces a college completion crisis, and a failure to act decisively on _x000D_
these issues would perpetuate an ongoing skills gap that threatens our _x000D_
economic future and degrades our intellectual leadership around the _x000D_
world._x000D_
    A look at the data shows just how serious this challenge is for our _x000D_
country: only 4 percent of full-time students complete an associate _x000D_
degree on time, that is, within 2 academic years. At non-flagship, 4-_x000D_
year institutions, only 19 percent complete their degree on time. Even _x000D_
given 3 years for an associate degree and 6 years for a bachelor's _x000D_
degree, these numbers inch up only slightly to 13 percent and 45 _x000D_
percent respectively. For part-time students, the results are even more _x000D_
discouraging._x000D_
    These consistently low completion rates come at a great cost to _x000D_
students and their families. In our 2014 report, Four-Year Myth, we _x000D_
outlined that each additional year of college costs 2-year students _x000D_
over $50,000 in tuition, fees, lost wages, and other expenses and close _x000D_
to $70,000 for 4-year students. Further, data taken from Temple _x000D_
University and University of Texas-Austin show that 2 extra years at _x000D_
their campuses increase debt by nearly 70 percent among students who _x000D_
borrow. Add it all up, and everyone loses. The public invests in _x000D_
college studies that--for too many students--often lead nowhere. _x000D_
Students defer earning income, and they and their families take on _x000D_
massive amounts of debt to earn degrees that could be much less time _x000D_
consuming and costly._x000D_
    Additionally, while we have experienced great success in the _x000D_
college access agenda, a closer look at graduation day reveals that _x000D_
those who do eventually earn degrees are not representative of the rich _x000D_
diversity that defines this Nation. The hopes raised by nearly _x000D_
equitable enrollments in the freshman class for students of color, low-_x000D_
income students, and first generation students are crushed by gaps in _x000D_
achievement and completion._x000D_
    Taken together, this crisis costs our Nation and the States _x000D_
billions of dollars, contributes to the more than $1 trillion in _x000D_
student loan debt, and stifles our economic growth._x000D_
    There is no doubt that the mission to boost college completion and _x000D_
success is a difficult one, but this work is critical. Complete College _x000D_
America's Alliance of States, now at 35 members, is ensuring that both _x000D_
colleges and higher education policymakers value access and success _x000D_
equally. We are working together to identify and enact powerful reforms _x000D_
that help students succeed. New laws are being forged. New policies are _x000D_
being implemented. And students are beginning to enjoy the rewards of a _x000D_
reinvented system of American higher education._x000D_
    The strategies outlined below are instrumental in achieving those _x000D_
successes. The Game Changers are designed to give States and campuses _x000D_
the greatest return on investment. These strategies, which we are _x000D_
working to implement every day, are achieving transformational results _x000D_
around the country--gains in student success that are 20, 30 or 40 _x000D_
percentage points greater than current practices. The success of these _x000D_
efforts are the result of tackling systemic problems head on, ensuring _x000D_
that many more Americans earn a degree or other credentials of value. _x000D_
Now, our challenge is to see that these powerful ideas are taken to _x000D_
scale around the country._x000D_
                        corequisite remediation_x000D_
    For far too many students in the United States, college begins--and _x000D_
often ends--in remediation. Of the 1.7 million students assigned to _x000D_
this broken system each year, only about 1 in 10 will graduate. Seventy _x000D_
percent of students placed into remedial math fail to enroll in the _x000D_
college-level gateway course within 2 academic years._x000D_
    Efforts around the country have shown that the best way to support _x000D_
students who are currently placed into remedial education is to put _x000D_
them directly into college-level courses with additional academic _x000D_
support. By providing remediation as a corequisite--not as a _x000D_
prerequisite sequence that sets students back--we eliminate the all to _x000D_
frequent problem of remedial students never making it to a college-_x000D_
level course. Institutions that have adopted corequisite approaches _x000D_
have reduced attrition and seen dramatic increases in student success._x000D_
    Corequisite remediation is implemented in a number of ways: as an _x000D_
additional class period alongside the college-level course, a required _x000D_
lab with mentors, or 5 weeks of remediation followed by 10 weeks of the _x000D_
regular course. The overarching goal is to free students from long _x000D_
remedial sequences that do not count toward a degree and that create _x000D_
more points at which students are likely to drop out._x000D_
    In States and institutions where corequisite remediation is being _x000D_
utilized, the results have been astounding. In places like Colorado, _x000D_
Indiana, Tennessee and West Virginia, data shows that students enrolled _x000D_
in single-semester, corequisite English typically succeed at twice the _x000D_
rate of students enrolled in traditional prerequisite English courses. _x000D_
Students enrolled in corequisite gateway math courses saw results five _x000D_
to six times the success rates of traditional remedial math sequences._x000D_
_x000D_
    <bullet> West Virginia: Under the leadership of Chancellor Jim _x000D_
Skidmore, the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia _x000D_
scaled corequisite remediation across its campuses. Under the _x000D_
corequisite model, 68 percent of students completed gateway English _x000D_
within one semester, up from 37 percent within 2 years under the _x000D_
traditional model. In mathematics, success rates increased from 14 _x000D_
percent under the traditional model to 62 percent under corequisite _x000D_
remediation._x000D_
    <bullet> Tennessee: The Tennessee Board of Regents reports that _x000D_
under corequisite remediation, gateway course success rates increased _x000D_
from 12 percent to 63 percent in math and from 31 percent to 74 percent _x000D_
in English. Additionally, Tennessee's data shows that students at every _x000D_
level of academic preparedness (based on ACT sub-scores) did better _x000D_
under the new model._x000D_
_x000D_
    Seven States have committed to scaling corequisite remediation by _x000D_
2015. Twenty-two States and the District of Columbia have committed to _x000D_
transforming remediation to dramatically increase the percentage of _x000D_
students who complete college-level gateway courses in math and English _x000D_
within 1 academic year._x000D_
                           fifteen to finish_x000D_
    As mentioned above, the vast majority of American college students, _x000D_
and almost no one at community colleges, graduates on time, costing _x000D_
families billions._x000D_
    One frustratingly simple reason for late completion is that most _x000D_
college students are not taking enough credits (at least 30) each _x000D_
academic year to finish within 2 or 4 years--an unintended consequence _x000D_
of flawed Federal policy and misguided conceptions about what is in the _x000D_
best interest of students._x000D_
    Research has shown that when students take at least 30 credits in _x000D_
their first year, they earn better grades, they are more likely to be _x000D_
retained from 1 year to the next, and they graduate at a higher rate--_x000D_
regardless of their level of academic preparation._x000D_
    Fifteen to Finish campaigns--which originated at the University of _x000D_
Hawaii System, have been launched across the country, both on campuses _x000D_
and statewide, to encourage more students to take at least 15 credits _x000D_
per semester or 30 credits per year. Citing information on college _x000D_
affordability and time to degree, these campaigns--ranging from print _x000D_
advertisements on campus to creative infomercials--urge students to _x000D_
take the credits necessary to complete on time._x000D_
    Additionally, States are implementing policy changes to encourage _x000D_
greater enrollment intensity, including banded tuition, in which _x000D_
students are charged the same amount of tuition regardless of whether _x000D_
they take 15 credits or the customary 12. The incentive for students to _x000D_
make use of this opportunity is that enrolling in a heavier course load _x000D_
not only reduces the cost they pay per credit but saves all the other _x000D_
expenses associated with an extra semester or year on campus. At the _x000D_
city colleges of Chicago, students are offered two free summer courses _x000D_
if they enroll in 15 credits for both the fall and spring semesters._x000D_
_x000D_
    <bullet> Indiana: At Indiana University-Purdue University, _x000D_
Indianapolis, more than half of students are now enrolling in enough _x000D_
credits to graduate on time, up from 28 percent the year before. Purdue _x000D_
University-Calumet increased the number of students taking 15 credits _x000D_
from 40 percent in 2013 to 66 percent in 2014._x000D_
    <bullet> Ohio: At the University of Akron, Fifteen to Finish _x000D_
efforts led to a 28 percent increase in the number of full-time _x000D_
freshmen taking at least 15 credit hours per semester._x000D_
_x000D_
    Twenty-four States have either statewide or campus-based Fifteen to _x000D_
Finish initiatives to encourage more students to take at least 15 _x000D_
credits per semester or 30 credits per year._x000D_
                    guided pathways to success (gps)_x000D_
    One of the most important hindrances to timely college completion _x000D_
is that students often have no clear path to graduation. They are faced _x000D_
with hundreds of majors, countless course offerings, and far too few _x000D_
academic advisors. Take together, these things result in students _x000D_
having to many choices and not nearly enough guidance._x000D_
    The result: students wander through the curriculum, taking courses _x000D_
that do not count toward their degrees and exhausting their financial _x000D_
aid. The courses they do need are often unavailable. At 2-year _x000D_
institutions, students rack up 81 credits rather than the standard 60 _x000D_
credits and take 3.6 years to complete. At 4-year, non-flagship _x000D_
institutions, students take 134 credits rather than 120 and take close _x000D_
to 5 years to complete. College ends up taking too long and costing too _x000D_
much, and too few complete._x000D_
    Guided Pathways to Success (GPS) addresses these issues directly. _x000D_
By building highly structured degree plans as default pathways to on-_x000D_
time graduation, States can place every college student on a road to _x000D_
success. Rather than being considered ``unclassified,'' students can _x000D_
select meta-majors and are given semester-by-semester plans that lay _x000D_
out a clear path to completion._x000D_
_x000D_
    <bullet> Florida: At Florida State University, degree maps combined _x000D_
with other GPS strategies increased on-time graduation rates from 44 _x000D_
percent to 61 percent. Additionally, attainment gaps have narrowed. _x000D_
African American, Hispanic and first-generation Pell students graduate _x000D_
from FSU at significantly higher rates than the national average._x000D_
    <bullet> Arizona: The use of GPS strategies in Arizona State _x000D_
University's eAdvisor system increased on-time graduation rates by _x000D_
nearly 16 percentage points._x000D_
    <bullet> Georgia: The use of GPS, specifically intrusive advising, _x000D_
at Georgia State University has wiped out attainment gaps entirely: _x000D_
African American and Hispanic students now graduate at higher rates _x000D_
than the overall student body._x000D_
_x000D_
    Four States are working to take GPS to scale, and five States are _x000D_
implementing GPS in STEM. Seven cities around the country are working _x000D_
to implement GPS through our Community Partnerships for Attainment._x000D_
                          structured schedules_x000D_
    Seventy-five percent of today's college students are commuters, _x000D_
often juggling families, jobs and school. But even in the face of this _x000D_
``new majority,'' much of American higher education has gone unchanged._x000D_
    Most students begin college with the expectation of attending full-_x000D_
time and completing within 2 or 4 years. But quickly the cold realities _x000D_
hit them. Remedial classes block their entrance into programs of study. _x000D_
The courses necessary to stay on track are not available. Bit by bit, _x000D_
full-time becomes part time and, all too often, students become 1 of _x000D_
the 30 million who have some college credit but no degree._x000D_
    While there will always be those who insist on or need to go to _x000D_
college part time, we must look for ways to help more students attend _x000D_
full-time. Structured schedules--for example, going to school every day _x000D_
from 8 to noon or from 1 to 5--provide daily certainty that allows for _x000D_
easier scheduling. Students can predict their course requirements and _x000D_
arrange schedule with employers and childcare providers without the _x000D_
complications of day-to-day and semester-by-semester alterations._x000D_
    Under this Game Changer, many more students are able to manage a _x000D_
full-time load and completion becomes twice as likely. Additionally, _x000D_
structured schedules for part-time students can help them increase _x000D_
credit accumulation toward successful completion. States should _x000D_
redirect the good intentions that led to limitless part-time enrollment _x000D_
and make the necessary changes to deploy structured schedules across _x000D_
their campuses._x000D_
_x000D_
    <bullet> Tennessee: Structured schedules have regularly produced _x000D_
graduation rates of 75 percent or higher for career certificates at the _x000D_
Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology._x000D_
    <bullet> New York: Structured schedules through the CUNY ASAP _x000D_
program have led to graduation rates double that of peers in _x000D_
traditional schedules._x000D_
_x000D_
    Seven States have programs within them that currently utilize _x000D_
structured schedules._x000D_
                          performance funding_x000D_
    In the past, taxpayers in most States have supported higher _x000D_
education based on the number of students enrolled on or around the _x000D_
12th day of the semester. Consequently, colleges and universities have _x000D_
had few financial incentives to prioritize student success._x000D_
    Under performance funding, institutions receive State dollars based _x000D_
on factors such as credit accumulation, remedial student success in _x000D_
gateway courses, and degree completion. While institutions are still _x000D_
rewarded for enrollment and access, progress and success are equally _x000D_
valued._x000D_
    To date, 26 States have implemented or are in the process of _x000D_
implementing performance funding. While this strategy cannot guarantee _x000D_
more college graduates, it can help ensure that campuses are motivated _x000D_
to adopt successful reforms. Simply put, money focuses minds._x000D_
                       actions congress can take_x000D_
    <bullet> Address gaps in the integrated Postsecondary Education _x000D_
Data System (IPEDS). The current data collection system does not fully _x000D_
capture the needs of today's students. Data is currently unavailable _x000D_
regarding part-time students, transfer students, students aged 25 or _x000D_
older, gateway course success for remedial students, credit _x000D_
accumulation, time to degree, courses completion, and most importantly, _x000D_
the system does not track Pell students. Ultimately, IPEDS data does a _x000D_
very poor job of counting all students._x000D_
    <bullet> Incentivize students to take 15 credits per semester. _x000D_
Based on a recent survey commissioned by Complete College America, most _x000D_
``full-time'' students are not taking the credits needed to graduate on _x000D_
time. Federal and State policies should encourage students to take at _x000D_
least 15 credits per semester or 30 credits per year. For example, _x000D_
reinstate year-round Pell grant funding that enables students to _x000D_
accumulate the credits necessary to graduate on time, including _x000D_
allowing students to receive Pell Grant resources through 15 credits, _x000D_
rather than the current 12 credit limit._x000D_
    <bullet> Encourage Pell grants to provide students the opportunity _x000D_
to complete remediation and a college-level course within their first _x000D_
academic year._x000D_
    <bullet> Consider a Pell bonus for institutions that enroll high _x000D_
numbers of Pell students to help colleges do more to become high _x000D_
quality institutions._x000D_
    <bullet> For legislation such as America's College Promise, do more _x000D_
to support and incentivize colleges to implement Game Changer _x000D_
strategies to create ``high quality institutions'' as referenced in the _x000D_
original proposal._x000D_
_x000D_
    There are any number of innovations we can employ to move the _x000D_
needle on college completion, but the magnitude of these challenges _x000D_
requires that our reforms be structural and systemic. The Game Changers _x000D_
are proven strategies that lead to real and lasting results. When it _x000D_
comes to college completion, our Nation cannot afford to wait any _x000D_
longer. We must take action now."

    Senator Isakson, I already introduced Dr. Renick. Would you _x000D_
like to say some words about him?"
2924391,2924390,2924392,19224,4,"    I want to brag about him, because----"

                      Statement of Senator Isakson"
2924393,2924392,2924394,19224,4,"    I've done that. Two years ago, I bragged _x000D_
about Georgia State University and, in particular, the Panther _x000D_
Grant Program, which was an innovation of the university and _x000D_
which Dr. Renick uses today to see to it that students almost _x000D_
on the verge of dropping out because of a minimal financial _x000D_
problem get a minimal financial need met so they can stay in _x000D_
school and graduate._x000D_
    It's interesting to note that other than Panther grants, _x000D_
they've also developed a student tracking system that tracks _x000D_
over 30,000 students at the university and measures them _x000D_
against 800 unique identifiers which indicate pitfalls they _x000D_
could actually have toward graduation. Georgia State is doing a _x000D_
remarkable job. Most notably of all, they now grant more _x000D_
bachelor degrees to African American graduates than any _x000D_
university in the United States of America._x000D_
    I'm very proud to have Dr. Renick here today, and I'm very _x000D_
proud of Georgia State University."

 STATEMENT OF LASHAWN RICHBURG-HAYES, Ph."
2924396,2924395,2924397,19224,5,"    Good morning, Chairman Alexander, _x000D_
Ranking Member Murray, and members of the committee. Thank you _x000D_
for inviting me to testify here today on what research tells us _x000D_
about ways to improve academic success among low-income college _x000D_
students._x000D_
    My organization, MDRC, is known for conducting large-scale _x000D_
evaluations and demonstration projects to test the impacts and _x000D_
cost effectiveness of education and social programs. Many of _x000D_
our studies use a random assignment research design, which is _x000D_
the most rigorous method for assessing such programs._x000D_
    As was mentioned earlier today by a number of the Senators _x000D_
and others, our challenge really is to develop more _x000D_
opportunities for low-income students to both attend and _x000D_
succeed at institutions of higher learning. Fortunately, _x000D_
research is beginning to point the way toward some solutions in _x000D_
four primary areas: first, comprehensive and integrated _x000D_
reforms; second, developmental education reforms; third, _x000D_
structured pathways; and, fourth, innovations in financial aid._x000D_
    I'll share some of the main lessons from this existing _x000D_
research. In terms of comprehensive and integrated programs, _x000D_
we've learned from the City University of New York's ASAP _x000D_
program, the Accelerated Study in Associates Program, that such _x000D_
integrated and comprehensive programs can make a sizable _x000D_
difference in graduation rates._x000D_
    ASAP is designed to help students nearly double the rate at _x000D_
which they graduate within 3 years. It consists primarily of _x000D_
four components: requirements and messages around attending _x000D_
college full-time, which, in this program, is defined as 12 _x000D_
credits per semester; student services, which entails having _x000D_
advising services for students in the program, including career _x000D_
advisement; course enrollment or structured pathways; and _x000D_
financial support, including financial incentives through _x000D_
textbook vouchers and transportation cards._x000D_
    These components resulted in very large impacts, the _x000D_
largest impacts among any random assignment study of a _x000D_
postsecondary intervention. Students in the ASAP program _x000D_
graduated at a rate of 18.3 percentage points higher than their _x000D_
control group counterparts. This is almost a doubling of the _x000D_
graduation rate in 3 years among community college students, _x000D_
all of whom were Pell eligible and most of whom were students _x000D_
of color._x000D_
    It also lowered the cost per degree at the 3-year point, _x000D_
lower than the control condition, meaning that the program was _x000D_
also cost-effective._x000D_
    In terms of other research, research has identified _x000D_
strategies for improving developmental education outcomes as _x000D_
well. As was mentioned earlier today, students needing _x000D_
remediation actually require more services, and it's necessary _x000D_
to address this issue to improve the graduation rates, because _x000D_
differences in outcomes vary by socioeconomic status, making _x000D_
gaps in achievement evident._x000D_
    Several random assignment interventions have been conducted _x000D_
thus far that suggest that there are modest impacts and _x000D_
improvement that are possible through such interventions. At _x000D_
this point, we have second generation interventions--including _x000D_
new ways to assess incoming students to provide them with _x000D_
services before they enroll in college, and to improve and _x000D_
accelerate developmental education teaching--that are currently _x000D_
being evaluated, and findings are not yet available._x000D_
    Structured pathway approaches have been shown to have some _x000D_
promise. Among the many structured pathway programs out there, _x000D_
ASAP is one example of a program that has implemented a lot of _x000D_
elements that are touted in the research as being useful._x000D_
    Financial aid is also another important lever to help low-_x000D_
income students succeed. Studies demonstrate that incentive-_x000D_
based grants and innovation on traditional financial aid result _x000D_
in a larger proportion of students meeting academic benchmarks, _x000D_
a greater number of credits earned, and modest effects on GPA._x000D_
    Building on what we already know, my written testimony _x000D_
offers a number of recommendations in two broad categories. _x000D_
First, give colleges and States incentives to replicate proven _x000D_
programs. For example, the Federal Government could support the _x000D_
spread of ASAP and other interventions with strong evidence of _x000D_
effectiveness._x000D_
    Second, encourage innovation paired with research, _x000D_
particularly rigorous research, so that we continue to identify _x000D_
programs that make a real difference. Specifically, additional _x000D_
research could be conducted into structured pathways, an area _x000D_
for which little is known currently beyond programs such as _x000D_
ASAP, year-round financial aid, and innovations in work-study _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify here today, _x000D_
and I look forward to questions you may have."
2924397,2924396,2924398,19224,6,"    Thank you. We'll begin those questions now _x000D_
with a round of 5-minute questions for Senators._x000D_
    One of the tempting things to do when you hear great _x000D_
stories of success like this is to say, ``OK. That sounds good. _x000D_
Let's just make everybody do it.'' That usually isn't the right _x000D_
thing to do, even as impressive as Georgia State's progress has _x000D_
been._x000D_
    One question might be: Should we require, should we _x000D_
encourage, should we change something about the Federal _x000D_
requirement that you've got to take 12 hours to qualify for a _x000D_
student grant or a student loan when there's so much evidence _x000D_
that if you take--if that puts you on a track to taking more _x000D_
time than 4 years or 2 years or 1 year to get your certificate, _x000D_
is there something wrong with requiring Federal student aid to _x000D_
be based upon 15 credits instead of 12?_x000D_
    Or if there's something wrong with that, is there some way _x000D_
we could encourage colleges to do that? Why aren't more _x000D_
colleges and institutions doing that? I know in Tennessee, once _x000D_
they focused on student success, they were wise enough to let _x000D_
different campuses do it different ways. Austin Peay focused on _x000D_
remediation, as you talked about. UT Knoxville told its _x000D_
students that you may take 12 hours if you want to, but you're _x000D_
going to pay for 15, and they began to see an immediate _x000D_
increase in the number of students who took 15 hours._x000D_
    What should we do about that, and what should we not do _x000D_
about it?_x000D_
    Mr. Jones."
2924398,2924397,2924399,19224,6,"    I'm glad you mentioned that, because the Pell _x000D_
grant not only has an effect by itself, but it has the effect _x000D_
of changing every university's financial aid program, every _x000D_
State's financial aid program to be de facto at 12 credit _x000D_
hours. You'd have a huge ripple effect if you would incent _x000D_
students to take 15 credit hours._x000D_
    Those colleges that have done this--this started in _x000D_
Hawaii--have had their incoming freshmen essentially double the _x000D_
number of students taking 15 credit hours just in 1 year. How I _x000D_
would do it at the Federal level would not be to necessarily _x000D_
raise to 15, but students get so many semesters. I would incent _x000D_
them, to say, ``If you take 15, we'll just take it off the back _x000D_
end of what you might have been eligible for 6 years later.'' _x000D_
That would benefit the student and benefit the taxpayer as _x000D_
well."
2924399,2924398,2924400,19224,6,"    You're right. We spend $130 billion a year in _x000D_
grants and loans. If we make a single change like that, it _x000D_
affects millions of students and 6,000 institutions. What's the _x000D_
down side of that?"
2924400,2924399,2924401,19224,6,    I guess I wouldn't want to penalize students----
2924401,2924400,2924402,19224,6,    Let me ask Mr. Ralls.
2924402,2924401,2924403,19224,6,"    So you'd leave that to the State system, for _x000D_
example, to make judgments about that?"
2924403,2924402,2924404,19224,6,"    Let me ask about remediation. There's been a _x000D_
shift in that over the last 30 years, at least, that I've seen. _x000D_
In our State, we thought we'd made great progress to say, ``You _x000D_
may come to the community college, but if you're not prepared _x000D_
for it, you don't get credit for the courses you take.''_x000D_
    Based upon your testimony, Mr. Jones, that's sort of a _x000D_
bridge to nowhere. Only 1 in 10 remedial students will ever _x000D_
graduate._x000D_
    The Austin Peay experience took a different approach, as I _x000D_
understand it, and said, ``Come on in if you need remedial _x000D_
help, and we'll just find other ways to help you succeed,'' and _x000D_
they had a great success story from that._x000D_
    Dr. Renick, what's your advice about how we deal with _x000D_
remediation? Are there any changes in Federal policy or _x000D_
incentives that we should include in the Higher Education Act?"
2924404,2924403,2924405,19224,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Murray."
2924405,2924404,2924406,19224,6,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Just _x000D_
following on your first question, sometimes our higher _x000D_
education policy is driven by our own memories of what we did _x000D_
in our college experience rather than what's actually happening _x000D_
today, when more and more students are worrying about a lot _x000D_
more than college classes. They might be parents. They are _x000D_
working two or three jobs to pay for college today._x000D_
    I want to make sure that we don't disenfranchise those _x000D_
students who are struggling the most by setting a bar that _x000D_
makes it impossible for them to meet. We have to be very _x000D_
careful with that._x000D_
    Mr. Ralls, I appreciate your comments on that._x000D_
    Dr. Richburg-Hayes, I wanted to ask you--I'm very _x000D_
interested in the results of the CUNY ASAP program that you _x000D_
talked about that doubled the graduation rates for community _x000D_
college students that needed remediation. Can you talk just a _x000D_
little bit about the support services that were provided to the _x000D_
students and getting the impressive results from that program?"
2924406,2924405,2924407,19224,6,"    The support services were basically in _x000D_
four broad categories. The first was requirements and _x000D_
messaging. Students were invited to the program and told that _x000D_
they needed to enroll full-time, full-time being 12 credits._x000D_
    They were allowed to make up this full-time enrollment _x000D_
through the regular normal academic terms of fall and spring, _x000D_
as well as intersessions and summer enrollment. In totality, _x000D_
their intensity of enrollment was based on their accumulation _x000D_
of credits across an academic year and not just two semesters._x000D_
    In terms of student services, students received a _x000D_
comprehensive advisement from advisors. The advising ratio for _x000D_
the study that we performed was one advisor per 80 students. _x000D_
Students also were able to talk to career advisement._x000D_
    They also received automatic course enrollment with block _x000D_
scheduling available to some students, and students in limited _x000D_
majors were available for this program. For example, some _x000D_
majors, such as nursing--it's not possible to graduate in a _x000D_
very short period of time, given practicals and other _x000D_
requirements of the major._x000D_
    Finally, students were given financial support, including _x000D_
tuition gap coverage. All students were required to fill out _x000D_
the FAFSA and to apply for all aid for which they were _x000D_
eligible. If there should be unmet need for tuition and fees _x000D_
after that amount, the program covered that gap, in addition to _x000D_
incentivizing students through having a transportation voucher _x000D_
and providing use of free textbooks."
2924407,2924406,2924408,19224,6,"    Dr. Renick, what support services did you _x000D_
provide?"
2924408,2924407,2924409,19224,6,"    It makes sense when you say it. Absolutely._x000D_
    Mr. Jones and Dr. Ralls, I wanted to ask you--I said in my _x000D_
opening statement that it's really critical that we have the _x000D_
right data on student outcomes if we want to make sure we're _x000D_
targeting our intervention to really make sure we're _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    Dr. Ralls, you noted in your testimony that less than a _x000D_
third of the students in North Carolina community colleges are _x000D_
included in the current Federal completion data. Can both of _x000D_
you talk a little bit about how this data might help us better _x000D_
inform what policy we should be pursuing in terms of low-income _x000D_
and non-traditional students?"
2924409,2924408,2924410,19224,6,"    I'm out of time._x000D_
    Mr. Jones, if you can just be concise."
2924410,2924409,2924411,19224,6,"    The obvious one is called grant graduation _x000D_
rates. Why the Federal Government wouldn't collect data on _x000D_
whether Pell students graduate is beyond my comprehension. But _x000D_
they don't. They don't--also, there's been this back and forth _x000D_
about whether we graduate veterans or not. That's pretty _x000D_
obvious. We should know that, too._x000D_
    They don't collect data on remediation, which both of you _x000D_
have remarked. That's pretty obvious, too. The metrics we use _x000D_
have been adopted by the National Governors Association back _x000D_
when Senator Manchin was Governor Manchin and started that _x000D_
initiative._x000D_
    There's a key set of small, disaggregated metrics that are _x000D_
important to college. As Senator Alexander pointed to, these _x000D_
things send signals across the whole U.S. colleges and _x000D_
universities."
2924411,2924410,2924412,19224,6,    Thank you.
2924412,2924411,2924413,19224,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Collins._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Collins"
2924413,2924412,2924414,19224,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    My concern is focused on those students who end up in debt _x000D_
and with no degree. That's the worst possible combination. Yet _x000D_
when I hear about the low completion rates, we have a whole _x000D_
category of people in that situation. We also know that if _x000D_
students don't graduate that they are three times more likely _x000D_
to default on their student loan debt._x000D_
    I want to describe a program that is going on at a college _x000D_
in Maine and get your reaction to it, but also run by you a _x000D_
suggestion that has been made to me by the director of that _x000D_
program._x000D_
    Eastern Maine Community College has a student success _x000D_
center, and it has two main components. First, for incoming _x000D_
students, it has an intensive 2-week remedial course in _x000D_
mathematics and writing. That has helped improve their _x000D_
retention rate, just that 2-week intensive course right at the _x000D_
start._x000D_
    Second, for ongoing purposes, there is a student success _x000D_
center where students can come for peer mentoring, for _x000D_
tutoring, for counseling, for small grants that may help them _x000D_
out if they're having childcare problems or transportation _x000D_
problems. It looks at the whole person and what the barriers to _x000D_
completion are, and that, too, combined with the academic _x000D_
advising, has increased retention rates._x000D_
    The director of the center has suggested to me--given the _x000D_
high default rate of students who don't complete college and _x000D_
given the fact that we know that if they do complete college, _x000D_
they are going to have lifetime earnings that are a million _x000D_
dollars higher than someone with just a high school diploma--_x000D_
that if we had some sort of incentive in the form of very small _x000D_
loan forgiveness, that it would help provide the incentive that _x000D_
students need to complete college._x000D_
    I'd like to get your reaction to that idea. Why don't we _x000D_
just start and go across the panel with Mr. Jones?"
2924414,2924413,2924415,19224,6,"    I want to pick up on your point about the short _x000D_
remediation right before classes start and Senator Alexander's _x000D_
example of Austin Peay, where they connect a class with _x000D_
remediation support. Tennessee is now going to do that _x000D_
statewide starting in the fall._x000D_
    Georgia has a different model that they're doing statewide _x000D_
starting this fall, as is West Virginia. They're doubling the _x000D_
success rates in English. They're quadrupling the success rates _x000D_
in math._x000D_
    You provide in the Pell program money that is used for _x000D_
remediation. You could strengthen that by encouraging that _x000D_
money to be used in programs like you suggested in Maine, in _x000D_
that fashion, or programs they're doing in Georgia or they're _x000D_
doing in Tennessee, and you'll get more bang for your buck, _x000D_
more success, than traditional remedial programs that are _x000D_
unconnected."

2924418,2924417,2924419,19224,6,"    I'm trained by nature to be skeptical. _x000D_
With that said, the program sounds very interesting. A lot of _x000D_
the components seem to be based on research. There's some _x000D_
support for individual components._x000D_
    Yet I would be concerned that this program is not _x000D_
necessarily one that could fit all. As we said here, there's _x000D_
targeting that needs to be involved and some reflection of what _x000D_
student supports are needed for different types of students._x000D_
    In addition, it seems that the engagement nature of this _x000D_
program would be something that would need to be shored up in _x000D_
order to make sure that the students who needed it most were _x000D_
the ones who were actually participating in the student success _x000D_
centers. We've actually done random assignment evaluations of _x000D_
student success centers, and they work when students attend._x000D_
    I would also say that in terms of the solution of providing _x000D_
loan forgiveness, there has been some rigorous research that _x000D_
suggests that when you have a loan forgiveness program, you can _x000D_
generate the desirable outcomes that you'd want. The structure _x000D_
of such programs really matter. Pulling in behavioral concepts _x000D_
and being very privy to the incentive structures in place is _x000D_
very important._x000D_
    I would just say that these are the types of ideas that _x000D_
really warrant themselves to be studied in order to determine _x000D_
unintended consequences before they're scaled up and required _x000D_
and mandated as a policy."
2924419,2924418,2924420,19224,6,    Thank you.
2924420,2924419,2924421,19224,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Murphy._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Murphy"
2924421,2924420,2924422,19224,6,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Almost without exception schools are making decisions about _x000D_
programs based on what's best for students. I guess I don't _x000D_
think that schools can completely ignore, at least at a _x000D_
subconscious level, the financial incentives that dictate what _x000D_
you invest in and what you don't invest in._x000D_
    Right now, when it comes to Federal support for colleges, _x000D_
the only thing that gets you in trouble is a massive default _x000D_
rate that puts you on the far edge of your cohort. There's _x000D_
nothing that provides a financial incentive for schools, for _x000D_
instance, to graduate more kids on time or to invest in these _x000D_
kinds of supports for remedial course work. In fact, you can _x000D_
argue that there's actually a financial incentive not to invest _x000D_
in those things. I don't think that prevents schools from doing _x000D_
it._x000D_
    Mr. Jones, I'll ask the question to you. Don't you think it _x000D_
would make sense for us to try to rework the way in which we _x000D_
send billions of dollars to schools through the Pell grant _x000D_
program and the Stafford program such that we provide at least _x000D_
a small financial incentive for schools to invest in all these _x000D_
programs? It might actually be a way of addressing this _x000D_
legitimate concern that many have about being overly _x000D_
prescriptive._x000D_
    If we just simply used all of the money we send to schools _x000D_
to expect them to do a little bit better and left it up to them _x000D_
to follow the evidence where it led them, wouldn't that get us _x000D_
a little bit faster to where we want to go?"
2924422,2924421,2924423,19224,6,"    I think that's exactly right. When we started 6 _x000D_
years ago, there were only three States in the country--_x000D_
Washington was one of them, Indiana was one of them, Ohio--that _x000D_
had performance funding. There are 15 States. We're quickly _x000D_
going to 30 States. My projection in 10 years is we'll be at 40 _x000D_
to 45 States that will have their own performance funding._x000D_
    What you also can do in providing incentives is provide _x000D_
incentives to graduate more low-income students, like Pell _x000D_
students, or incentives to get students through remediation in _x000D_
a more timely way, or incentives to graduate students on time. _x000D_
Between, as you pointed out, all the other Federal grant _x000D_
programs that you have as well as the Pell program, it would be _x000D_
very powerful._x000D_
    It doesn't take much money to put on the table--no _x000D_
disrespect to the former president of the University of _x000D_
Tennessee--to get presidents interested in changing their ways. _x000D_
Put a little money on the table in the right direction."
2924423,2924422,2924424,19224,6,"    Dr. Renick, I was so impressed with the _x000D_
focus you've had on bringing in low-income students. Do you _x000D_
think there's a way to do this, to build an accountability _x000D_
system that doesn't discourage schools from reaching out and _x000D_
taking in at-risk students? That's often the critique of these _x000D_
accountability systems, that you're going to make it less _x000D_
likely that you have low-income, at-risk students coming _x000D_
through the door, as if you get punished for, for instance, _x000D_
longer graduation times._x000D_
    Is there a way to do this that risk adjusts for schools _x000D_
that are reaching out to these student populations?"
2924424,2924423,2924425,19224,6,"    I just think there's a way to take the _x000D_
billions of dollars that we're using and incentivize the kinds _x000D_
of programs we're talking about today in a way that's not _x000D_
prescriptive and also in a way that's not overly punitive, _x000D_
suggesting, for instance, that the outlier schools, the schools _x000D_
that really have the worst retention rates, may for a period of _x000D_
time have a portion of their Federal aid compromised._x000D_
    We've had separate hearings on this topic. I hope it's _x000D_
something that we entertain as we move forward with the _x000D_
consideration of the reauthorization._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924425,2924424,2924426,19224,6,"    Thank you, Senator Murphy._x000D_
    Senator Cassidy._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Cassidy"
2924426,2924425,2924427,19224,6,"    Many institutions calculate those rates _x000D_
on their own using their internal institutional research _x000D_
departments to do so, because they need it for institutional _x000D_
decisionmaking. Whether you as a committee could demand that _x000D_
those studies come up--I don't think that there is a way in _x000D_
terms of a short timeframe from a research perspective."
2924427,2924426,2924428,19224,6,"    We collect data from 30 States, including _x000D_
Tennessee. They all collect data on Pell student graduation _x000D_
rates. Most every institution does collect it."
2924428,2924427,2924429,19224,6,"    I don't know. It's not available to the general _x000D_
public, to researchers. More importantly, the policymakers--I _x000D_
honestly think a letter from this committee to the secretary of _x000D_
education would be the fastest----"
2924429,2924428,2924430,19224,6,"    Most institutions have that information. They _x000D_
don't publish it."
2924430,2924429,2924431,19224,6,"    Thank you, Senator Cassidy._x000D_
    Senator Baldwin._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Baldwin"
2924431,2924430,2924432,19224,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to be _x000D_
a part of the discussion today. It's very enlightening. One of _x000D_
the things that we still use as terminology is the phrase, _x000D_
nontraditional students, and yet we find that the majority of _x000D_
students today are what we used to call nontraditional _x000D_
students. We've got to ultimately probably change that _x000D_
nomenclature._x000D_
    It provides us with some real challenges in terms of making _x000D_
sure that we have the policies that increase the chance of _x000D_
these students completing their degrees or certificates on time _x000D_
with little or, certainly, a lot less debt, but also avoid _x000D_
implementing punitive measures that would serve to impede their _x000D_
success._x000D_
    In July of this year, I was proud to introduce, along with _x000D_
13 of my colleagues in the Senate and Congressman Bobby Scott _x000D_
in the House, a bill called the America's College Promise Act. _x000D_
The bill creates a new Federal-State partnership that would _x000D_
waive tuition and fees at community colleges, with States _x000D_
contributing $1 for every $3 of the Federal investment._x000D_
    It's a first dollar program, meaning students can use their _x000D_
Pell grants and other financial aid to cover the many financial _x000D_
demands of obtaining a higher education outside of tuition and _x000D_
fees. I've been very interested in the questions that have been _x000D_
posed and the discussion that we've been having today, because _x000D_
when you start debate on a new idea, we don't need to repeat _x000D_
the mistakes of the past. We can incorporate what seems to be _x000D_
working._x000D_
    America's College Promise doesn't just require States to _x000D_
invest financially. It asks them to make reforms, reforms like _x000D_
we've been talking about--expanding student supportive _x000D_
services, improving remediation, stressing career pathways--and _x000D_
these reforms, we hope, will help the students complete their _x000D_
course work and be prepared._x000D_
    What I want to ask is for you to perhaps weigh in a little _x000D_
further on this. We have a choice of making this prescriptive _x000D_
and mandatory or providing a menu and requiring these reforms _x000D_
be adopted as appropriate so it's not a one-size-fits-all. If _x000D_
we're going to get it right from the beginning, as we initiate _x000D_
this debate on covering the first 2 years of community or _x000D_
technical college, I want to hear where you see that balance._x000D_
    I want to start with Mr. Ralls, but I certainly would _x000D_
welcome all of your comments on this."
2924432,2924431,2924433,19224,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Jones."
2924433,2924432,2924434,19224,6,"    I've spent most of my life pushing _x000D_
affordability. I would couple that with what you said--reform. _x000D_
We have a lot of people going to college--the highest ever in _x000D_
the recession, but we don't have the reform necessary._x000D_
    I would make it a menu. Whether it's the Austin Peay model _x000D_
for remediation, or some of the models that Tim has done at _x000D_
Georgia State, or a model like the Tennessee Tech Center that _x000D_
has a 75 percent completion rate and an 80 percent placement _x000D_
rate, I would make it models or menus where there's evidence _x000D_
that they actually succeed in delivering, not just simply a _x000D_
menu--you could do this or you could do this--but menus where _x000D_
there's evidence of success. There is plenty of evidence out _x000D_
there where colleges like Georgia State and Austin Peay have _x000D_
done this very successfully."
2924434,2924433,2924435,19224,6,"    Any other comments?_x000D_
    Dr. Renick?"
2924435,2924434,2924436,19224,6,    Dr. Richburg-Hayes.
2924436,2924435,2924437,19224,6,"    I would just add that programs really _x000D_
need to be targeted so that a menu is very important. It's _x000D_
unlikely that any one of the programs that we talked about _x000D_
today that are evidence-based strategies will be applicable to _x000D_
all institutions and to all students. It will be really _x000D_
important to give institutions the time and resources in order _x000D_
to develop programs that will work._x000D_
    Georgia State University is a great example. It took them a _x000D_
decade to get where they are, and it's important for us to _x000D_
remember that. These changes do not happen immediately and _x000D_
overnight."
2924437,2924436,2924438,19224,6,    Thank you.
2924438,2924437,2924439,19224,6,"    Senator Bennet._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Bennet"
2924439,2924438,2924440,19224,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for _x000D_
holding this hearing and for reminding us to be cautious about _x000D_
one-size-fits-all. As I listened to the testimony today, I'm _x000D_
reminded again that policy is one thing and implementation is _x000D_
something else. You can have the best policy in the world and _x000D_
terrible implementation, and you don't get the results that you _x000D_
need._x000D_
    We compound that problem by also measuring the wrong _x000D_
things. We're asking the wrong questions. Dr. Renick pointed _x000D_
out that this gainful employment stuff has really made it _x000D_
difficult for a number of our institutions, because the _x000D_
correlation on income is actually what your family's income _x000D_
looked like, not what the institution you went to looked like, _x000D_
but we decided that would be a good way to measure outcomes. _x000D_
There's a lot of work for us to do, a lot of thoughtful work _x000D_
for us to pay attention to._x000D_
    I wanted to spend my time with you, Dr. Renick, today. _x000D_
Georgia State has done some incredible things--amazing _x000D_
accomplishments. I wonder if you could describe what the GPS _x000D_
program looks like from the student's perspective. How do I _x000D_
know, if I'm a student at Georgia State, that I'm at Georgia _x000D_
State instead of someplace else, that my experience would be _x000D_
different?"
2924440,2924439,2924441,19224,6,"    It's not--you're measuring, you say, in the _x000D_
top 30,000 students, 800 factors. From the student's _x000D_
perspective, what does that look like?"
2924441,2924440,2924442,19224,6,"    Tell me what those kinds of mistakes would _x000D_
be, away from the map, that you could detect, and how you reach _x000D_
out to the student."
2924442,2924441,2924443,19224,6,"    I was also struck by something you talked _x000D_
about in terms of how we measure success for institutions and _x000D_
for students. We've just, with the Chairman's leadership, _x000D_
managed to pass a reauthorization of what used to be called No _x000D_
Child Left Behind, which for a long, long time measured the _x000D_
wrong thing. It said, ``These are successful schools because _x000D_
the kids are at a high status, and these are failing schools.''_x000D_
    Even though these kids might not be growing, and these kids _x000D_
were actually growing while they're there, we were telling the _x000D_
world that these schools where the teachers were actually _x000D_
driving success and growth were failures. One of the things you _x000D_
said was that we ought to reward students and institutions who _x000D_
are making a difference against the odds. That is the right way _x000D_
to think about it. How do we do that?"
2924443,2924442,2924444,19224,6,"    I'm out of time. If you don't mind, I'll _x000D_
followup with you after the panel to get your list."
2924444,2924443,2924445,19224,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Warren"
2924446,2924445,2924447,19224,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all _x000D_
for being here today._x000D_
    We all know that helping students should be a high _x000D_
priority, and I know that you all see this. I've read your _x000D_
testimony, and you've provided a lot of good information about _x000D_
programs that colleges can adopt to improve student outcomes. _x000D_
Only a few colleges are showing any real leadership in this _x000D_
area. I want to focus on Federal policies that can push schools _x000D_
harder in that direction._x000D_
    Mr. Jones, could I start with you? Your organization works _x000D_
with schools and States to help improve outcomes for students. _x000D_
In your opinion, do colleges have enough incentives to improve _x000D_
student success?"
2924447,2924446,2924448,19224,6,"    They don't. Typically, the old incentive was _x000D_
what we call the 10-day or the 14-day count. You got your money _x000D_
based on whether you were there on the 10th day. If you weren't _x000D_
there on the 11th day, it didn't make any difference. States _x000D_
have moved rather rapidly to change that._x000D_
    The Federal Government is very powerful in the money that _x000D_
you provide, both in the Pell money, but other grant programs _x000D_
that you provide. Providing incentives to graduate more _x000D_
students, graduate them in a more timely way, because they'll _x000D_
incur less debt, get them through remediation into the credit-_x000D_
bearing classes--those are all incentives that you could easily _x000D_
do and put in programs."
2924448,2924447,2924449,19224,6,"    Good. I just want to underline what I'm _x000D_
hearing you say about this is putting financial incentives in _x000D_
place so that schools have a reason to invest not just in _x000D_
getting students in through the door, but in having them _x000D_
succeed._x000D_
    When we talk about improving student success, we aren't _x000D_
just talking about getting students through a graduation _x000D_
ceremony--getting them in the row and walking them across the _x000D_
stage. We're talking about making sure that students leave _x000D_
college with an education that helps them succeed._x000D_
    I wanted to turn to you on this, Mr. Renick. Which colleges _x000D_
are doing a better or worse job at making sure that students _x000D_
are prepared for good jobs after they graduate?"
2924449,2924448,2924450,19224,6,"    Let me just stop you there, though, Mr. _x000D_
Renick. I very much hear your point about helping students find _x000D_
out what career paths may be most informative for them._x000D_
    I particularly want to focus on--I heard you say, earlier _x000D_
or know that you referred to predatory institutions, that we're _x000D_
not just talking about how we get more students to study things _x000D_
that are going to be useful. It's about whole institutions and _x000D_
where institutions are focused. Do you want to say just a word _x000D_
about that?"
2924450,2924449,2924451,19224,6,"    So $100,000 in debt and very little credit _x000D_
that will actually transfer. For-profit colleges seem more _x000D_
interested in shareholder success than in student success. _x000D_
About one in five students who borrow to attend a for-profit _x000D_
college default on their loans within 3 years of leaving _x000D_
school. That means, on average, that for-profit colleges are _x000D_
failing at least one in five of their students. Let me just see _x000D_
if I can wrap this up really quickly with a note here._x000D_
    Mr. Jones, what kinds of policies would give for-profit _x000D_
colleges an incentive to improve outcomes for their students?"
2924451,2924450,2924452,19224,6,"    You should look at the creditors. You authorize _x000D_
the creditors. Right now, it's all about resources for _x000D_
colleges, but it ought to be about outcomes, both in terms of _x000D_
completion rates and on-time completion rates. Do they get _x000D_
jobs? What kind of debt ratios do they serve?_x000D_
    The creditors, have been very lax at looking at any of _x000D_
those factors in terms of re-accrediting schools. I can't _x000D_
imagine the ones they've accredited just can't meet those--_x000D_
having met those standards. I'd look to the creditors and how _x000D_
they do this and rewrite that."
2924452,2924451,2924453,19224,6,    Good. I'll just put this in----
2924453,2924452,2924454,19224,6,    For both private and public.
2924454,2924453,2924455,19224,6,"    Thank you. I'll put this in as a question _x000D_
for the record for everyone here._x000D_
    We just have to go back to the fact that the Federal _x000D_
Government is shelling out $150 billion every year to help _x000D_
students attend college. Some schools are doing their part to _x000D_
make sure that those dollars are well-spent. Some are not. As _x000D_
we work on the Higher Education Act, it is critical to focus on _x000D_
whether all colleges that dip into that $150 billion have the _x000D_
right incentives to invest in the success of their students._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2924455,2924454,2924456,19224,6,"    Thank you, Senator Warren._x000D_
    Senator Murray, do you have any further thoughts?"
2924456,2924455,2924457,19224,6,"    I do not. I just want to thank our _x000D_
panelists today for a really important discussion._x000D_
    As we move forward to work to reauthorize the Higher _x000D_
Education Act, you've given us a lot to ponder and think about. _x000D_
At the end of the day, we want to make sure that all young _x000D_
people today and adults from all walks of life have access, and _x000D_
this has been an important part of that discussion. Thank you."
2924457,2924456,2924458,19224,6,"    This has been a very helpful hearing and a _x000D_
reminder about how big and complex and diverse our system of _x000D_
higher education is. It makes me think, with all these really _x000D_
good ideas, 75 percent, 76 percent of our students go to public _x000D_
2-year schools, 4-year schools, and they have legislators and _x000D_
Governors and Higher Education Commission members and _x000D_
university presidents and board of trustees all rushing around _x000D_
to meet with one another to find out what North Carolina is _x000D_
doing._x000D_
    I know I used to--when I was Governor, I'd go see Bill _x000D_
Friday, and I'd try to learn everything I could about North _x000D_
Carolina's higher education system. I'm sure that Dr. Renick _x000D_
has seen a great many of our other institutions work to adopt _x000D_
his progress._x000D_
    Senator Warren is right. We spend a lot of money here, and _x000D_
we have a chance here in the next few months to make sure we _x000D_
spend it wisely to create an environment in which you can do _x000D_
more of what you're doing without imposing on you what might be _x000D_
a very good idea that works here but doesn't necessarily work _x000D_
there and not to tar you with predatory practices that might _x000D_
exist in other places._x000D_
    As you followup this hearing, if you have thoughts that _x000D_
you'd like to suggest to us about ways to adjust our system of _x000D_
financial aid so that we can encourage the kind of student _x000D_
success that so many States have been adopting over the last _x000D_
few years really on their own, if there's an appropriate way _x000D_
for us to do that, we certainly ought to consider it. If there _x000D_
are things that you think we should definitely not do that _x000D_
would get in the way of letting that happen, I'd like to hear _x000D_
that as well._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 10 days to submit _x000D_
additional comments and any questions for the record that _x000D_
Senators may have. We plan to hold the next HELP hearing in _x000D_
September._x000D_
    Thank you for being here today. The committee will stand _x000D_
adjourned."
2924458,2924457,2924459,19228,1,"    The Senate Committee on Health, Education, _x000D_
Labor, and Pensions will come to order._x000D_
    Good morning. Today's hearing marks the committee's seventh _x000D_
of this Congress on the reauthorization of the Higher Education _x000D_
Act. This morning, we will be discussing sexual assault on _x000D_
college campuses and legislative proposals aimed at lessening _x000D_
this crime and providing justice for the survivors and alleged _x000D_
perpetrators._x000D_
    Before we begin, I would like to share a brief statement _x000D_
from Chairman Lamar Alexander, who asked me to read the _x000D_
following:_x000D_
_x000D_
          ``I've asked Senator Collins to chair today's hearing _x000D_
        because I have had to go to Nashville for the funeral _x000D_
        of a close friend. Before she was elected to the _x000D_
        Senate, Senator Collins worked at Husson University in _x000D_
        Bangor, ME, so she brings a valuable perspective to _x000D_
        this discussion.''_x000D_
_x000D_
    Oh, it's weird to be reading what someone else is saying _x000D_
about you."
2924459,2924458,2924460,19228,3,"    Thank you, Senator Murray._x000D_
    I'm now very pleased to welcome our colleagues as the first _x000D_
panel of witnesses today. Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill has _x000D_
a long history of fighting sexual violence, going back to when _x000D_
she prosecuted sex crimes and established a Domestic Violence _x000D_
Unit in the Kansas City region, and leading to her current work _x000D_
in the Senate to curb sexual assaults in the military and on _x000D_
college campuses. She is the lead on the Campus Accountability _x000D_
and Safety Act._x000D_
    Nevada Senator Dean Heller has been an advocate for sexual _x000D_
assault survivors since his tenure in the House of _x000D_
Representatives, where he led a bipartisan effort to reduce the _x000D_
rape backlog and to help bring closure to victims and families _x000D_
of this horrendous crime._x000D_
    New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been a key voice on _x000D_
the issue of sexual assault on college campuses and also in the _x000D_
military, particularly in her role on the Senate Armed Services _x000D_
Committee._x000D_
    And New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, drawing on her _x000D_
experience as New Hampshire's chief prosecutor and former _x000D_
attorney general, has also worked hard in the Senate to stop _x000D_
sexual assault and domestic violence._x000D_
    Thank you all for being here today, and we'll start with _x000D_
Senator McCaskill._x000D_
_x000D_
                     Statement of Senator McCaskill"
2924460,2924459,2924461,19228,3,"    Senator Heller._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Heller"
2924461,2924460,2924462,19228,4,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Gillibrand._x000D_
_x000D_
                    Statement of Senator Gillibrand"
2924462,2924461,2924463,19228,4,"    Thank you for your testimony, and those _x000D_
letters will be entered into the record without objection._x000D_
    Senator Ayotte._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Ayotte"
2924463,2924462,2924464,19228,4,"    Thank you very much. I want to thank all _x000D_
four of our colleagues for coming to testify today and for your _x000D_
outstanding leadership on this issue. I know you have busy _x000D_
schedules, so at this point, you're free to go, and we'll bring _x000D_
forward the second panel._x000D_
    I am pleased to welcome our next panel of four witnesses _x000D_
today. Our first witness, president Janet Napolitano, is the _x000D_
president of the University of California. I had the pleasure _x000D_
of working with president Napolitano when she was Secretary of _x000D_
Homeland Security and I served as ranking member of the Senate _x000D_
Homeland Security Committee. It's a pleasure to welcome her _x000D_
back to Washington today._x000D_
    President Napolitano leads a university system with 10 _x000D_
campuses, five medical centers, three affiliated national labs, _x000D_
and a statewide agricultural and natural resources program. _x000D_
Previously, she served as Governor and attorney general--not at _x000D_
the same time, I might add--of Arizona._x000D_
    Our second witness, Dana Bolger, is the co-founder of Know _x000D_
Your IX. She leads a national survivor and youth-led campaign _x000D_
to end campus sexual and dating violence. She is also a _x000D_
columnist and a 2014 graduate of Amherst College._x000D_
    We thank you for being here as well._x000D_
    Next we will hear from Dolores Stafford, who is the _x000D_
executive director of the National Association of Clery _x000D_
Compliance Officers and Professionals and the Association for _x000D_
Campus Administrators who are responsible for managing Clery _x000D_
Act compliance. She also serves as the president and CEO of D. _x000D_
Stafford and Associates, a professional services firm _x000D_
specializing in safety and security-related issues on college _x000D_
campuses. It's also interesting to note that she served as _x000D_
chief of police at George Washington University for several _x000D_
years right here in Washington._x000D_
    And, finally, we will hear from Benz-Flounlacker, who is _x000D_
the associate vice president for Federal Relations at the _x000D_
Association of American Universities, where she has worked for _x000D_
some 14 years. She's responsible for higher education policy _x000D_
and funding issues._x000D_
    Governor Napolitano, we will begin with you."
2924464,2924463,2924465,19228,5,"    Thank you very much for your excellent _x000D_
testimony._x000D_

STATEMENT OF DANA BOLGER, CO-FOUNDER, KNOW YOUR IX, WASHINGTON, _x000D_
                               DC"
2924465,2924464,2924466,19228,6,"    Thank you so much, Ms. Bolger, for your _x000D_
testimony. It's so important that we put a human face on this _x000D_
problem, as I told you before the hearing, and that is what you _x000D_
have done today. I so admire that you turned your horrendous _x000D_
experience into advocacy so that others don't go through what _x000D_
you did. Thank you for being here today. It is appreciated._x000D_

  ASSOCIATION OF CLERY COMPLIANCE OFFICERS AND PROFESSIONALS; _x000D_

_x000D_
STATEMENT OF MOLLIE BENZ-FLOUNLACKER, ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT _x000D_
 FOR FEDERAL RELATIONS, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES, _x000D_
                         WASHINGTON, DC"
2924467,2924466,2924468,19228,8,"    Thank you very much for your testimony._x000D_
    We have just been notified that votes have started. We're _x000D_
going to have two votes, and we'll have a recess while we vote. _x000D_
We will be able to continue for now and get through some _x000D_
questions before people have to leave to vote. We'll limit _x000D_
Senators to 5 minutes on this round._x000D_
    I do also want to announce that Senator Alexander will be _x000D_
returning, and after the votes he will take over as chairman. _x000D_
It's been a great experience, and I would have liked to have _x000D_
continued, but I will turn over the gavel, albeit reluctantly, _x000D_
to the legitimate chairman of the committee._x000D_
    Ms. Flounlacker, I want to pick up on a point that you _x000D_
commented on about the confidential advisor. I'm a strong _x000D_
supporter of the confidential advisor. I've been surprised when _x000D_
I've talked to the University of Maine and other colleges that _x000D_
it turns out that this is not as straightforward as I thought _x000D_
that it would be._x000D_
    On the one hand, confidentiality really focuses on the _x000D_
victim, and that's what we should do, and it may encourage _x000D_
student victims to report violations and seek the help that _x000D_
they need. On the other hand, the requirements of Title IX and _x000D_
the Clery Act require various forms of reporting when crimes _x000D_
occur on campus. Indeed, the Department of Education's 2014 _x000D_
guidance says that, ``There are situations in which a school _x000D_
must override a student's request for confidentiality in order _x000D_
to meet its title IX obligations.''_x000D_
    It seems to me we're putting schools between a rock and a _x000D_
hard place unless we give some clarity here. How can colleges _x000D_
and universities provide the confidential services and advising _x000D_
that many of us think are vital to students while balancing and _x000D_
meeting the requirements of both Federal and, in some cases, _x000D_
State law and the desire to respond effectively?"
2924468,2924467,2924469,19228,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I'm going to ask the rest of you to respond for the record _x000D_
to that issue, because there is a clear conflict between the _x000D_
rules and the regulations._x000D_
    I want to get quickly to a second topic in my remaining _x000D_
time._x000D_
    Ms. Bolger, we have climate surveys that our military _x000D_
academies do, and they have a very high response rate because _x000D_
the students know that they are expected to fill out those _x000D_
climate surveys. That is not necessarily the case for private _x000D_
colleges and public universities._x000D_
    What suggestions would you have to encourage students to _x000D_
participate in the climate surveys so that they're meaningful?"
2924469,2924468,2924470,19228,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Murray."
2924470,2924469,2924471,19228,8,"    Senator Cassidy._x000D_

                      Statement of Senator Cassidy"
2924471,2924470,2924472,19228,10,"    Senator Warren._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Warren"
2924472,2924471,2924473,19228,10,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Baldwin._x000D_
_x000D_
                      Statement of Senator Baldwin"
2924473,2924472,2924474,19228,10,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Casey, you missed me lauding you in my opening _x000D_
statement, so know that it occurred._x000D_
_x000D_
                       Statement of Senator Casey"
2924474,2924473,2924475,19228,10,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It was _x000D_
an honor to substitute for you today. Thank you."
2924475,2924474,2924476,19228,10,"    Senator Murray, do you have additional _x000D_
questions and comments?"
2924476,2924475,2924477,19228,10,"    Thank you, Senator Murray. I should add that _x000D_
this has been a priority of Senator Murray's from the day we _x000D_
started working together, and she's going to continue to focus _x000D_
on campus safety. We're thinking about a hearing coming up soon _x000D_
on that._x000D_
    I have three questions I'd like to ask the panel, and the _x000D_
answers can come later. If you have something you'd like to say _x000D_
about it now, I'd welcome it._x000D_
    Question No. 1 goes back to what I said a little earlier. _x000D_
Government has a way of expressing its concern in laws, rules, _x000D_
and regulations that aren't as efficient as the concern is _x000D_
real. In other words, we sometimes duplicate, and we sometimes _x000D_
cause campuses to spend more time filling out forms than _x000D_
working with students to, for example, have a session informing _x000D_
incoming freshmen about what their responsibilities are._x000D_
    Let me ask this. Would each of you be willing to give us _x000D_
specific suggestions about how you see title IX and its rules _x000D_
and regulations, the Clery Act and the new regulations--how _x000D_
they could be improved, where they conflict, how they could be _x000D_
made clearer so that campuses would have the flexibility that _x000D_
you talked about, President Napolitano? I didn't know quite _x000D_
what title to give you, but I'll call you President Napolitano._x000D_
    Would you be willing to do that and to give it to us in as _x000D_
specific form as you could? If you have any comment you'd like _x000D_
to make about that, I'd be glad to have that."
2924477,2924476,2924478,19228,10,"    The University of California--I know that _x000D_
through your system, you're so large and such a good system _x000D_
that, you're bound to have plenty of people who are wading _x000D_
through all the Federal rules and regulations._x000D_
    Just tell us, ``We don't know what this means, and this _x000D_
duplicates this.'' You've been in so many different positions, _x000D_
as Governor and here--you know exactly what I'm talking about, _x000D_
particularly, on behalf of all the colleges and universities. _x000D_
We need that by around September in order to be able to include _x000D_
it in the reauthorization act if there's something that we need _x000D_
to do."
2924478,2924477,2924479,19228,10,    Yes.
2924479,2924478,2924480,19228,10,"    That's a reasonable request. Several of us on _x000D_
the committee asked a distinguished group headed by the _x000D_
chancellors of Maryland and Vanderbilt to look at, generally, _x000D_
simplifying our education rules and regulations and making them _x000D_
more effective._x000D_
    One of their findings was that every one of our 6,000 _x000D_
colleges and universities gets, on average, every work day, one _x000D_
new guidance or rule. I will ask the department not to do that, _x000D_
especially while we're in the midst of the reauthorization of _x000D_
the Higher Education Act._x000D_
    The other observation to make as a part of that is that _x000D_
only 15 percent of the colleges are private universities. We _x000D_
often think about those. There's a difference between Nashville _x000D_
Auto Diesel College and UCLA in terms of what we might be _x000D_
thinking about doing. We need to keep that diversity in mind._x000D_
    A second question I would ask you--one college president, a _x000D_
very accomplished one--she's been president of three different _x000D_
colleges--when I asked her what we should do about this, she _x000D_
said,_x000D_
_x000D_
          ``You should focus on helping campuses better _x000D_
        coordinate with law enforcement agencies, but do not _x000D_
        turn colleges into law enforcement agencies.''_x000D_
_x000D_
    Do you have any comment on that?_x000D_
    Ms. Stafford, I would think you might."
2924480,2924479,2924481,19228,10,"    The last question I would have is this. What _x000D_
can we do or not do to make sure that colleges establish _x000D_
procedures dealing with sexual assault that are fair and _x000D_
protect the due process rights of both the accused and the _x000D_
accuser? What should we keep in mind as we work on that issue?"
2924481,2924480,2924482,19228,10,"    Right._x000D_
    Ms. Bolger."
2924482,2924481,2924483,19228,10,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Yes, ma'am?"
2924483,2924482,2924484,19228,10,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Whitehouse has slipped in under the wire. I'll call _x000D_
on him, and then we'll conclude the hearing._x000D_
    Senator Whitehouse._x000D_
_x000D_
                    Statement of Senator Whitehouse"
2924484,2924483,2924485,19228,10,"    Thank you, Senator Whitehouse._x000D_
    I'd like to ask consent to insert statements in the record _x000D_
from individuals and organizations interested in due process _x000D_
rights. We've received a number of comments on that, including _x000D_
from Judge Nancy Gertner at Harvard Law School; Janet Halley, _x000D_
Harvard Law School professor; and others."
2924485,2924484,2924486,19228,10,"    The hearing record will remain open for 10 _x000D_
days. Members may submit additional information for the record _x000D_
within that time if they would like._x000D_
    The committee plans to hold the next hearing related to the _x000D_
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act on Wednesday, _x000D_
August 5, to discuss the status of student success at American _x000D_
colleges and universities and how to improve it._x000D_
    Thank you to the witnesses for coming. We appreciate it _x000D_
very much. Some of you have come a long way, and we know that _x000D_
you have other things to do, and this has been a big help to _x000D_
us._x000D_
    I thank my colleagues. The committee will stand adjourned."
2924486,2924485,2924487,19228,10,    Sure.
2924487,2924486,2924488,19228,10,    Thank you. The committee is adjourned.
2924488,2924487,2924489,19235,1,"    This hearing of the Senate Homeland _x000D_
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will come to order._x000D_
    I want to first thank Senator Baldwin for making this a _x000D_
very nice bipartisan effort and getting us a little bit closer _x000D_
here."
2924489,2924488,2924490,19235,2,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for convening _x000D_
us here in our home State. I will also go through the formality _x000D_
of asking that my written opening statement be made a part of _x000D_
the record\1\ and follow your lead in speaking from the heart._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Baldwin appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 49._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    We had a chance to talk between our formal meetings, just _x000D_
about how this impacts everybody, sometimes very immediately in _x000D_
one's own family--sometimes coworkers, neighbors, and fellow _x000D_
congregants--just as it affects everyone across our State and _x000D_
affects everyone across our Nation and, regrettably, has not _x000D_
gotten the policy attention that it really has needed until _x000D_
recent years._x000D_
    I think part of that has to do with something we have _x000D_
struggled with as a nation over the years of stigmatizing _x000D_
issues and making it more difficult for individuals and family _x000D_
members to come forward and tell their stories, be vocal, be _x000D_
visible, but if we only realized we can solve problems when we _x000D_
do that._x000D_
    And so, I want to add my words to Senator Johnson's in _x000D_
thanking the witnesses who sit before us right now, and we will _x000D_
have a second panel, and I want to greatly thank the second _x000D_
panel of witnesses in advance for being leaders and helping us _x000D_
sort of charge right through that stigma._x000D_
    I do not want anybody here to feel sorry for us in terms of _x000D_
the jurisdiction of our Committees. So, I am going to actually _x000D_
speak a little bit beyond the jurisdiction of the Homeland _x000D_
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), because _x000D_
both Senator Johnson and I have the ability to serve on a _x000D_
couple of different Committees, and epidemics, crises, and _x000D_
tragedies do not fit neatly into necessarily one Committee's _x000D_
jurisdiction._x000D_
    And so, I want to just add that in terms of addiction, the _x000D_
supplier is not always a drug cartel many miles away. Sometimes _x000D_
it is a medicine cabinet that has been left with unused pills. _x000D_
And, sometimes it is a prescriber who has been trained and _x000D_
takes an oath to care for our health and well-being, but yet _x000D_
well-meaning, has overprescribed or is overrelying on _x000D_
prescription drugs._x000D_
    And, the pathway to the tragedy and epidemic that we are _x000D_
seeing right now, I guess I will say there is several pathways, _x000D_
and we, as policymakers at the Federal level, and we will be _x000D_
joined by some amazing leaders at the State level in our next _x000D_
panel, can not be limited just by this this committee's _x000D_
jurisdiction and not the other. We have to work together and _x000D_
put together comprehensive problems, because when, in 2014, _x000D_
28,000 Americans lost their lives to either prescription _x000D_
opiates or illegal opiates, such as heroin and fentanyl, it _x000D_
demands that we work together and form those solutions._x000D_
    Recently, the Senate took a really significant step forward _x000D_
with the passage of an act called the Comprehensive Addiction _x000D_
and Receovery Act (CARA), and I think it is going to be a _x000D_
policy step forward. Resources need to come too. Because all of _x000D_
the treatment programs in the world unfunded will not provide _x000D_
the care and support that people need to lick an addiction and _x000D_
to stay sober and to partake in lifelong recovery._x000D_
    And so, the Federal Government is a partner, one partner of _x000D_
many, that need to come together to solve this issue, to _x000D_
strengthen our communities, but that is what needs to be done._x000D_
    And again, thank you, Chairman Johnson, for convening us _x000D_
here, and I so look forward to hearing from our witnesses, _x000D_
putting a face on those unspeakable statistics, in terms of _x000D_
overdose deaths and people in need."
2924490,2924489,2924491,19235,2,"    Thank you, Senator Baldwin. It is the _x000D_
tradition of this Committee to swear in witnesses, so if you _x000D_
will all rise and raise your right hand._x000D_
    Do you swear the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God._x000D_
    Please be seated._x000D_
    Our first witness is James Bohn. Mr. Bohn is the Director _x000D_
of the Wisconsin High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), _x000D_
within the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), a _x000D_
position he has held since February 2015. Prior to this, Mr. _x000D_
Bohn worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), _x000D_
for almost 30 years, 15 on which was spent serving as a special _x000D_
agent in charge of the DEA Milwaukee District Office. Mr. Bohn._x000D_

   TESTIMONY OF JAMES F. BOHN,\1\ DIRECTOR, WISCONSIN HIDTA, _x000D_
             OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY"
2924491,2924490,2924492,19235,2,"    Chairman Johnson, Senator Baldwin, and _x000D_
distinguished Members of the Committee, it is my privilege to _x000D_
address you on behalf of the Executive Board of the Wisconsin _x000D_
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program concerning the _x000D_
statewide drug threat assessment of Wisconsin, and in _x000D_
particular, the HIDTA-designated region._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Bohn appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 53._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My name is James F. Bohn, and I have been the Director of _x000D_
the Wisconsin HIDTA since February 2015. The HIDTA-designated _x000D_
counties in Wisconsin incorporate approximately 46 percent of _x000D_
the State's population. The HIDTA program is designed to _x000D_
support and encourage Federal, State, local, and tribal law _x000D_
enforcement agencies to work together in task force situations _x000D_
to target identified drug threats in the local HIDTA-designated _x000D_
areas._x000D_
    Each year the Wisconsin HIDTA Investigative Support Center _x000D_
conducts a comprehensive assessment of the drug threats in our _x000D_
area to identify and prioritize any new and continuing trends _x000D_
or threats affecting Wisconsin._x000D_
    Wisconsin can best be described as a destination State for _x000D_
illegal drugs and drug activity. By ``destination'' state, I am _x000D_
referring to the fact that in most instances, once illegal _x000D_
drugs enter Wisconsin's borders, they are almost always going _x000D_
to be used and/or resold within the State._x000D_
    Wisconsin's proximity to the major source cities of Chicago _x000D_
and Minneapolis has a direct and significant impact on the _x000D_
presence of illegal drugs and drug activity in Wisconsin. _x000D_
Within Wisconsin, Milwaukee is considered a source area for _x000D_
illegal drugs for other parts of the State._x000D_
    Now, while Wisconsin is geographically located on the _x000D_
Northern border, our investigations and intelligence reports of _x000D_
any significant seizures being sourced by drug trafficking _x000D_
organizations on the Northern border from the Northern border, _x000D_
which are relatively few, confirm that their initial entry into _x000D_
this country occurred via some other Northern border location, _x000D_
such as Detroit or one of the more western States, or by _x000D_
shipped parcel, prior to making its way into Wisconsin._x000D_
    The Wisconsin HIDTA Drug Threat Assessment has consistently _x000D_
found that the vast majority of drugs entering Wisconsin are _x000D_
via passenger vehicle on one of the major highways intersecting _x000D_
the State._x000D_
    Preliminary indications of the 2016-17 Drug Threat _x000D_
Assessment are confirming some notable differences from last _x000D_
year's threat assessment. However, what is the same is that _x000D_
opioid abuse, including both heroin and prescription drug _x000D_
abuse, remain the number one drug threat in Wisconsin. And, _x000D_
while Wisconsin has historically experienced relatively low _x000D_
levels of methamphetamine (meth)-related activity, _x000D_
methamphetamine is now beginning to show a much greater _x000D_
presence all around the State as well._x000D_
    For years, most of the methamphetamine activity in _x000D_
Wisconsin was concentrated along the western portions of the _x000D_
State due to its proximity to Minneapolis. However, within the _x000D_
past year, much larger quantities of methamphetamine are _x000D_
showing up all around the State. Most of the seizures have been _x000D_
directly linked to groups out of Minneapolis and, at times, _x000D_
Chicago. Minneapolis continues to be a distribution center for _x000D_
large amounts of Mexican-produced methamphetamine coming _x000D_
directly from the southwest border by Mexican drug trafficking _x000D_
organizations bringing it into the Minneapolis area._x000D_
    Much of the heroin abuse in Wisconsin stems from users _x000D_
transitioning from prescription opioid drugs to heroin. Last _x000D_
year, 100 percent of the Wisconsin survey respondents listed _x000D_
heroin as their number one drug threat. For 2015, Milwaukee _x000D_
County alone reported 109 heroin-related overdose deaths, with _x000D_
the vast majority of the heroin in Wisconsin being sourced from _x000D_
Chicago-based traffickers with connections to the southwest _x000D_
border and Mexican cartels._x000D_
    Over the course of the past 2 to 3 years, the majority of _x000D_
heroin present in Wisconsin is one of the several types of high _x000D_
purity Mexican heroin, as opposed to the high purity South _x000D_
American heroin that was routinely seen for the decade or more _x000D_
prior to that._x000D_
    In addition, the growing heroin problem has led to _x000D_
increased violence and challenges for law enforcement, _x000D_
especially in the Milwaukee area, not only by the ever-_x000D_
increasing number of overdoses and deaths, but also due to _x000D_
changes in the retail distribution market._x000D_
    In Milwaukee, for example, mobile drug houses have become _x000D_
commonplace and have presented law enforcement with new and _x000D_
more dangerous challenges. These opportunistic traffickers _x000D_
travel around the city in stolen vehicles, usually with _x000D_
multiple violators and weapons inside the vehicle, posing an _x000D_
increased level of danger not only for law enforcement, but _x000D_
also to the public._x000D_
    Of growing concern during 2015 and continuing into 2016 is _x000D_
the increased presence of fentanyl. This most recent increase _x000D_
in fentanyl abuse appears to stem from the importation of _x000D_
fentanyl that is most likely clandestinely produced in Mexico _x000D_
and mixed in with quantities of heroin being smuggled into _x000D_
Wisconsin._x000D_
    In response to Wisconsin's identified drug threats, the _x000D_
Wisconsin HIDTA program uses a multi-faceted approach to _x000D_
address the identified threats and is committed to facilitating _x000D_
cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal law _x000D_
enforcement and prevention efforts through the sharing of _x000D_
intelligence, and by providing support to coordinated law _x000D_
enforcement efforts toward identified drug threats._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity, and I would be happy to _x000D_
answer any questions that you may have."
2924492,2924491,2924493,19235,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Bohn._x000D_
    Our next witness is Dr. Timothy Westlake. Dr. Westlake is _x000D_
the Vice Chairman of the State of Wisconsin Medical Examining _x000D_
Board and Chairman of the Controlled Substance Committee. Dr. _x000D_
Westlake also serves on numerous boards designed to combat _x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF TIM WESTLAKE,\1\ M."
2924493,2924492,2924494,19235,2,"    Thank you. I would like to take this time to _x000D_
thank Chairman Johnson and Senator Baldwin for holding this _x000D_
hearing. I am grateful for the opportunity to testify and share _x000D_
my experiences._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Westlake appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 61._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My name is Tim Westlake. I am a full-time emergency _x000D_
physician at Oconomowoc Memorial Hospital, and I have been _x000D_
practicing there for 15 years._x000D_
    In my role as an emergency physician, I have witnessed _x000D_
firsthand the evolution of this crisis. This past week alone, I _x000D_
treated two heroin overdoses. One of them survived, and one did _x000D_
not. I later found out that the patient we could not save was _x000D_
the fourth person from his high school class to die of an _x000D_
overdose._x000D_
    The coroner that slipped him into the body bag said he has _x000D_
recently been seeing on average two opioid overdose deaths per _x000D_
day taken down to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner._x000D_
    What can be said to comfort those who have lost a loved one _x000D_
in this way? Sometimes I feel like all I can do is sit there _x000D_
with the family and bear witness to the unimaginable pain and _x000D_
suffering that they experience._x000D_
    I wish I was making this next part up, but, while I was _x000D_
writing out the testimony, my wife received a text about the _x000D_
tragic news of another overdose death of a child in our area. _x000D_
He was at my daughter's high school last year. He took a single _x000D_
pill. How dangerous could one single pill be? It was very _x000D_
dangerous. It was a highly potent, long-acting opioid and _x000D_
suppressed his respiration so much, his heart stopped and he's _x000D_
brain-dead. And, I believe right now his organs are being _x000D_
harvested._x000D_
    And, tragedies like this play out every day once every 24 _x000D_
minutes in America, and it is truly the public health crisis of _x000D_
our time. But, there is hope. Awareness is increasing, and I _x000D_
applaud the efforts being made to address this issue._x000D_
    It is critical to remember that the lion's share of _x000D_
healthcare regulation occurs at the State and local level, and _x000D_
as such, most of the responsibility for addressing the _x000D_
prescription drug epidemic will come from the State's hospital _x000D_
systems and physicians themselves. The Federal Government has a _x000D_
limited, but useful, role, and there are small areas really _x000D_
only where that best solution involves Federal legislative _x000D_
change._x000D_
    The opioid crisis did not exist in epidemic proportions _x000D_
until the last 15 years. That was mainly due to a shift in the _x000D_
opioid prescriptive practices in the late 1990s. It was _x000D_
directly related to the premise that pain was being _x000D_
undertreated and that patients had a right to have their pain _x000D_
treated. And, people know this as the pain scale that we see _x000D_
every time you go into the doctor's office, several times _x000D_
usually._x000D_
    This originated with the Federal Government as a probably _x000D_
well-intentioned program through the Centers for Medicare and _x000D_
Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs, _x000D_
and then it quickly was reinforced by the Joint Commission on _x000D_
Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) and embedded _x000D_
into the culture of the practice of medicine. It is now _x000D_
embedded, literally, in every single doctor-patient _x000D_
relationship, and it has been and continues to be a driving, _x000D_
causative factor in overprescription that is occurring._x000D_
    Earlier this week, I was working a night shift and woke up _x000D_
and got an e-mail and text saying that I could not believe how _x000D_
excited I was that Senator Johnson's released a bill that will _x000D_
eliminate the pain scale, effectively. It is called the _x000D_
Pressure to Reduce Overprescribed Painkillers (PROP Act). It _x000D_
will make the Federal Government unable to tie medical _x000D_
reimbursement to pain outcome measures and will help take the _x000D_
government out of the doctor-patient relationship._x000D_
    It is already gained broad bipartisan support and backing _x000D_
from the medical community and recovery community._x000D_
    Senator Johnson, thank you. You really do not have an idea _x000D_
how much impact this will have in eliminating the pain scale. _x000D_
Perhaps as far as what you could do for regulation of _x000D_
prescribers, it is the single-most important piece of Federal _x000D_
legislative reform that you could do. It is very important._x000D_
    Another area of Federal legislative reform that was useful _x000D_
is the area of reform for prescriptive practices within the VA _x000D_
system, and legislation in this area was recently authored and _x000D_
released by Senator Baldwin, and I applaud her for the two _x000D_
bills._x000D_
    The Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act models the _x000D_
reforms in the VA system after the best practices that the _x000D_
States are doing, and it applies them at the Federal level._x000D_
    Now, she also has another bill that passed some Senate _x000D_
hearings as well, the Heroin and Prescription Drug Abuse _x000D_
Prevention Act, and then there are good pieces that cover _x000D_
expanding access to Suboxone, increase the availability of _x000D_
Narcan, and access expansion for treatment, which is important._x000D_
    There are over 9 billion--with a B--Vicodin pills _x000D_
prescribed in the United States every year. It is estimated _x000D_
that between one-to two-thirds of these are not taken and are _x000D_
available lying around as leftovers. That is an excess supply _x000D_
every year of three to six billion pills. Fifty to 70 percent _x000D_
of the adolescents and young adults that abuse prescription _x000D_
drugs start by taking these leftovers._x000D_
    As the person becomes opioid dependent, tolerance develops, _x000D_
they need more pills, the cost of taking the increasing amounts _x000D_
of pills becomes too great, and the next step is, almost _x000D_
invariably, a switch to heroin use. As the chairman said, it is _x000D_
$10 a day or $10 a dose, so much cheaper than buying pills. In _x000D_
fact, 80 percent of heroin use starts with prescription opioids _x000D_
first._x000D_
    With the relatively cheap cost of heroin trafficked over _x000D_
the porous Southern border, along with drugs such as fentanyl _x000D_
and other synthetic opioids coming in over the border and _x000D_
through mail order, Wisconsin is awash in opioids. And, any _x000D_
bill that would encourage a change in this prescriptive _x000D_
practice, thus decreasing the amount of the excess opioid _x000D_
pills, would go a long way in addressing the current epidemic._x000D_
    We are actually currently working on a bill, fleshing an _x000D_
idea for a bill with Senator Johnson that would do exactly _x000D_
that, decrease that excess leftover supply._x000D_
    It is a small-volume, time-limited refill of a short-acting _x000D_
pain medication used for acute pain. Right now you cannot do _x000D_
refills on any medications. I want to go into a lot more detail _x000D_
to explain it, but I do not have the time. I had to cut some _x000D_
stuff."
2924494,2924493,2924495,19235,2,    We will give you some time.
2924495,2924494,2924496,19235,2,"    Excellent. So, at the State level here in _x000D_
Wisconsin, we have been blessed with the available leadership _x000D_
of Representative Nygren and Attorney General (AG) Schimel, who _x000D_
have thoroughly explored the best paths looking forward and _x000D_
what works and what does not in other States and truly _x000D_
listening to and involving all stakeholders in the process._x000D_
    In fact, we just came from a coalition meeting that had all _x000D_
the major health systems from the State in Madison, just like _x000D_
literally an hour ago, and that the purpose is to try to _x000D_
prepare the health systems unifying the best practices across _x000D_
the systems._x000D_
    They are really leading the country in establishing the _x000D_
ways that State government can best position the State and the _x000D_
community resources to address the epidemic._x000D_
    Thank you again, Chairman Johnson and Senator Baldwin, for _x000D_
the opportunity to testify, and thank you especially for your _x000D_
leadership on this issue in the battle against the scourge of _x000D_
prescription drug abuse. The bills you have both introduced _x000D_
will really help best position the State and our country to _x000D_
move forward, and it makes me proud to be from Wisconsin to see _x000D_
you guys both up there. Thank you."
2924496,2924495,2924497,19235,2,"    Thank you, Dr. Westlake. And, we will _x000D_
give you some time in that question-and-answer period to expand _x000D_
on some of those points you made._x000D_
    Our next two witnesses are a brother and sister, but they _x000D_
are also joined by their parents, Rick and Sandi Scott. And, _x000D_
again, I just want to thank you as a family for your courage _x000D_
coming forward. This is not an easy thing to talk about. It is _x000D_
not, you are laying your life out there, you're subjecting _x000D_
yourself to real scrutiny here, but you are doing it to save _x000D_
other lives. So, we really do appreciate that. So, we have _x000D_

                     OCONOMOWOC, WISCONSIN"
2924500,2924499,2924501,19235,4,"    Good afternoon. My name is Lauri Badura, and I _x000D_
am a wife, a mother, and a dedicated businesswoman. I want to _x000D_
thank my family, my husband behind me, my two sisters, and my _x000D_
two very best friends, Bill and Kelly, who are on my board, and _x000D_
all of the countless other people--there are several people _x000D_
that have lost children that came here today--or have children _x000D_
in detox today. So, I just wanted to share that before I start._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Badura appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 74._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I want to thank you, first off, for listening._x000D_
    Second, I wish to thank you both for your past and future _x000D_
commitment to stemming the raging tide of this epidemic._x000D_
    In 2014, the year that my son Archie died, in our country, _x000D_
we lost over 47,000 people. My statistic was quoted from the _x000D_
Centers for Disease Control (CDC). That is right, you heard it _x000D_
correctly. The figure was not a mistake. 47,000 people perished _x000D_
in this Nation due to drug addiction in one year alone!_x000D_
    Those of us who have lost loved ones to an opiate epidemic, _x000D_
those of us who advocate for more attention to this issue, _x000D_
please understand what we certainly understand, why the latest _x000D_
news reports center upon the gravity of worldwide incidents _x000D_
across the globe, where a dozen of people might be killed by _x000D_
terrorists, or where 25 or 68 people perish in a single suicide _x000D_
bomber attack, but we all defiantly cannot understand the _x000D_
importance of these news stories, with 47,000 compared to that._x000D_
    But, for moms and dads like us, we have lost our children _x000D_
to this opiate addiction and this epidemic. The lack of _x000D_
attention on this ridiculously large numbers of deaths, 47,000 _x000D_
in a single year, we do not always understand this lack of _x000D_
attention and outrage._x000D_
    That is why today is monumental. Because of your listening _x000D_
today and the scheduling of this hearing, you have changed the _x000D_
contours of this entire conversation. On behalf of the _x000D_
survivors here today, I applaud your leadership and express my _x000D_
deepest gratitude to each of you for the gift of your time and _x000D_
your talent._x000D_
    I was invited to speak to you because my son Archie died _x000D_
from a heroin overdose on May 15, 2014. And, I hope you have _x000D_
read my biography. I brought it along. You will read about the _x000D_
harrowing details of our family's personal hell. You will learn _x000D_
about Archie's cousin, who, while remaining alive, now lives _x000D_
with a debilitating traumatic brain injury at age 44. He will _x000D_
continue to require 24-hour, around-the-clock medical care for _x000D_
the rest of his life._x000D_
    Over the course of the past 2 years, I have told our story, _x000D_
a story of survival, to countless audiences of all ages, _x000D_
shapes, and sizes. But, today I want to talk to you about _x000D_
another aspect of my life. You see, every week I get calls from _x000D_
across southeastern Wisconsin, mostly from people who, like me, _x000D_
are coping with the pain of the death of a child._x000D_
    These people, many of them survivors of this opiate _x000D_
epidemic, are referred to me. Who refers them? You name it. I _x000D_
receive referrals from psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, _x000D_
priests, and business professionals--even my boss._x000D_
    And, this is not an exaggeration--I receive referrals from _x000D_
funeral homes. I have the Kleenex to prove it. That is right, _x000D_
funeral homes. The directors give my name out now._x000D_
    My commitment to all of these people is unwavering. I talk _x000D_
to each and every person who calls me seeking help. Each person _x000D_
is suffering with and struggling with the horrors of substance _x000D_
abuse addiction, and I am one who can empathize, identify, and _x000D_
relate to their experience._x000D_
    What does my inner drive to serve others come from? I am _x000D_
not entirely sure. No doubt my faith of God sustains me. There _x000D_
is also no doubt that my son Archie motivates me. I refuse to _x000D_
allow his life to be taken in vain._x000D_
     I make sure that his memory will live on, even if, through _x000D_
the efforts of his mom to help others cope with their pain and _x000D_
suffering, it is my mission to ensure that Archie's life story _x000D_
will continue to serve as an agent of change and transformation _x000D_
to saving others for Archie._x000D_
    So, what you might ask, is my life like today? Well, I just _x000D_
want to share that, 10 days ago, when I received your _x000D_
invitation to the hearing--I want to recount a few details of _x000D_
what these days are like, similar to Dr. Westlake. I think we _x000D_
get the same texts, possibly. I hope you will gain a little bit _x000D_
of vision of what it is like in my life today._x000D_
    On April 5, a mother called me. Her teenage son had died, _x000D_
and she wanted to know if her hell would ever be put away or _x000D_
will ever go away._x000D_
    Two days later, on April 7, another mother called. She got _x000D_
my name from a funeral director who buried her child, and she _x000D_
told me she does not know how she will ever get out of bed and _x000D_
get a break from her personal grief. She is just devastated._x000D_
    On April 8, I learned of a young man who knew both of our _x000D_
sons from childhood who died of a heroin overdose this weekend. _x000D_
I cooked dinner, brought it to their family, and we all sobbed _x000D_
in each other's arms as we looked at their Catholic school _x000D_
grade pictures. There were no words of comfort to offer. I sat _x000D_
in silence. This boy had carried my son's casket. It made no _x000D_
sense. That young man's funeral happened this past Saturday. I _x000D_
attended. The wounds reopened. I cried some more._x000D_
    Out of the blue a week ago, a psychologist called me. He _x000D_
asked permission to give my personal cell number to a patient, _x000D_
a woman that he feels he cannot reach. The psychologist has _x000D_
worked with this mother for a full year after she lost her 28-_x000D_
year-old daughter._x000D_
    This past weekend, a mother reached out to me with her 38-_x000D_
year-old son, who was turned away at the emergency room (ER) _x000D_
for a detoxer treatment. She had found him with a needle in his _x000D_
arm and did not know what to do. So, I made sure that she was _x000D_
armed with Narcan. She tried to call a hospital to get in, it _x000D_
would not be until next week, and she went to bed that night _x000D_
with the Narcan sleeping next to him. For two nights, that is _x000D_
how it was. The third morning, he was not there. He is still _x000D_
not home. The system let this mother and son down._x000D_
    I am not done, though. My son Augie called me from the _x000D_
University of Wisconsin (UW)-Eau Claire Sunday evening. Another _x000D_
freshman student in his dorm overdosed on opiates. Augie, who _x000D_
serves as a public speaker and knows more than anyone should at _x000D_
his age about drug addiction--it was Augie who was the first _x000D_
responder to this UW-Eau Claire student and called 911. The _x000D_
fellow student did survive and was grateful for Augie's quick _x000D_
thinking._x000D_
    So, you see, it is all over. There are several more _x000D_
messages on my phone looking for help, several that I have not _x000D_
even returned as of yet today. But, why me? Why do they call _x000D_
me? Why do psychologists, business professionals, and funeral _x000D_
directors call me? Sometimes I feel like I am not quite sure, _x000D_
because I have terrible days. You know what I am talking about, _x000D_
these days when you can barely get out of bed. The heaviness of _x000D_
the grief is insurmountable._x000D_
    In other venues, it may look like I have it all together. I _x000D_
enjoy a good deal of success as a business marketing executive. _x000D_
I feel quite natural serving clients across the Nation from the _x000D_
East Coast to California. In this realm, I am comfortable and I _x000D_
am confident._x000D_
    But, here in this realm, there is no business school for _x000D_
parents whose children are addicted to opiates, like heroin. In _x000D_
this realm, there is no textbook or guidebook to follow when _x000D_
you learn that your child has an addiction, no._x000D_
    But, people continue to reach out to me. I believe it is _x000D_
because I am raw, living-proof knowledge of this addiction _x000D_
storm. I lived it day after day with my son, Archie, and then I _x000D_
buried my own son._x000D_
    I am not embarrassed, nor do I apologize. I do not wallow _x000D_
in shame, nor do I blame others. Instead, I seek to find _x000D_
resources--resources which will build knowledge, create _x000D_
understanding, and help counsel others through this nightmare._x000D_
    Besides being a seeker, I am also waiting. I am waiting for _x000D_
leaders like you. It may be too late for my Archie and our _x000D_
family, but can we work together to save others? This hope is _x000D_
why I came today._x000D_
    I wanted to briefly share some urgent needs that I think _x000D_
are important from all the telephone calls and what I have _x000D_
heard from across the State, for not only our State, but our _x000D_
Nation._x000D_
    First, the medical treatment model needs reworking. Think _x000D_
diabetes: Lifelong care; lifelong approach. Addiction: Lifelong _x000D_
care; lifelong approach. We need to change the way we use _x000D_
healthcare in our Nation when it comes to opiate addiction. We _x000D_
need a treatment model because true opiate addiction needs _x000D_
medication. And, also, treatment needs to be uninterrupted by _x000D_
insurance companies. Addicts need to be able to focus on the _x000D_
recovery and not whether or not their insurance company is _x000D_
going to deny or end their coverage._x000D_
    Second, the window to get treatment is so narrow, and these _x000D_
families are being turned away each day they come to an ER to _x000D_
get help. HFS-75 opiate detox, in general, is urgently needed _x000D_
to stabilize a person and is part of a treatment-oriented _x000D_
system of care. Traditional opiate detox is not generally _x000D_
covered by health insurance. The need for some type of detox _x000D_
facility remains in communities, and alternatives to _x000D_
traditional opiate detox are being explored by the private _x000D_
sector, such as ambulatory detox, rapid, home-based programs, _x000D_
and even visiting nurses._x000D_
    Third, step up the medically assisted treatment to aid the _x000D_
opiate epidemic. Use medical-assisted treatment for opiate _x000D_
users in a recovery program and in drug courts as part of the _x000D_
law. We must provide Vivitrol for those incarcerated and for _x000D_
those newly released._x000D_
    Fourth, restricting access to drugs not just from Mexico, _x000D_
but from all our borders and boundaries and professional _x000D_
responsibility. Tighten up education to drug companies and _x000D_
better educate physicians, oral surgeons about the how-to's of _x000D_
writing an opiate script._x000D_
    Lastly, look into the data on those that have survived _x000D_
opiate overdose and the suffered brain trauma that are now _x000D_
wards of our State, like my nephew, that will need 24-hour care _x000D_
for the rest of his life and is unable to give back to society._x000D_
    Harnessing all of our stories together and looking at the _x000D_
hard facts for policymakers, this is the other side of the _x000D_
epidemic that nobody wants to speak about._x000D_
    So, I close with these five important unmet needs, and I _x000D_
hope my perspective provides you with insight so they may be _x000D_
reality for future policy changes. I thank you for your time, _x000D_
and hopefully together we can save lives. Thank you."
2924501,2924500,2924502,19235,5,"    Thank you, Lauri. Obviously, our sincere _x000D_
condolences to you and your family. Our sincere thanks for your _x000D_
commitment to help others turn your tragedy and the loss of _x000D_
Archie to something positive, trying to help others, and just _x000D_
for your courage for testifying here today._x000D_
    Tyler, I want to go to you, because you said you tried _x000D_
different types of treatments--different types of medications _x000D_
to get you off of heroin, and then finally one worked._x000D_
    Can you describe what did not work and why it did not work _x000D_
and what finally worked with you?"
2924502,2924501,2924503,19235,5,"    So, in your testimony, you described _x000D_
yourself pretty low stages for quite some time."
2924503,2924502,2924504,19235,5,"    But, I mean, we always hear hitting rock _x000D_
bottom. I mean, it really was when your parents kicked you out _x000D_
of the house, you were living in some situation, and then it _x000D_
was when your mom called? I mean, what--describe rock--I hate _x000D_
to say this, but describe rock bottom, and what was different _x000D_
about it than what you were describing, which sounded pretty _x000D_
rock bottom while you were in the house as well every morning _x000D_
waking up. What is the difference?_x000D_
    Then, Lauri, I am going to come to you, because I want to _x000D_
hear how that relates in terms of your situation."
2924504,2924503,2924505,19235,5,"    Ashleigh, real quick, did you and your _x000D_
parents, did you recognize rock bottom? Did you see something _x000D_
different about it this time?"
2924505,2924504,2924506,19235,5,"    Other than that attitude of now I really _x000D_
hit rock bottom, was there a difference in the treatment or was _x000D_
it strictly just the attitude?"
2924506,2924505,2924507,19235,5,"    So, you were with Tyler. So, now you went _x000D_
through treatment, to a certain extent, together."
2924507,2924506,2924508,19235,5,"    And, that was the first time that _x000D_
happened. And, Tyler, was that--I mean, in addition to hitting _x000D_
rock bottom, was that family treatment, was that also key?"
2924508,2924507,2924509,19235,5,"    Lauri, I hate to even ask, because I hate _x000D_
to have you go through this process again, but were there _x000D_
attempts to put Archie in treatment? Did those work, did they _x000D_
not work, _x000D_
or--and/or can you talk about because you are helping so many _x000D_
other people, can you relate to this? Can you kind of----"
2924509,2924508,2924510,19235,5,"    Yes, I can. And, I do not feel guilty, Tyler. _x000D_
We love you, and we are so glad you made it. But, Tyler is an _x000D_
anomaly. There is not a lot of them that make it out, there _x000D_
really is not. I wish there was a lot of Tylers. I wish I knew _x000D_
them; I do not. So, I am so glad. I mean, our families are _x000D_
close. We know each other well. They knew Archie._x000D_
    I guess, I have my sisters and husband, and it was 4 years _x000D_
of hell. It was marijuana. So, everybody says, oh, heroin. That _x000D_
was not even introduced before 2 months before he died._x000D_
    So, I guess rock bottom? There were so many rock bottoms. _x000D_
We kept thinking, this is it, this is it. But, if you look on _x000D_
the last page, when you walk into an ER and see that your kid _x000D_
ingested an opiate patch, and the physician said most kids _x000D_
ingest a spoonful, he ate the entire patch and was foaming at _x000D_
the mouth. This is his first overdose. He should have died that _x000D_
day, January 3; he did not. If anybody wants to see it back _x000D_
there._x000D_
    There were several times. And, just like any addict, they _x000D_
do not want to die. They are off trying to get to a high of _x000D_
feeling better, but this drug owns them. They are in a jail of _x000D_
something that none of us can understand._x000D_
    I cannot tell you how many people said to me, how in the _x000D_
world could that boy carry your casket and then he overdose _x000D_
this weekend? I said, because you do not get it, you really do _x000D_
not get it. People who say that, ``Oh, they can just stop''--_x000D_
they cannot. You cannot. And, it does, it starts with the _x000D_
pills. It starts with the pills, and then it goes, as you said, _x000D_
$10."
2924510,2924509,2924511,19235,5,"    Tyler, when we were in the back and I _x000D_
asked Neal what he knows about the percentage of successful _x000D_
treatment. About 1 in 10 is what he said. That actually _x000D_
surprised me as being high._x000D_
    By the way, Rick and Sandi, if you would not mind, at the _x000D_
end of the panel, I will have you come forward if you wanted to _x000D_
just say a couple words or if there is something that you want _x000D_
to express here. That may be powerful._x000D_
    I do want to go to Mr. Bohn and Dr. Westlake. Anything you _x000D_
can kind of chime in on the treatment aspect of this? Things _x000D_
that you know, that we understand. Obviously, Dr. Westlake, you _x000D_
treat the emergency side of this equation._x000D_
    But Mr. Bohn?"
2924511,2924510,2924512,19235,5,"    One of the things we have learned from law _x000D_
enforcement over the years is the fact that it is going to take _x000D_
treatment to get people, otherwise we are going to see them _x000D_
again and again in the criminal justice system. We have now got _x000D_
an entire generation of addicted people out there._x000D_
    We focus on the people that bring it in. We focus on the _x000D_
people that deal in this stuff. But, I can tell you, the high _x000D_
level violators that bring this stuff in are smart enough to _x000D_
know not to use it, because they know how dangerous it is._x000D_
    So, it will take a lot of prevention, it will take a lot of _x000D_
rehabilitation, but law enforcement has a duty as well to keep _x000D_
it out as much as possible."
2924512,2924511,2924513,19235,5,"    Could you just kind of speak to what we _x000D_
know about the success rate of treatment? Then I will turn it _x000D_
over to Senator Baldwin to ask questions."
2924513,2924512,2924514,19235,5,"    So, yes, I mean, my area of expertise really _x000D_
is more in emergency medicine, some of the policy areas, but it _x000D_
is abyssmal results. I mean, once someone gets addicted, it is, _x000D_
one out of 20, one out of ten tops. So, there is a lot of _x000D_
different drugs that are addictive._x000D_
    Alcohol, you are an alcohol addict, and you have maybe 50 _x000D_
years of drinking before you die. You get too drunk, you pass _x000D_
out, you throw up, maybe a car accident if it is that horrible._x000D_
    You take too much heroin one time, you take one pill, like _x000D_
this kid last week, and you are dead. And so, there is just no _x000D_
room for error._x000D_
    And, the biggest thing, we just had this coalition meeting, _x000D_
we asked the health systems, how can we partner together? We _x000D_
brought States together, the Department of Homeland Security _x000D_
(DHS) and all kinds of players at that level, and the shortfall _x000D_
is in the treatment. So, there is not enough treatment _x000D_
fighters._x000D_
    If we could get all the addicts, 168,000 opioid addicts, if _x000D_
we could get them into treatment now, we do not have, so that _x000D_
is an important piece._x000D_
    I believe in limited government, that the funds really need _x000D_
to be justified to be spent, but I think the return on _x000D_
investment for getting people clean is huge, and it is well _x000D_
worth the cost."
2924514,2924513,2924515,19235,5,"    What was shocking, before I turn it over _x000D_
to Senator Baldwin, in the testimony, I think you said the _x000D_
average beginning age was 11. Eleven years old. You were in _x000D_
sixth grade--11 or 12?"
2924515,2924514,2924516,19235,5,"    Nothing glamorous about that, is there?"
2924516,2924515,2924517,19235,5,    Senator Baldwin.
2924517,2924516,2924518,19235,5,"    Thank you all again for your amazing and _x000D_
powerful testimony. I want to just pursue a number of the _x000D_
issues that each of you raised a little more deeply._x000D_
    Lauri Badura, if I can start with you. You just described _x000D_
your last few weeks. You are like the key resource for people _x000D_
who have your cell number and people who give out your cell _x000D_
number. We have an epidemic, and it strikes me that people have _x000D_
no idea where to turn, what to do. It does not sound like an _x000D_
emergency response to an epidemic at all._x000D_
    Tell me, what is out there for parents? When you talk to _x000D_
them, of course, you are doing some personal counseling. You _x000D_
are sharing your experience, hugging them. What sort of formal _x000D_
resources are out there, especially if you are hearing from _x000D_
parents who have not lost their children yet?"
2924518,2924517,2924519,19235,5,"    Absolutely. I am so glad you are asking. I am _x000D_
on the Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (AODA) advisory committee _x000D_
for Waukesha County, and there are several wonderful things _x000D_
that are out there, but there are many--it is hard getting the _x000D_
word out there. They are doing great things, but no one _x000D_
really--I call it connecting the dots. That is if you look up _x000D_
my name--most people Google ``heroin mom,'' and my name comes _x000D_
up._x000D_
    So, I call it connecting the dots in the State because each _x000D_
county is doing fabulous. I mean, I have worked with Milwaukee. _x000D_
No one is talking to each other. Why redo each other's work? _x000D_
But, what I would tell somebody that would call is there is _x000D_
something called 211, which is--you know what that is, right?"
2924519,2924518,2924520,19235,5,    Of course.
2924520,2924519,2924521,19235,5,"    OK, the 211. And then, a lot of people do not _x000D_
know it. So, they are just comforted with that fact._x000D_
    If they cannot, most of the problem is a lot of these _x000D_
people, the resources are tapped, there is no more insurance, _x000D_
they have done treatments, most of them, I would say, have done _x000D_
three, under their family's insurance, and they are tapped out._x000D_
    So, then they go to a county, and the county it takes 4 or _x000D_
5 days on a good day. That is what my friend was waiting for _x000D_
this past weekend when the boy--they were trying to wait to get _x000D_
him in, and that is just because they are so backed up._x000D_
    But, I know so besides that, it is arming--if you are _x000D_
living with somebody with an addiction and they are using _x000D_
opiates, you have to have the Narcan, and the public does not _x000D_
know about that._x000D_
    There is great resources here that are training, they are _x000D_
handing out needles, they are doing things here, but they just _x000D_
need help getting the word out._x000D_
    There is also the Addiction Resource Council (ARC), they _x000D_
are doing fabulous things, but we do not even have counselors. _x000D_
The counselors are going to age out soon, and there is not _x000D_
enough counselors to counsel people. Because, really, Archie _x000D_
was 77 days clean. He wanted to be clean. That is the most _x000D_
dangerous time. You can get them through treatment, but they _x000D_
still need--that is why I am saying, ``We need the care like _x000D_
diabetes, where for life, you are getting looked at, you are _x000D_
getting to see a doctor and saying, `OK, how is it going? Well, _x000D_
maybe you need to go do this again.' ''_x000D_
    So, those are the steps. And, there is also--I give several _x000D_
different numbers of private homes, that care that will take _x000D_
the people, and then public places, but there is not many beds."
2924521,2924520,2924522,19235,5,"    About those beds. Just in terms of your _x000D_
own knowledge and your own experience, is it because of lack of _x000D_
professionals to staff them or lack of local resources, State _x000D_
resources, national resources to fund them, lack of insurance _x000D_
coverage, all of the above?"
2924522,2924521,2924523,19235,5,    It is really all the above.
2924523,2924522,2924524,19235,5,"    I think I know the answer to the question, _x000D_
but I want to hear you----"
2924524,2924523,2924525,19235,5,"    No, but it is a great question. Like Lutheran _x000D_
Social Services (LSS) is one I can tell you in Waukesha County _x000D_
who has been pushed around because they cannot get a building. _x000D_
Nobody wants them. And, they have the funds, they are ready to _x000D_
have a building, and I know they are working on that, so--but _x000D_
people do not want a hospital full of addicts maybe in their _x000D_
neighborhood, I do not know. I know that is one problem._x000D_
    I think that they are definitely limited on doctors. I _x000D_
think we do not have the physicians as many as possible. I know _x000D_
we do not have the counselors. I absolutely know that._x000D_
    But, I think our resources for what the epidemic has done. _x000D_
Because I joined this advisory group when Archie was alive, I _x000D_
came to this meeting saying, please help, my son is so sick, _x000D_
please help, I do not know what to do. And, I wanted to educate _x000D_
myself._x000D_
    I can tell you, in those 2 years, these people that are _x000D_
working in their daily job--it is not my daily job--they are _x000D_
tapped. There is nothing. They are not getting any more help. I _x000D_
mean, we really need more people, more resources, more help. _x000D_
And, I am thinking almost like hospice care, where it is, it is _x000D_
in your home, and people come. I am not sure, because I know it _x000D_
is expensive. But, we have to save lives."
2924525,2924524,2924526,19235,5,"    That is right._x000D_
    Tyler and Ashleigh, before I ask the question, I also want _x000D_
to give you permission to plug the prevention work that you _x000D_
have done through Your Choice to Live. We will get a series of _x000D_
public service announcements as I go across and ask questions, _x000D_
so if you want to say anything about that as a precursor._x000D_
    But, Tyler, I want to ask you about the impact of your _x000D_
interactions with the criminal justice system. You talked about _x000D_
several arrests, I think several incarcerations at the local _x000D_
level. And, I understand that everybody's path is different. _x000D_
Were those experiences helpful or motivational for you to _x000D_
actually make the decision to ultimately seek treatment? How _x000D_
did that play out in the path that your addiction took?"
2924526,2924525,2924527,19235,5,"    Dr. Westlake, I have a question for you, _x000D_
but before, you just heard Ms. Badura say that too few people _x000D_
even know about Narcan or naloxone. So, for people in this room _x000D_
who might not know, for people who might be hearing about this _x000D_
hearing by watching the nightly news, can you give us one _x000D_
minute on what the heck those two drugs--or what that one drug _x000D_
with two different names is, what it does, and why people need _x000D_
to know about it?"
2924527,2924526,2924528,19235,5,"    Sure, yes. Narcan, or naloxone is the drug _x000D_
name for it, is an opioid reversal agent. So, what happens when _x000D_
you take opiates is they sedate your respirations, they fill _x000D_
these chemical receptors in your brain, and eventually it _x000D_
suppresses your respirations so much, you stop breathing, it _x000D_
lowers your oxygen level, and your heart stops after that._x000D_
    What the Narcan does, if you can get it in before that _x000D_
whole cycle is completed, is it kicks off all the opioid _x000D_
chemical analogs, and so it clears it, just immediately, _x000D_
literally takes them off. I have given it to patients where _x000D_
they come in and they are breathing at two breaths a minute and _x000D_
they are blue, I give it to them, and if you give a little too _x000D_
much, sometimes they are wide awake and they are angry as heck _x000D_
right away. I mean, it is just like turning a switch, if you _x000D_
can get it in the patient in time."
2924528,2924527,2924529,19235,5,"    Just real quick, is there any danger to _x000D_
having that in the general population? Is there any abuse of _x000D_
that drug?"
2924529,2924528,2924530,19235,5,"    No. The theoretical risk would be, well, are _x000D_
you motivating people to feel safer using? And, initially, I _x000D_
kind of thought that maybe 10 years ago, until I had some _x000D_
insight into it. And absolutely, those people are going to be _x000D_
using. When you are an addict, that is what you do, is you use._x000D_
    And then, I think Attorney General Schimel is going to talk _x000D_
about it, he is pushing to possibly go the Food and Drug _x000D_
Administration (FDA) with no prescription necessary._x000D_
    And, I think--I mean, the only issue I would have would be _x000D_
that we have to make sure the supply is enough that we can get _x000D_
it in the ambulance services. I would not want it to just _x000D_
disappear, and all of a sudden there is shortages, because _x000D_
there are drug shortages on a lot of different things. So, but _x000D_
apart from that, there is _x000D_
no--other than, you feel a lot of pain if you give it to _x000D_
someone."
2924530,2924529,2924531,19235,5,"    Is it injected, or how is it----"
2924531,2924530,2924532,19235,5,"    You can shoot it in someone's nose. So, there _x000D_
is a nasal atomizer that you can use. You can inject it."
2924532,2924531,2924533,19235,5,    Sorry to take your time.
2924533,2924532,2924534,19235,5,"    No, I absolutely wanted this to be a _x000D_
public service announcement on this topic. I have a question _x000D_
too, but----"
2924534,2924533,2924535,19235,5,"    Yes, it is a great message._x000D_
important question. And, not unlike the distribution of clean _x000D_
needles to prevent other deaths related to people who shoot _x000D_
drugs, this does have that side debate, but it reverses an _x000D_
overdose._x000D_
    So, my question for you actually relates to the recently _x000D_
released Centers for Disease Control safe prescribing _x000D_
guidelines. I think they went through a fairly long process _x000D_
trying to look at the latest evidence on appropriate and safe _x000D_
use of opioid pain medications._x000D_
    I would like to ask you, in terms of educating your peers _x000D_
in the medical community about safe and appropriate _x000D_
prescribing, sort of what is the most important piece of _x000D_
information that this guidance should include to support _x000D_
prescribers in preventing adverse outcomes of addiction and _x000D_
recognizing addiction in their practices?"
2924535,2924534,2924536,19235,5,"    Yes, the guideline piece is--we actually just _x000D_
pushed and Representative Nygren had a bill that went through _x000D_
that we just signed that gave the Medical Exam Board the _x000D_
ability to promulgate guidelines. We actually--Mike McNett is a _x000D_
doc that I work with who would come--modified the CDC _x000D_
guidelines and put them into our language._x000D_
    The thing that is important is to get the changes to come _x000D_
from underneath within. So, you have to get the providers, _x000D_
which I think there is an awareness now, to understand that _x000D_
there is inappropriate prescription. So, it cannot just be _x000D_
another Federal mandate like, you got to do this and it needs _x000D_
to come from underneath within the health systems and from _x000D_
within the doctors. And so, what we are trying to do at the _x000D_
State level, through the controlled substances committee, which _x000D_
is what promulgates the guidelines, is to have input from the _x000D_
stakeholders._x000D_
    So, then when we come out with these guidelines, the _x000D_
systems can then say, OK, these are reasonable guidelines, they _x000D_
are good guidelines. And, when you get buy-in from the _x000D_
providers in the systems, then it can be incorporated into the _x000D_
culture of the practice, and education is important with that _x000D_
as well._x000D_
    It has to be limited, though. Because, again, we have a _x000D_
crisis now, so there is a huge opioid epidemic. The problem I _x000D_
have with legislation, State and especially Federal, is once it _x000D_
is in place, it is never going to get repealed. There is never _x000D_
going to be enough will to repeal it._x000D_
    So, if you put something in place--there is a great piece _x000D_
of legislation that had, continuing medical education (CME)--4 _x000D_
years of opioid CME per year for the DEA. The problem with that _x000D_
is in 20 years, hopefully, the culture will have changed that _x000D_
it will not be a problem, but I will still be stuck doing 4 _x000D_
hours of opiate CME._x000D_
    And so, that is the thing is, that Representative Nygren _x000D_
used sunsetting. So, after three years, the restrictions on _x000D_
checking the prescription database will go away. And then, _x000D_
hopefully by then, the culture of prescriptive practice will _x000D_
have changed. So, that is the wisdom of the legislation."
2924536,2924535,2924537,19235,5,"    Yes. But, and you raise a great point. I _x000D_
remember reading an article about how sometimes change in the _x000D_
medical community is slow, and it was Dr. Gawande talking about _x000D_
how a recipe change in New York City was adopted universally in _x000D_
all the certain type of restaurant in 7 days, but it took 7 _x000D_
years to change a protocol at the medical profession. So, we _x000D_
obviously need to put a huge exclamation point behind these new _x000D_
guidelines."
2924537,2924536,2924538,19235,5,"    And, have the systems within own their part _x000D_
of the guidelines."
2924538,2924537,2924539,19235,5,"    Yes, exactly._x000D_
    One last question of this panel from me for you, Mr. Bohn. _x000D_
So, you have the rather unique role of overseeing the _x000D_
coordination among so many different levels of the Federal, _x000D_
State, and local law enforcement efforts to combat drug _x000D_
trafficking._x000D_
    And, I guess I just want to--from that unique perspective, _x000D_
I want to know how you believe it Is working and what more we _x000D_
can be doing at the Federal level in Congress to support _x000D_
coordination to more effectively combat the flow of heroin and _x000D_
other illegal opioids into this community."
2924539,2924538,2924540,19235,5,"    It is just that the support is both funding for _x000D_
training, for enforcement, and for prevention methods. In _x000D_
HIDTA, we have a heroin-specific task force that we have just _x000D_
beefed up by about 50 percent with more manpower, but at the _x000D_
same time, we are always doing costly training out there._x000D_
    We are training law enforcement, because in a lot of the _x000D_
communities, this is something relatively new to, on how to _x000D_
handle overdose investigations and--because it is in every _x000D_
community._x000D_
    At the same time, we do a lot of public awareness training _x000D_
to go out and just let people know that this is out there. And, _x000D_
we have participated in countless heroin summits around the--_x000D_
and opioid summits around the State to raise awareness both _x000D_
within law enforcement and within the public in general._x000D_
    We are working hard to get the intelligence sharing that _x000D_
needs to be done at the law enforcement level so that all the _x000D_
agencies that are participating in these share intelligence so _x000D_
that we can make connections and close those intelligence gaps _x000D_
as well._x000D_
    So, there is several levels to the problem, several levels _x000D_
to the solution, and it is not going to be one thing; it is _x000D_
going to be a multifaceted solution."
2924540,2924539,2924541,19235,5,    Thank you.
2924541,2924540,2924542,19235,5,"    Thank you, Senator Baldwin. I do not want _x000D_
to put too much pressure on Rick or Sandi. Would you like to _x000D_
make any comments before we seat the next panel? Do you think _x000D_
Ashleigh did a pretty good job for you?"
2924542,2924541,2924543,19235,5,    OK. I think she did as well.
2924543,2924542,2924544,19235,5,"    Thank you all for your powerful _x000D_
testimony. This is not the last hearing on this, trust me. So, _x000D_
thank you, and we will seat the next panel with that."
2924544,2924543,2924545,19235,6,"    As I mentioned to the earlier panel, it _x000D_
is our tradition to swear in witnesses, so if you all rise and _x000D_
raise your right hand._x000D_
    Do you swear the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God._x000D_
    Please be seated._x000D_
    Our first witness is Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, and we _x000D_
know you have a hard stop at 4:30, so when we get done with the _x000D_
testimony, we will come to you and ask you the questions, and _x000D_
then, feel free to, I guess, probably catch your plane, right?"
2924545,2924544,2924546,19235,6,"    Thank you, Senator. I appreciate _x000D_
it."
2924546,2924545,2924547,19235,6,"    So, Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske is our _x000D_
first witness. He is the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. _x000D_
Commissioner Kerlikowske is also the former director of the _x000D_
Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr. Kerlikowske has _x000D_
four decades of law enforcement and drug policy experience._x000D_
    And, again, I just want to express our--this committee's _x000D_
thanks for all the traveling you have done to participate in _x000D_
these similar types of hearings in the States which are being _x000D_
affected by this tragedy. Commissioner._x000D_
_x000D_
TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE,\1\ COMMISSIONER, _x000D_

2924547,2924546,2924548,19235,6,"    Thank you._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Kerlikowske appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 76._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Chairman Johnson and Senator Baldwin, thank you so much for _x000D_
the opportunity to appear today and to be here to discuss this _x000D_
significant abuse and addiction issue of heroin. It is an _x000D_
important discussion about a complex, difficult challenge that _x000D_
our Nation faces._x000D_
    Customs and Border Protection has a critical role in the _x000D_
effort to keep heroin and other dangerous drugs out of _x000D_
communities. We seize nearly 4 tons of illegal drugs every _x000D_
single day, and it is a variety of drugs. Our seizures of _x000D_
heroin increased 22 percent in the last fiscal year (FY)._x000D_
    While the vast majority of the seizures still occur along _x000D_
the southwest border, we interdict heroin in all modes, air, _x000D_
land and sea, in both the travel and the cargo environments. _x000D_
Add in between the ports of entry (POE), our frontline officers _x000D_
and agents use a variety of technology and assets, everything _x000D_
from canine to large x-radiation (x-ray) equipment, etc., along _x000D_
with intelligence and information sharing with our State, _x000D_
local, and Federal partners._x000D_
    Continued efforts to intercept drugs at the border are a _x000D_
key aspect of addressing the crisis, but I think we all know _x000D_
and recognize that interdiction and arrests alone will not _x000D_
solve this problem._x000D_
    President Obama conveyed just a couple weeks ago at the _x000D_
National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta _x000D_
that we need to focus efforts on prevention and treatment in _x000D_
conjunction with the deterrence of drug trafficking via _x000D_
criminal organizations. And, we need to better integrate our _x000D_
efforts and share information._x000D_
    I am pleased to support the Department of Justice (DOJ) and _x000D_
the Office of National Drug Control Policy on the National _x000D_
Heroin Task Force, which fosters a collaborative relationship _x000D_
between public health and law enforcement across all levels of _x000D_
government._x000D_
    Law enforcement at all levels is committed to security, but _x000D_
also in protecting the health and safety of the public. And, _x000D_
for Customs and Border Protection, this is especially important _x000D_
because nationwide we encounter nearly 1 million people every _x000D_
day that come into our country through our ports of entry. And, _x000D_
we were the first Federal law enforcement agency to initiate _x000D_
naloxone training for our officers who may encounter someone _x000D_
experiencing an overdose._x000D_
    I want to acknowledge the significant strides that we have _x000D_
made with Mexico and that they have taken in recent years to _x000D_
address transnational organized crime, and narcotic smuggling _x000D_
specifically. The relationship with our Mexican counterparts is _x000D_
stronger today than it ever has been, and while more can be _x000D_
done, we know that we receive information from Mexican _x000D_
authorities on a daily basis. They sit with us in some of our _x000D_
targeting centers, we work closely with them, and I think the _x000D_
recognition that we are all very much in this together is _x000D_
clear._x000D_
    So, thank you for holding this important hearing, and I am _x000D_
happy to answer your questions at the appropriate time. Thank _x000D_
you."
2924548,2924547,2924549,19235,6,"    Thank you, Commissioner._x000D_
    Our next witness is Attorney General Brad Schimel. Attorney _x000D_
General Schimel was elected as the Wisconsin Attorney General _x000D_
on November 4, 2014. A front-line prosecutor, first elected _x000D_
Waukesha County District Attorney in 2006, Schimel has pledged _x000D_
as attorney general to put public safety over politics and _x000D_
continue to fight against heroin and human traffickers. General _x000D_
Schimel."
2924549,2924548,2924550,19235,6,"    Good afternoon. And, thank you, Chairman _x000D_
Johnson and Senator Baldwin, for the opportunity to testify, _x000D_
and thank you for both of your commitment too._x000D_
    Thank you for your commitment to finding bipartisan ways to _x000D_
address this opiate epidemic that we are facing. Some of the _x000D_
legislation that you have both proposed will make a difference _x000D_
in this battle for us._x000D_
    And, Senator Baldwin, you asked whether--in the question-_x000D_
and-answer (Q&A) period earlier, whether this was an--this _x000D_
sounded like an emergency response to a crisis, and it does _x000D_
not. And, many of the people in this room have been on kind of _x000D_
the speaking circuit together for a long time, and we have been _x000D_
asking for a long time, after we talk about the nature of the _x000D_
problem, we are asking people what are we prepared to do about _x000D_
this?_x000D_
    We have seen in the course of a little over a decade, _x000D_
opiate overdose deaths more than quadruple. And, if we saw that _x000D_
kind of a change in traffic crash deaths, we would put a _x000D_
roundabout every 200 feet. We would lower speed limits to 15. _x000D_
We would not let people get their driver's license till they _x000D_
are 30. We would do things that sound crazy. And yet, as to _x000D_
this, we are still kind of struggling for awareness. So, I _x000D_
appreciate your committee's willingness to help raise this _x000D_
awareness._x000D_
    I do not want to repeat things that others said, but I will _x000D_
reiterate what Mr. Bohn said. This is also driving virtually _x000D_
every other kind of crime in our nation._x000D_
    Dr. Westlake, he has had enough in the emergency _x000D_
department. Me, I have had enough. There have been years in _x000D_
Waukesha County where we have had close to 50 overdose deaths, _x000D_
right in this one county while I was the district attorney _x000D_
(DA). I have met now all along the way, hundreds of parents who _x000D_
have buried their children. I have had enough. I am tired of _x000D_
this._x000D_
    The law enforcement officers and emergency medical services _x000D_
(EMS) that are in this room today, they have had enough, of _x000D_
often going back over and over to the same house, to the same _x000D_
person, who was saved recently and just went right back to _x000D_
using, because we do not have enough help for them. And, they _x000D_
are often, as Tyler Lybert said, they are often not ready to _x000D_
get help._x000D_
    And, the Lyberts and Mrs. Badura, we have spoken together _x000D_
dozens of times, and still, every time any of them talk, I _x000D_
still get choked up and get teary-eyed, because their story _x000D_
does not get any better no matter how many times you hear it._x000D_
    So, ask any law enforcement officer here in this room or _x000D_
anywhere, what is the worst problem we have seen in the last _x000D_
quarter century, this is it, this is the one._x000D_
    And, now, you have heard a lot about how this devastates _x000D_
people in many ways. There is one way that has not been _x000D_
mentioned yet, and that is employers. It is affecting our _x000D_
economy. Four out of five employers in a survey conducted in _x000D_
Indiana, which is not so different from Wisconsin, four out of _x000D_
five employers in that survey had to address opiate abuse and _x000D_
addiction in their workplace. Conservative estimates suggest _x000D_
that opiate abuse is costing employers nationwide over $26 _x000D_
billion annually. This is affecting our economy._x000D_
    And, I do not want to repeat all the things that have been _x000D_
said about the issue on the border, but any discussion about _x000D_
this problem has to include a discussion about our Nation's _x000D_
international borders. In years past, heroin came to America _x000D_
from southeast and southwest Asia. Because it was so hard to _x000D_
get it here, it had to be cut drastically in order to be _x000D_
profitable._x000D_
    In the 1980s, the average heroin purity on the street was _x000D_
about 5 percent. We do not see 5 percent anymore, because it is _x000D_
so easy to get it into our country, they do not have to cut it _x000D_
to make it profitable. Instead, they are competing with each _x000D_
other for who has the most potent heroin. And so, now we find _x000D_
heroin between 20 percent and all the way up to close to 80 _x000D_
percent pure. And, when you look at it in your hand, you do not _x000D_
know what you have. That is part of why we are seeing so many _x000D_
overdoses, because a young person, or even a middle-aged _x000D_
person, using that has no idea. So, it is going to be necessary _x000D_
in this to address the border security as part of this problem._x000D_
    And, I want to mention methamphetamine. Mr. Bohn mentioned _x000D_
it briefly. Wisconsin and many other States took drastic steps _x000D_
to make it harder to produce methamphetamine here in America. _x000D_
So, we made it harder to buy the necessary ingredients to make _x000D_
it, and we have cut down domestic production._x000D_
    Unfortunately, the production shifted to Mexico. Our _x000D_
problem with methamphetamine is worse than it was before, and _x000D_
it is growing, and it is spread to parts of our State that did _x000D_
not use to have the problem. So, we do have to address the _x000D_
border in this issue._x000D_
    And, in terms of how we are going to solve this problem, it _x000D_
has been said as well today that this is an all-hands-on-deck _x000D_
answer that we need to have. Law enforcement will not do this _x000D_
alone, treatment will not do it alone, and prevention will not _x000D_
do it alone, but they all three have to be as a part of this._x000D_
    One of the challenges is that unlike investigating an armed _x000D_
robbery that happens at one place and one point in time, the _x000D_
drug trafficking does not respect any municipal or State _x000D_
boundaries. It is moving everywhere. And, it is necessary for _x000D_
law enforcement to be able to work across jurisdictions _x000D_
together._x000D_
    One of the ways they have been able to do that over the _x000D_
years is through the assistance of the Byrne Justice Assistance _x000D_
Grants. Those grants have been shrinking over the years, and it _x000D_
is making it harder for the local, municipal police departments _x000D_
and the metropolitan drug enforcement groups to do their work._x000D_
    And, it has been years ago already now in Waukesha County, _x000D_
and I am a little bit reluctant to even say this out loud, but _x000D_
years ago we stopped focusing on marijuana at all with our _x000D_
metropolitan drug enforcement group because the opiate problem _x000D_
is consuming so much of our efforts._x000D_
    Narcan has also been mentioned today, and I just want to _x000D_
echo the comments. There is no reason to take it unless you _x000D_
need to reverse an opiate overdose. You do not get high off of _x000D_
it, it does not do anything to you, it has no harmful effects. _x000D_
Still, it requires a prescription. I am hoping we can see that _x000D_
change._x000D_
    Also, medication assisted treatment has been mentioned. _x000D_
And, you heard from Mrs. Badura about the concerns that _x000D_
oftentimes, a person who has been confined, be it a jail, a _x000D_
prison, or inpatient treatment, oftentimes the most dangerous _x000D_
time for them is right after their release. Relapse is a very _x000D_
common phenomenon, and their tolerance is now lower, and _x000D_
frequently they try to use at the same level they did before _x000D_
they were confined, and we are seeing so many of the overdose _x000D_
deaths happen at that time frame._x000D_
    Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) can help with this. We _x000D_
should fund having this available to people who are about to _x000D_
get out of jail or prison, people who are going to get out of a _x000D_
treatment setting, so that they can have assistance in _x000D_
resisting those urges that result in relapse._x000D_
    And, then one of the wisest things we have done in the _x000D_
criminal justice system--and that was also mentioned by Tyler _x000D_
Lybert--have been treatment courts. And, we have now treatments _x000D_
courts in about half of the counties in Wisconsin._x000D_
    Most of the counties that did that, like Waukesha County, _x000D_
when we started up our drug treatment court, we did so with _x000D_
Federal grant assistance, a startup grant. That is invaluable. _x000D_
You cannot get your county board to pony up the money to start _x000D_
it until you can demonstrate that it is doing something, that _x000D_
those startup grants are critical. You can start them up and _x000D_
you can show your county board the graduates and how your _x000D_
county is becoming healthier as a result, and then they will _x000D_
continue to fund it. So, please continue to support those _x000D_
grants to startup treatment courts. It is the wisest thing we _x000D_
have done, because we have started as a criminal justice system _x000D_
to treat addiction not as a felony, but as the disease it is, _x000D_
and it is a real opportunity for us._x000D_
    And, I also encourage making available more competitive _x000D_
grants. There are innovative ideas out there, in law _x000D_
enforcement, in social services, in nongovernmental groups. The _x000D_
only problem is, they are expensive, and, again, they have to _x000D_
demonstrate success before they can get that outside funding. _x000D_
Start-up grants, a competitive process, administered by the _x000D_
Office of Justice Assistance or the National Association of _x000D_
Attorneys General (NAAG), you name it, they can make a _x000D_
difference in finding new ways to approach this problem._x000D_
    So, I appreciate very much the committee's interest in _x000D_
tackling this Nation's opiate epidemic, and thank you, Chairman _x000D_
Johnson and Senator Baldwin, for the opportunity to testify _x000D_
today and for your work."
2924550,2924549,2924551,19235,6,"    Thank you, General Schimel._x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE JON ERPENBACH,\1\ STATE SENATOR, _x000D_
                DISTRICT 27, STATE OF WISCONSIN"
2924551,2924550,2924552,19235,6,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_

    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Erpenbach appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 86._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    First, I would like to commend Brad and John for their work _x000D_
on this issue. They say Democrats and Republicans in Madison _x000D_
cannot get along. We have on this issue. And, especially John _x000D_
with his work on this has been great, and you too as well, Mr. _x000D_
Chairman and Senator Baldwin. I really truly appreciate what _x000D_
you have done._x000D_
    The problem we are talking about today is well documented. _x000D_
I do not need to spend a whole lot of time on statistics other _x000D_
than to say, we would not be here if it was not the urgent _x000D_
problem that it is._x000D_
    The State of Wisconsin and the Federal Government need to _x000D_
partner together if we are going to be successful in the fight _x000D_
against this epidemic. In my testimony today, I will talk about _x000D_
a couple of different ways that we can partner together, the _x000D_
local, State, and Federal Governments, to combat the epidemic _x000D_
that brings us all here today._x000D_
    I am proud to represent Sauk County in my Senate District. _x000D_
Sauk County is home to the Community Activated Recovery _x000D_
Enhancement (CARE) program. This is a program that could, _x000D_
potentially, be a statewide or even a nationwide model. There _x000D_
are several things we can do to help it be even better._x000D_
    In Sauk County in 2010, law enforcement and the medical _x000D_
community started noticing a growing problem. There were 20 _x000D_
heroin and opiate deaths in a 2-year period. Ambulance _x000D_
companies and first responders reported over 80 uses of Narcan, _x000D_
an opiate _x000D_
that--we have talked about that already._x000D_
    Law enforcement and the medical and legal community and _x000D_
local businesses--this is important, local businesses--joined _x000D_
together to address what they saw as a community crisis. They _x000D_
had the foresight to recognize that this problem could not be _x000D_
solved by law enforcement alone, and they knew they needed a _x000D_
more comprehensive approach, so they developed the CARE _x000D_
program._x000D_
    CARE is an integrated system, putting the individual at the _x000D_
center of their treatment, which empowers the individual to _x000D_
make better life choices. CARE recognizes that addiction can be _x000D_
treated and overcome using an integrated, multidisciplinary _x000D_
approach that requires medical treatment, mental health _x000D_
services, social services, and healthy support systems. It is a _x000D_
program that recognizes addiction is a disease, as the attorney _x000D_
general said. A lot of us used to see it the other way around, _x000D_
as somebody just choosing to do this. It is a disease, and as a _x000D_
speaker said earlier, it needs to be treated throughout the _x000D_
lifetime._x000D_
    It is an important piece of the CARE program is Vivitrol, a _x000D_
drug that we have heard about already, injected monthly and _x000D_
blocks the receptors in the brain responsible for an opiate _x000D_
high. Vivitrol is expensive. The average cost of a monthly shot _x000D_
is about 1,200 bucks._x000D_
    St. Vincent de Paul was the first to step in in Sauk _x000D_
Prairie to cover the cost for the drug for inmates who agreed _x000D_
to the program, but they could not afford it much longer._x000D_
    While enrolling inmates in the CARE program, Sauk County _x000D_
realized that Medicaid-eligible inmates leaving jail were _x000D_
experiencing a gap in coverage, jeopardizing their ability to _x000D_
continue to receive the shots. Wisconsin is a State that _x000D_
chooses to terminate rather than suspend Medicaid coverage for _x000D_
those who are incarcerated, and that needs to change._x000D_
    With us here, by the way, in the audience tonight from the _x000D_
UW-Extension is a member of the CARE team in Sauk County, Dr. _x000D_
Morgan McArthur, and he is a great resource for anybody on your _x000D_
committee who has any questions about the CARE program and how _x000D_
it is worked to this point._x000D_
    According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, _x000D_
at least 18 States currently suspend rather than terminate _x000D_
Medicaid coverage for people who are incarcerated. The _x000D_
suspension approach yields administrative savings related to _x000D_
reapplication eligibility determination process, which can take _x000D_
as long as 45 to 90 days._x000D_
    I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity, Mr. _x000D_
Chairman, to advocate for Wisconsin to take the Federal _x000D_
Medicaid Expansion dollars that have available to it through _x000D_
the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Our Legislative Fiscal Bureau _x000D_
estimates that Wisconsin is losing about $320 million over the _x000D_
biennium. 13.4 percent of the people in Wisconsin that would _x000D_
qualify for this Medicaid expansion have substance abuse _x000D_
disorders, 13.4 percent. So, needless to say, they could be _x000D_
helped by this._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, in order to confront this horrible epidemic _x000D_
head-on, in order to begin to win this fight, we must break _x000D_
down the barriers, we must change the way we look at addiction, _x000D_
and, again, treat it as a disease._x000D_
    And, on a personal note, we heard from Tyler and Ashleigh. _x000D_
Growing up in my family, my sisters, Mary and Kim, and I were _x000D_
Ashleigh. My brother, Will, was Tyler. We lost Will in January. _x000D_
He was 53 years old--lifelong battle with addiction. He used up _x000D_
until the day he died. He did not die of a single overdose. He _x000D_
just died of a lifetime of abuse. He was a brother, he was a _x000D_
son, and most importantly, he was a father. And, even being a _x000D_
father could not help him overcome this._x000D_
    And, I remember, Ashleigh talked about counseling. I _x000D_
remember the Erpenbachs going to family counseling in middle _x000D_
school and high school, and back then I had no idea why I was _x000D_
there. I was angry. I was really upset with my brother. I just _x000D_
wanted him to knock it off. And, there were days, in fact even _x000D_
months, when he would not use. But, when we would not see him _x000D_
for 2 or 3 days, or 2 or 3 weeks, or 2 or 3 months, we knew _x000D_
what was going on._x000D_
    I saw what it has done to my mom and dad. And, the one _x000D_
picture I will remember on the day he died, which was this past _x000D_
January, were two people approaching 80 years old, being _x000D_
married together probably close to 60 years now, hugging in a _x000D_
hallway of the hospital, turning and walking out. I am a dad. I _x000D_
cannot imagine that. I cannot imagine that whatsoever._x000D_
    We have a real serious problem, and it is threefold. It is _x000D_
the border issue, which is way above my pay grade, but it is _x000D_
also an issue how society sees drugs and addiction. And, it is _x000D_
not just drugs. It is addiction, period. It is gambling. _x000D_
Addiction takes on many forms, but the results are the same. It _x000D_
tears the individual apart, tears the family apart, tears the _x000D_
community apart, tears society apart._x000D_
    If you want to look at it as a dollars and cents figure--_x000D_
and this is the last thing I will say, and then I will be happy _x000D_
to answer questions--the amount of money taxpayers could save _x000D_
if we do this right would be tremendous, not only in Wisconsin, _x000D_
but certainly nationally._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924552,2924551,2924553,19235,6,"    Thank you, Senator Erpenbach._x000D_
    Sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that. Our _x000D_
final witness is Representative John Nygren. Representative _x000D_
Nygren was elected as a Wisconsin State Representative from the _x000D_
89th Assembly District in November 2006. Representative Nygren _x000D_
has made addressing the heroin-opiate epidemic in Wisconsin a _x000D_
major priority, leading the way in the passage of 17 bills by _x000D_
the Wisconsin legislature, 16 of which have been signed into _x000D_
law. And, again, a person of real courage to kind of lay bare _x000D_
your story for public scrutiny. So, we certainly appreciate _x000D_
your willingness to do so. Representative Nygren._x000D_
_x000D_
       TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE JOHN NYGREN,\1\ STATE _x000D_
        REPRESENTATIVE, DISTRICT 89, STATE OF WISCONSIN"
2924553,2924552,2924554,19235,6,"    Thank you, Senator Johnson and _x000D_
Senator Baldwin, for having a hearing today on the impact of _x000D_
trafficking and abuse of heroin and prescription opiates in _x000D_
Wisconsin._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Representative Nygren appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 91._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    It is already been said, our country is currently facing a _x000D_
prescription opiate and heroin epidemic. This problem knows no _x000D_
boundaries. All demographics of people are affected in one way _x000D_
or another, no matter their income, no matter their race, no _x000D_
matter whether they are from an urban community or a rural _x000D_
community. And, Senators, no matter if you are Republican, no _x000D_
matter if you are a Democrat._x000D_
    Many of us know too well that Wisconsin is not exempt from _x000D_
this epidemic. As mentioned, I have a daughter, Cassie, who is _x000D_
now 27 years old, who, unfortunately, to this day, is still _x000D_
struggling with addiction. Hers began with an illegally _x000D_
obtained prescription. We had a doctor selling prescriptions of _x000D_
OxyContin that, unfortunately, she got access to. When that _x000D_
supply dried up, she moved onto heroin, like many others._x000D_
    So, my family is no different--my community is no _x000D_
different. The county of Marinette led the State in overdose _x000D_
deaths per capita a couple years in a row. Initially, as an _x000D_
elected official--initially as a parent--we dealt with this _x000D_
problem, privately, like most would. But, when I began to read _x000D_
the obituaries of my friends' and neighbors' children, it was a _x000D_
call to action, and it was for that reason that I am very proud _x000D_
of the steps that the legislature in Wisconsin has taken over _x000D_
the past 3 years to combat this devastating problem in our _x000D_
State._x000D_
    In 2013, we laid the foundation of what was to become the _x000D_
Heroin Opiate Prevention and Education Agenda (HOPE). This _x000D_
foundation was laid with seven bills that aimed to fight _x000D_
heroin's use and addiction in our State._x000D_
    We expanded access to drug treatment opportunities; made _x000D_
opiate antagonists, like Narcan, more readily available to _x000D_
first responders; and enacted a Good Samaritan law. However, _x000D_
after the session ended, it was very clear that there was much _x000D_
more work to be done to combat our problem in Wisconsin._x000D_
    As this session began, we continued our work to build on _x000D_
the HOPE Agenda. Instead of specifically targeting heroin--_x000D_
heroin gets a lot of headlines, it is very dramatic and _x000D_
oftentimes has been talked about in the news, but it starts _x000D_
much more innocently in most cases. The root problem of our _x000D_
situation in Wisconsin has been readily agreed by many experts _x000D_
lies with prescription opiate misuse, abuse, and addiction._x000D_
    Studies show that in most cases, heroin addicts begin with _x000D_
an addiction to prescription painkillers. Whether these _x000D_
medications are obtained legally or not, we need to do our best _x000D_
to curtail the illegal use of these dangerous medications._x000D_
    As a continuation of the HOPE agenda, this session we _x000D_
passed 10 additional bills--9 of which have already been signed _x000D_
into law by Governor Walker. These bills continue to expand _x000D_
access to opiate antagonists to reduce incidents of overdose _x000D_
deaths, further expands access to treatment and diversion _x000D_
programs so people addicted to opiates can get the help they _x000D_
need in lieu of incarceration. And, we have expanded the use of _x000D_
Wisconsin's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), so _x000D_
instances of overprescribing become less common._x000D_
    It is our hope that these important pieces of legislation _x000D_
will reduce the number of people who become addicted to legal _x000D_
prescription opiates, and in turn, reduce the number of people _x000D_
who eventually turn to heroin and other dangerous substances._x000D_
     here are 17 HOPE Agenda bills total, and all of them were _x000D_
approved unanimously by both houses of the Wisconsin State _x000D_
Legislature. Governor Walker has signed 16 of these proposals _x000D_
into law, and we are expecting the 17th to be signed very soon._x000D_
    Once again, it is important to note, this is not a _x000D_
Republican issue, this is not a Democrat issue. When people _x000D_
contact my office to bare their soul about their personal _x000D_
stories, we never ask what their party affiliation is; but _x000D_
rather, this is a public health and safety issue._x000D_
    I am proud that there has been such widespread support for _x000D_
these pieces of legislation from people throughout our State, _x000D_
including the medical community, law enforcement, my colleagues _x000D_
in the legislature, the Governor, attorney general, and _x000D_
countless addiction advocates._x000D_
    Now it is time to start combating this devastating problem. _x000D_
I am proud that Wisconsin is leading the way with efforts like _x000D_
the HOPE Agenda and confident that other States will begin to _x000D_
look to us for guidance as far as what can be done._x000D_
    The laws that make up the HOPE Agenda are not a silver _x000D_
bullet that will solve this epidemic, but each proposal is an _x000D_
important step in the right direction. With that, I look _x000D_
forward to continuing our work to further build upon the HOPE _x000D_
Agenda in the future. Future efforts look to reduce current _x000D_
barriers to treatment, as well as provide additional access to _x000D_
treatment._x000D_
    I appreciate the opportunity to testify before your _x000D_
Committee today on the HOPE Agenda and the State of Wisconsin's _x000D_
efforts, and I hope to be able to be a resource for your work _x000D_
as we continue to address this problem nationally._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924554,2924553,2924555,19235,6,"    Thank you, Representative Nygren. We do _x000D_
have----"
2924555,2924554,2924556,19235,7,"    Sure, Mr. Chairman. I would _x000D_
separate out two things that General Kelly said. One is _x000D_
certainly the drugs that come across through the waterways in _x000D_
the Caribbean, et cetera. I think he is very clear that we have _x000D_
a lot more visibility on that than we have ever had, for a _x000D_
variety of reasons._x000D_
    Customs and Border Protection flies the Airborne Warning _x000D_
and Control System (AWACS). We do that in conjunction with our _x000D_
partners in the Coast Guard. We have an incredible center in _x000D_
the Joint Interagency Taskforce (JIATF) South in Key West, _x000D_
Florida and we have a lot of information, a lot of visibility, _x000D_
et cetera. What we do not have are the assets to go after that._x000D_
    Now, what we are talking about here mostly is cocaine, _x000D_
either destined for the United States, but frankly, given the _x000D_
appetite that Europe and Africa and others have for cocaine, _x000D_
this is cocaine going all the way across. It would be like when _x000D_
I was a police chief and we had a call of a robbery at a 7-_x000D_
Eleven, and I would say thank you for the information, but I do _x000D_
not have anybody to send. We could actually use more assets to _x000D_
be able to respond because we do have very good information, _x000D_
both technology and also informant information._x000D_
    On the other hand, the drugs that flow, and we are talking _x000D_
here mostly heroin, the drugs that flow into the United States _x000D_
from Mexico, again, speaking about heroin, is almost always _x000D_
interdicted through our ports of entry. We do not see many _x000D_
backpackers or others coming between the ports of entry, and _x000D_
when we do interdict drugs, it is almost always marijuana being _x000D_
done in those backpacks._x000D_
    So, it is coming through the ports of entry, whether it is _x000D_
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or the San Ysidro _x000D_
POE, and it is people that are carrying it on their person, it _x000D_
is people that have swallowed it, and it is hidden inside of _x000D_
vehicles, and of course our best deterrence to that has been _x000D_
able to interdict._x000D_
    I will tell you that I look at a lot of data, and I have _x000D_
seen that testimony and heard that testimony from General _x000D_
McCaffrey, who is a friend and a colleague and a mentor, but I _x000D_
would be very reluctant to cite to you the percentage of drugs _x000D_
that we either seize or do not seize. That being said, if we _x000D_
seized 50 percent or 70 percent, your earlier statement in the _x000D_
opening about our appetite for drugs and the fact that this is _x000D_
such a high profit area is going to make it extremely difficult _x000D_
if we seized 80 percent."
2924556,2924555,2924557,19235,7,"    I mean, the percentage is neither here _x000D_
nor there. The supply is meeting the demand and then some. To _x000D_
have the prices go from $3,000 a gram to $100 a gram, there is _x000D_
a real problem._x000D_
    Oftentimes we hear that the use of drugs is a victimless _x000D_
crime, and I think we have heard in testimony there is no such _x000D_
thing, the broken families, the broken lives. Again, these are _x000D_
the drug cartels, they are businesses. They expand their _x000D_
product line into human trafficking and sex trafficking._x000D_
    I do want you to speak to the brutality of these drug _x000D_
cartels, but I do want to talk a little bit about what we saw _x000D_
in Guatemala, where we visited a shelter--no address on it _x000D_
because they are trying to protect themselves from the drug _x000D_
cartels--the sex traffickers, but a shelter for sex-trafficked _x000D_
little girls. The youngest was 11, the oldest was probably _x000D_
about 16--average age is about 14--and they have cribs because _x000D_
they, obviously, get pregnant. So, anybody who thinks this is a _x000D_
victimless crime, go down to Guatemala and see just one sliver _x000D_
of that type of victimhood._x000D_
    But, again, you are on the front lines. You see the _x000D_
brutality. General Kelly was talking about anybody in public _x000D_
safety that would even begin to think of going up against the _x000D_
drug cartels, they get a little compact disc (CD) with their _x000D_
pictures of their family and their little girls. I mean, can _x000D_
you speak to what you know of why there is such impunity on the _x000D_
part of drug cartels, because they are simply untouchable _x000D_
because they are so brutal?"
2924557,2924556,2924558,19235,7,"    And, I think we are talking _x000D_
mostly then about Central America, because I have visited _x000D_
Guatamala. We certainly know the statistics in those three _x000D_
Central American countries, Honduras, El Salvador----"
2924558,2924557,2924559,19235,7,"    Well, Mexico is quite bad as well, is it _x000D_
not?"
2924559,2924558,2924560,19235,7,"    Well, although, actually, in the _x000D_
last year of President Calderon and continuing through _x000D_
President Pena, we have seen a decrease in their violent crime. _x000D_
It is still significantly higher than that of the United _x000D_
States._x000D_
    But, in those visits and in looking at that data, the level _x000D_
of violence, Honduras and El Salvador have homicide rates that _x000D_
oftentime top the world in the per capita killings, and I think _x000D_
that is what we have seen in the number of unaccompanied _x000D_
children (UAC) and others that have come across the border._x000D_
    But, it is driven by gang violence. And, I would go back _x000D_
and say that as much as the work that has been done by the _x000D_
Department of State (DOS), International Narcotics and Law _x000D_
Enforcement to provide rule of law training, to provide _x000D_
technology, to provide training for professional law _x000D_
enforcement, until, as Secretary John Kerry mentioned, in _x000D_
Davos, Switzerland, recently, until the corruption issue is _x000D_
addressed in these countries, you are not going to find people _x000D_
that are going to want to pick up and go to a local law _x000D_
enforcement official and say, I want to report something, I _x000D_
need help. So, I would say corruption drives part of this."
2924560,2924559,2924561,19235,7,"    But, can you talk about specifically the _x000D_
techniques the drug cartels use to gain the impunity with which _x000D_
they operate?"
2924561,2924560,2924562,19235,7,"    Well, I think they are going----"
2924562,2924561,2924563,19235,7,"    This is not just gang violence. I mean, _x000D_
this is a very dedicated effort on their part to be incredibly _x000D_
brutal against the family members of public safety officials, _x000D_
beheadings, those types of things."
2924563,2924562,2924564,19235,7,"    Yes, we have seen time after time _x000D_
after time, and including in Mexico, very high level law _x000D_
enforcement officials, many of whom have reputations that have _x000D_
been brought in to essentially improve things, to do public _x000D_
safety, they have been killed, their families have been killed. _x000D_
The mayor, just outside of the city of Mexico City, within the _x000D_
State of Mexico, was murdered only several days after her _x000D_
election. The intimidation and the threats to prosecutors, to _x000D_
law enforcement officials, et cetera._x000D_
    Which often then comes back to why in the United States we _x000D_
have not seen anywhere near that level of intimidation or _x000D_
violence. And, that is because, quite frankly, we have law _x000D_
enforcement officials that are not corrupt, we have prosecutors _x000D_
that will not back off from prosecuting, at the greatest and _x000D_
most severe level, people that would do that type of _x000D_
intimidation or threats._x000D_
    But, you are absolutely correct. The better things that _x000D_
would improve in those countries for safety, security, etc., _x000D_
the better we would be when it comes to our drug issue."
2924564,2924563,2924565,19235,7,"    So, my final point, and I will turn it _x000D_
over to Senator Baldwin, the breakdown of those public safety _x000D_
institutions, that impunity, that is driven by our insatiable _x000D_
demand for drugs, and it is important for us to recognize that. _x000D_
Senator Baldwin."
2924565,2924564,2924566,19235,7,"    Thank you. Commissioner, I want to hear _x000D_
you elaborate a little bit more about the pilot with regard to _x000D_
training your officers to administer naloxone._x000D_
    As I understand it, the beginning of Phase II _x000D_
implementation of that pilot is going to begin in the next _x000D_
couple of months. I would like to hear about when the initial _x000D_
pilot project will be complete and your thoughts about whether _x000D_
this pilot needs to be further expanded."
2924566,2924565,2924567,19235,7,    We should actually----
2924567,2924566,2924568,19235,7,"    Perhaps describe it, because many in the _x000D_
audience might not be familiar with it."
2924568,2924567,2924569,19235,7,"    When I served as the president's _x000D_
drug policy adviser starting in 2009, the issue of prescription _x000D_
drugs was known in the medical community; it was basically _x000D_
unknown anywhere else, unless people had been adversely _x000D_
affected. They knew about it, but frankly, you could count on _x000D_
one hand the number of articles about prescription drug _x000D_
overdoses. It is on the tip of everyone's tongue. It is _x000D_
knowledgeable. It is the subject of these hearings and many _x000D_
others. And so, one of the things that we saw very clearly was _x000D_
that if we can save people's lives, and, frankly, the first _x000D_
responders are often law enforcement, although the medical _x000D_
community does respond very quickly, the use of naloxone can _x000D_
reverse overdose._x000D_
    I think when the doctor testified about the concern that, _x000D_
well, naloxone is only going to encourage someone because they _x000D_
know they are not taking the chance, I also heard from the _x000D_
young woman at the end of the panel when she talked about, _x000D_
look, people cannot stop. If they could make a decision and _x000D_
say, you know what, I am going to quit, by heaven, I think they _x000D_
would have made that decision and quit._x000D_
    So, we wanted to see naloxone in the hands of every local _x000D_
law enforcement, State troopers, deputy sheriffs, and police _x000D_
officers, but we also wanted to see it in the hands of our _x000D_
people because we deal with a million people a day coming into _x000D_
the country._x000D_
    And, when I was in Boston this morning, they talked about _x000D_
people who were overdosing in the restroom of Boston Logan _x000D_
International Airport, and the State troopers there have _x000D_
naloxone and are able to use it. We need the same thing. I can _x000D_
assure you, Senator, that when the pilot is over, we will make _x000D_
sure that naloxone is at every one of our ports of entry."
2924569,2924568,2924570,19235,7,    Thank you.
2924570,2924569,2924571,19235,7,"    Again, Commissioner, thank you for your _x000D_
service to the country and thank you for coming again. Your _x000D_
dedication to these hearings on a local basis is really much _x000D_
appreciated, and thank you."
2924571,2924570,2924572,19235,7,    Thank you.
2924572,2924571,2924573,19235,8,"    So, it is down to three._x000D_
    General Schimel, you talked a little bit about the problem _x000D_
businesses are having. Coming from a manufacturing background _x000D_
myself, I can tell you that we have been drug testing, and as I _x000D_
have traveled around the State now and talked to manufacturers, _x000D_
who, cannot hire enough people, not one, for a variety of _x000D_
reasons._x000D_
    One of the reasons is that so many drug tests, 50 percent _x000D_
of people that come in for an application do not show up for _x000D_
the drug test--and these are just basic anecdotal percentages--_x000D_
another 50 percent that actually take it, fail. So, this is an _x000D_
enormously difficult problem._x000D_
    You talked a little bit about the purity. Does anybody on _x000D_
the panel really understand the issue of fentanyl now? Is that _x000D_
being blended with heroin? I mean, this is kind of a new drug _x000D_
on the scene in the last year and a half, correct?"
2924573,2924572,2924574,19235,8,"    Well, it is gained a lot more attention. It _x000D_
has been working its way through for some time now, but _x000D_
fentanyl is extraordinarily frightening because it is _x000D_
exponentially more powerful than heroin and exponentially more _x000D_
deadly, and when it is laced in with heroin, the user may not _x000D_
have any idea that it is in there."
2924574,2924573,2924575,19235,8,    What is the pricing of fentanyl?
2924575,2924574,2924576,19235,8,    I do not know the answer on that. I am sorry.
2924576,2924575,2924577,19235,8,"    Why would they lace that into heroin? If _x000D_
you are saying heroin now is so cheap, it can be so pure, why _x000D_
would they blend? Anybody know?"
2924577,2924576,2924578,19235,8,"    There is a competition for who has the best _x000D_
heroin, who has the drug that gets you the most high, that you _x000D_
can use the smallest amount to get to where you want to be. _x000D_
That is actually not a fair way to put it. I do not think they _x000D_
want to be there, but the place they need to be._x000D_
    As I have heard, many people who are in recovery from _x000D_
addiction--or are still struggling--talk about this, and once _x000D_
they progress very far into their addiction, they no longer get _x000D_
high. They simply are taking the drug to not get sick. There is _x000D_
not even the joy of feeling good from using it anymore. There _x000D_
is no joy left in their lives._x000D_
    So, by making the drug more powerful, they can maybe shoot _x000D_
past getting around being sick and still have some joy. It is _x000D_
incredibly dangerous, and we are seeing really shocking numbers _x000D_
of deaths from fentanyl."
2924578,2924577,2924579,19235,8,"    Do people take it on their own? And, is _x000D_
this injectable, is this snortable, or how is fentanyl _x000D_
administered?"
2924579,2924578,2924580,19235,8,"    Like the more potent heroin, you can take it _x000D_
in all the different manners now. That is one of the major _x000D_
differences, is several decades ago, with the 5 percent pure _x000D_
heroin, the only way to really get high was to shoot it up. _x000D_
Now, with the higher purity heroin, you can start by smoking it _x000D_
or snorting it, and that is less frightening a move than _x000D_
strapping a tourniquet around your arm and searching for a _x000D_
vein."
2924580,2924579,2924581,19235,8,"    You talked about methamphetamine. I think _x000D_
in your testimony you talked about it is really prevalent more _x000D_
on the western side of the State. Is that just simply a supply _x000D_
issue, that it is just more readily available through markets _x000D_
in Minneapolis or Minnesota?"
2924581,2924580,2924582,19235,8,"    It used to be very much a northwest phenomenon _x000D_
in our State. That has changed, and the southwestern part of _x000D_
our State is--law enforcement there is howling for help. _x000D_
Treatment providers there are very concerned about what they _x000D_
are seeing._x000D_
    Southeastern Wisconsin avoided it because there had always _x000D_
been a steady supply of cheap crack cocaine from the Chicago _x000D_
area, and that seemed to offset that demand. But, _x000D_
methamphetamine is on the move, and it is moving across our _x000D_
State. It will be everywhere soon."
2924582,2924581,2924583,19235,8,"    But, again, we used to manufacture here. _x000D_
You shut down those meth labs, and now it is just coming in, _x000D_
again, flowing freely into the United States from Mexico."
2924583,2924582,2924584,19235,8,"    The only kind of labs we have in the State _x000D_
anymore are what--we call them ``one pots,'' and it will be an _x000D_
individual who is cooking up enough for themselves and maybe a _x000D_
girlfriend or boyfriend, but that is it. No more commercial _x000D_
manufacturing."
2924584,2924583,2924585,19235,8,"    OK. Senator Erpenbach, you mentioned the _x000D_
drug Nivitrol. Can you tell me a little bit more what you know _x000D_
about that? You said the price is high. If it was more widely--_x000D_
--_x000D_
    So, if we administered more of it, would that price come _x000D_
down? I mean, could you just----"
2924585,2924584,2924586,19235,8,"    That I do not know. Not being a _x000D_
pharmacist, I can tell you that I have read that it blocks _x000D_
certain receptors that lead to the high. It is expensive _x000D_
because the pharmaceutical companies can make it that way, I _x000D_
guess. They can charge whatever it is they choose to charge._x000D_
    But, the point is, if somebody really, truly wants to make _x000D_
that step and has truly decided that, yes, I am done with _x000D_
drugs, we, as a community, need to be there for them. And, one _x000D_
of the ways we can be there is to try and make Vivitrol as _x000D_
prevalent as we possibly can to those who do need it._x000D_
    And, again, in the situation in Sauk County when they are _x000D_
identifying inmates who want to be part of this program and we _x000D_
have that gap coverage where Medicaid shuts off for people that _x000D_
we incarcerate in jails and then there is a wait to get back _x000D_
on, if they can get back on at all, that Vivitrol, that shot of _x000D_
Vivitrol, once they are out and they have made that decision to _x000D_
change their life, has to be available to them._x000D_
    Because if it is not, shortly after they are out, if they _x000D_
do not get the support they need, the help they need, and the _x000D_
community is not behind them and government is not behind them, _x000D_
they are going to end up right back in jail because they ended _x000D_
up stealing something because they needed the money to go out _x000D_
and buy some heroin or do whatever. I mean, that was the case _x000D_
with my brother."
2924586,2924585,2924587,19235,8,    Can I just----
2924587,2924586,2924588,19235,8,    Sure.
2924588,2924587,2924589,19235,8,"    So, I am one of those people who just _x000D_
learned a little bit more about this issue recently, and so, _x000D_
dangerous with the knowledge, but I had a chance to visit with _x000D_
participants in a Vivitrol program in Dane County, seven or _x000D_
eight people who were quite successfully being treated on the _x000D_
drug._x000D_
    It is particularly useful in that hand-off between jail and _x000D_
the community, because you have had to--and doctor, you can let _x000D_
me know if I have said anything incorrectly--but you had to _x000D_
have been free of opioid use for about 14 days beforehand. And _x000D_
so, reaching that 14 days is extremely challenging for addicts _x000D_
in the community. But, when you are in jail----"
2924589,2924588,2924590,19235,8,"    It is there. In my brother's situation, _x000D_
whether it was a county jail, Waupun, Green Bay, or _x000D_
Oshkosh--whatever prison he happened to be in, services, things _x000D_
that he needed, they were available. When he was out, they were _x000D_
not._x000D_
    And, it got to the point where, much like Tyler and _x000D_
Ashleigh's mom and dad basically saying to Tyler, you are out _x000D_
of here. I mean, we went through that process with my brother, _x000D_
Will. But, at the same time, you are still always holding out _x000D_
hope._x000D_
    So, as a community and as a government, whether we are _x000D_
State government officials or Federal Government officials, if _x000D_
there is funding available to help somebody who, again, has _x000D_
made that decision and they are transitioning out of a county _x000D_
jail, and we are saying, sorry, you do not qualify for this _x000D_
shot, good luck out there on the streets, we are going to see _x000D_
them right back there again._x000D_
    And, I ended my comments by saying, you want to talk _x000D_
dollars and cents, because a lot of us talk tough on taxes, you _x000D_
want to save money, you start investing in programs that work, _x000D_
and we will be saving a tremendous amount of money here in _x000D_
Wisconsin and nationally."
2924590,2924589,2924591,19235,8,"    Let us face it, it costs somewhere _x000D_
between $30,000 and $50,000 per year to incarcerate somebody. _x000D_
But, talking to the Lyberts, they thought that the one _x000D_
treatment for Tyler was about $78,000 worth."
2924591,2924590,2924592,19235,8,    About how much?
2924592,2924591,2924593,19235,8,"    About $78,000. And, when you hear the _x000D_
other--I do not know what the exact stats are, but one in 20, _x000D_
one in ten. I mean, that is part of the problem, is this is _x000D_
enormously expensive, unfortunately. So, 10 percent or 5 _x000D_
percent effective. I mean, it is one of those problems we have _x000D_
to be honest with, in terms of what is actually going to work. _x000D_
That is why something like Vivitrol, if it really blocks those _x000D_
receptors----"
2924593,2924592,2924594,19235,8,"    Yes. And, I know it is expensive, and I _x000D_
saw my parents write checks when I was growing up once _x000D_
insurance ran out, and I have seen other families go through it _x000D_
as well. But, again, there are programs out there that work, _x000D_
and that is what we need to invest in."
2924594,2924593,2924595,19235,8,"    And, that is what we need to explore, _x000D_
which is why I have the hearing._x000D_
    Representative Nygren, you did not really mention Cassie--_x000D_
other than just the name--in your testimony. You have talked _x000D_
about her. Would you be willing to share a little bit more of _x000D_
that experience before I turn it over to Senator Baldwin? _x000D_
Because it is these examples--it is that courage._x000D_
    And, by the way, my nephew overdosed a couple months _x000D_
ago--and the family wants to keep that private--I have a buddy _x000D_
that I played softball with, his daughter has been struggling _x000D_
with heroin for 5 years. He heard about this hearing, texted _x000D_
me, and said, ``Boy, use that as an example anonymously.''_x000D_
    So, I mean, I understand the problem and the pain, and this _x000D_
is very hard to make public, but, we have to address the demand _x000D_
side, we have to take the glamour out of it, and the way you _x000D_
take the glamour out of it is this kind of testimony--it is so _x000D_
powerful._x000D_
    So, if you do not want to, just tell me, I will turn it _x000D_
over to Senator Baldwin, but if you are willing to share, it is _x000D_
helpful and it is very powerful."
2924595,2924594,2924596,19235,8,"    Well, we have talked about it _x000D_
before. As I said, initially, families typically deal with this _x000D_
privately, especially when you are a little bit more in the _x000D_
spotlight--and besides, it was a private, personal issue, _x000D_
family issue._x000D_
    But, Cassie's involvement with drugs began with probably--I _x000D_
should not say probably, I know it first began with alcohol, _x000D_
then marijuana, and----"
2924596,2924595,2924597,19235,8,    Just at what age?
2924597,2924596,2924598,19235,8,"    Well, I would say alcohol, probably, _x000D_
but she did not like alcohol. That started probably around 13 _x000D_
and 14. Marijuana started around 15 or 16 and prescription _x000D_
drugs started around 17._x000D_
    Now, I mean, we have not really talked about the _x000D_
legalization of marijuana. That is one of those movements that _x000D_
is out there, and I know the attorney general has talked about _x000D_
this before, but there is people that will argue that marijuana _x000D_
is not a gateway drug, but I would argue that each of those are _x000D_
gateway drugs for some people._x000D_
    I grew up in the generation where a lot of people probably _x000D_
smoked marijuana, and those are the people in decisionmaking _x000D_
positions today, and they think, well, it did not affect us, so _x000D_
it would be OK to legalize it. But, as the attorney general, _x000D_
who has more knowledge on this, has talked about, we are _x000D_
talking about marijuana that is probably six or seven times _x000D_
stronger than what it was back in the 1970s."
2924598,2924597,2924599,19235,8,"    I think it is more than that, isn't it?"
2924599,2924598,2924600,19235,8,"    So, I mean, this is not your daddy's _x000D_
marijuana we are talking about, but----_x000D_
    So, that was kind of her progression. And, as a family, we _x000D_
went through all the--if you sat somebody--Lauri Badura or, _x000D_
somebody else who has had a loved one with an addiction right _x000D_
next to me, we could probably tell a pretty similar story. Tell _x000D_
you a story about robberies in your home, or break-ins in your _x000D_
home, missing dollars, missing valuables, those type of things, _x000D_
things that began to disappear. All those things were difficult _x000D_
as a family._x000D_
    Seeing somebody who was once a straight-A student not _x000D_
graduate from high school was difficult. Seeing her eventually, _x000D_
in orange in county jail or eventually prison was difficult._x000D_
    But, the most difficult thing as a parent was when they are _x000D_
in active addiction, waiting for that phone call to come. That _x000D_
phone call came for me. I got there, was able to try to help _x000D_
her breathe until the paramedics arrived and administered _x000D_
Narcan. If it would have been the basic-level emergency medical _x000D_
technicians (EMTs) in Marinette, they could not administer _x000D_
Narcan at that point in time; we have changed that. But, _x000D_
waiting for that to happen. She has an opportunity today to _x000D_
lead the life that we dreamed for her. Unfortunately, she is _x000D_
still struggling._x000D_
    But, Tyler mentioned it earlier, there is a certain amount _x000D_
of guilt when you talk about this, because it is difficult for _x000D_
me to talk to--dramatically about the challenges my family has _x000D_
faced when I know of so many others who their children do not _x000D_
have that opportunity for hope."
2924600,2924599,2924601,19235,8,    They are gone.
2924601,2924600,2924602,19235,8,"    They are gone. So, I try to be that _x000D_
voice for them. There is so many people working very hard on _x000D_
this issue throughout our State. It was talked earlier that we _x000D_
all need to work together, and we do._x000D_
    We tried to create a website recently to try and bring all _x000D_
those different links, all those different resources together, _x000D_
HOPE Agenda website, but there is so many people trying, and I _x000D_
do believe we are making progress, but there is so much more _x000D_
work that needs to be, and for Cassie there is a lot of work _x000D_
that needs to be done as well."
2924602,2924601,2924603,19235,8,"    God bless you and her, and we, obviously, _x000D_
are praying for her._x000D_
    First of all, thank you for sharing that, and thank you for _x000D_
all your efforts._x000D_
    And, with that, Senator Baldwin."
2924603,2924602,2924604,19235,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Attorney General, I would like to hear your thoughts on the _x000D_
_x000D_
most pressing gaps that still exist. Your testimony you talked _x000D_
about--well, you gave a real strong voice to the need to have, _x000D_
basically, a seamless interaction between law enforcement and _x000D_
public health systems in order to tackle this emergency. Your _x000D_
expertise, of course, is on the law enforcement side, but you _x000D_
have seen both._x000D_
    You talked about the fact that the Edward Byrne Memorial _x000D_
Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) program keeps shrinking, you _x000D_
talked about the treatment courts and the fact that new _x000D_
counties are unlikely to start them if there is not a Federal _x000D_
contribution, and you talked about the importance of innovation _x000D_
that is happening around this State, that competitive grant _x000D_
programs would also be of great importance._x000D_
    As well as I do, about the fiscal constraints we face _x000D_
nationally, statewide, but where do you see the most profound _x000D_
gaps that would benefit from greater Federal attention to _x000D_
better grapple with this emergency and acknowledging it is a _x000D_
crisis and an emergency?"
2924604,2924603,2924605,19235,8,"    The biggest future challenge we face is going _x000D_
to be availability of treatment resources. It is now already. _x000D_
But, as we have great collaboration with our medical community _x000D_
in Wisconsin, and as a result, combining that with some law _x000D_
changes, we are going to see prescribing of opioids decrease, _x000D_
and probably dramatically. That is going to limit the amount of _x000D_
prescription narcotics that are available for diversion and _x000D_
abuse, and those who are already addicted are going to turn to _x000D_
heroin then._x000D_
    Numbers from 2013 already suggested then 163,000 people in _x000D_
Wisconsin were abusing opiates in some manner. We cannot treat _x000D_
those. We cannot treat that many. We cannot even come close. We _x000D_
are going to have to be prepared for that._x000D_
    It is something that I am very proud of our medical _x000D_
community in Wisconsin, because they get this, and they are _x000D_
working on it. They are working to change education for _x000D_
doctors, they are working to change the conversation between _x000D_
doctors and patients, and they are working to make sure there _x000D_
are more Suboxone providers._x000D_
    One of the things we could do is address right now what _x000D_
many assert is an artificial limit for the number of patients _x000D_
that a Suboxone-certified doctor can see."
2924605,2924604,2924606,19235,8,    Yes.
2924606,2924605,2924607,19235,8,"    They can see more, and many recommend that we _x000D_
eliminate those artificial limits, or at least raise them, _x000D_
because Suboxone will be--and as Tyler Lybert described, not _x000D_
every kind of treatment works for everybody, it is all _x000D_
different, but we need to have it available, and that does work _x000D_
for many people as a support while they are also getting _x000D_
treatment._x000D_
    These are medication-assisted treatment; it is important to _x000D_
remember that. It still will always circle back. But, we can _x000D_
stretch our treatment capabilities if we have the medication _x000D_
assisting someone in getting through treatment as well. I _x000D_
believe treatment providers can serve more people if their _x000D_
patients are stabilized with some kind of medication _x000D_
assistance. And, prevention dollars are so important._x000D_
    And, I want to expand a little bit on drug treatment _x000D_
courts. In Waukesha County, our drug treatment court costs _x000D_
about $2,700 a year to have an individual in that court. That _x000D_
included all of their treatment, drug testing, case management, _x000D_
constant trips to court. Did I say drug testing? I meant to. _x000D_
Everything. They did not have to come up with any money to be _x000D_
in the program. $2,700, I cannot keep somebody in the county _x000D_
jail for 3 months. $2,700, I cannot keep them in the State _x000D_
prison for one month. $2,700 will not pay for an autopsy and _x000D_
the toxicology reports that are necessary._x000D_
    All of the people that enter into the drug treatment courts _x000D_
in our State are coming there with two destinations that were _x000D_
awaiting them otherwise. They were either going to overdose and _x000D_
die, or they were heading to prison, and drug treatment courts _x000D_
are interfering with that path, and it is the best thing we're _x000D_
doing."
2924607,2924606,2924608,19235,8,"    One quick additional question. As you have _x000D_
taken a journey from being the head law enforcement official in _x000D_
this county, to a statewide perspective, I have also gone from _x000D_
representing a part of the State to representing the whole _x000D_
State, are there any geographical gaps that you would want to _x000D_
bring to my attention? I know I get calls from constituents who _x000D_
talk about the distances that they need to travel to seek _x000D_
treatment, to seek support, to seek help."
2924608,2924607,2924609,19235,8,"    Treatment resources are taxed severely _x000D_
everywhere, but in the more rural communities, it is most _x000D_
profound. People sometimes have to travel a hundred miles or _x000D_
more to get to a treatment provider, and many of these _x000D_
individuals do not have money left to have a reliable car. They _x000D_
may have----"
2924609,2924608,2924610,19235,8,"    They may not have a license._x000D_
long time ago, and there is certainly no bus._x000D_
    We are seeing innovations in the treatment community, where _x000D_
treatment providers are utilizing videoconferencing for it, and _x000D_
I am told by treatment providers that it is demonstrated to be _x000D_
as effective or can be as effective as in-person treatment _x000D_
provided, but it needs to be--the person receiving that _x000D_
videoconferencing should be in some kind of a medical facility _x000D_
where they can get help and advice face-to-face as well._x000D_
    But, these are some of the things that we are attempting to _x000D_
do to expand these resources to meet a demand that, frankly, we _x000D_
hope will become overwhelming. We hope that these tens of _x000D_
thousands of people that need to be in treatment, we are hoping _x000D_
that more and more of them will be ready to accept treatment."
2924610,2924609,2924611,19235,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
     Senator Erpenbach, I want to continue this discussion _x000D_
about the nexus between law enforcement and public health and _x000D_
care and treatment for those with addiction based on your _x000D_
testimony about the incredible work that is being done in Sauk _x000D_
County._x000D_
    You talked a little bit about some of the treatment that _x000D_
begins in jail and how there are often interruptions when a _x000D_
person leaves and tries to seek that same treatment in the _x000D_
community. I think the Vivitrol example is a key example. How _x000D_
is the treatment funded when it is offered in a jail setting? _x000D_
How is it not being covered when it becomes an issue of _x000D_
community treatment for the profile of people who are needing _x000D_
it?"
2924611,2924610,2924612,19235,8,"    Well, I do know that in Sauk County, _x000D_
with St. Vincent de Paul, who first stepped up and started _x000D_
paying for it, and, obviously, they cannot afford it, they have _x000D_
had about 30 people who have gone through the CARE program and _x000D_
gone through it successfully. And, obviously, you identify who _x000D_
would be good candidates while people are serving their time in _x000D_
Sauk County Jail._x000D_
    And, again, if we, as a State, decided to suspend, as _x000D_
opposed to terminate, Medicaid services for folks who are _x000D_
sitting in county jails, that would go a long way. That would _x000D_
be a very first good step._x000D_
    The next step, again, would be, in my opinion, to taking _x000D_
the Medicaid expansion, because somebody who is making minimum _x000D_
wage is not eligible for BadgerCare in Wisconsin, and there is _x000D_
13 percent of those who would be eligible from the 100 percent _x000D_
to the 138, 13 percent of those or so who have addiction-_x000D_
related issues that are costing society and their families and _x000D_
themselves ultimately, in many cases the ultimate in their _x000D_
death, when they die._x000D_
    So, one thing we should do in Wisconsin, and, I am going to _x000D_
talk with Representative Nygren about this at some point when _x000D_
we head into the next session, is what we can do in working _x000D_
with DHS to just suspend, not terminate, those services for _x000D_
those folks who lose their Medicaid eligibility."
2924612,2924611,2924613,19235,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Representative Nygren, I just want to commend you on your _x000D_
work on the HOPE Agenda, the work that we have talked about, in _x000D_
terms of coordinating at the State and Federal level. I would _x000D_
love it if you could spend a few moments further talking about _x000D_
the agenda pieces that improve access to Narcan, or naloxone, _x000D_
and whether you are already hearing any feedback about how _x000D_
those are working in communities across the State."
2924613,2924612,2924614,19235,8,"    Sure. So, you know what, we in _x000D_
Wisconsin, I think we are a true citizen legislature. We all _x000D_
bring different experiences to the table. My background in _x000D_
insurance, finance, the restaurant business, as a small _x000D_
business owner--so I kind of thought that would be my area of _x000D_
expertise, but God had a different plan in addition to that, _x000D_
having a daughter with an addiction. So, a lot of the _x000D_
experiences that I have already went through with Cassie have _x000D_
enabled us to turn some of those experiences into legislation._x000D_
    So, the day that we got that phone call and we found her _x000D_
purple, struggling to breathe, needle in her arm, and I tried _x000D_
to help her breathe until the paramedics arrived--or EMTs. _x000D_
Marinette we have both basic-level EMTs, who are emergency _x000D_
rescue squad, which is all volunteer; and we have paramedics _x000D_
assigned to Bay Area Medical Center._x000D_
    The paramedics showed up first. I did not know the _x000D_
difference, necessarily. But, they administered naloxone and _x000D_
brought her back to life. So, that experience began to get me _x000D_
thinking about it. It is like, well, what happens if I am in a _x000D_
rural area, and it is a police officer that shows up first? At _x000D_
that time, basic-level EMTs, the rescue squad folks, or police _x000D_
and fire, unless they have advanced EMT training, did not have _x000D_
the ability to carry and administer naloxone. So, we changed _x000D_
that._x000D_
    In addition to that, this session we also expanded access _x000D_
to naloxone through what is called a standing order. There are _x000D_
a number of pharmacies, Walgreens, CVS, Aurora in our State _x000D_
that are allowing for naloxone to be purchased with some simple _x000D_
training through what is called a standing order with the local _x000D_
pharmacist._x000D_
    There is not a lot of data yet on that, but I have been _x000D_
kind of pushing my folks in the administration, my staff, to _x000D_
try and get data on that first piece. And, I can tell you that _x000D_
we recently got a graph, actually an outline of the State of _x000D_
Wisconsin, showing the number of administrations of naloxone _x000D_
during the last year. And, the total was, I believe, nearly _x000D_
4,000._x000D_
    So, you know that oftentimes we pass legislation that we do _x000D_
not necessarily know or have a good idea of what the immediate _x000D_
effects are, but it has been argued by some that putting _x000D_
naloxone into more hands enables that behavior. The objective _x000D_
here is getting more people in recovery so they can be _x000D_
productive, tax-paying citizens living the American dream. _x000D_
Sorry for that, spouting that ideal. Well, they cannot do that, _x000D_
they cannot recover, they cannot get into recovery if they are _x000D_
dead. So, the more access to that, the better."
2924614,2924613,2924615,19235,8,    Thank you.
2924615,2924614,2924616,19235,8,"    Would you like to just do a closing _x000D_
statement, because people have been very patient. So, just have _x000D_
a couple closing comments before we close out the hearing?"
2924616,2924615,2924617,19235,8,"    I just think it has been an extraordinary _x000D_
opportunity to hear from Wisconsinites who tackle this issue _x000D_
from various perspectives, some having faced tragedy. Frankly, _x000D_
even those who were coming to speak because of the office they _x000D_
held--everybody has a personal experience with this._x000D_
    But, we have an extraordinary amount of education due to _x000D_
make everyone aware that this is an epidemic, that this is an _x000D_
emergency. And, I think that the better job we can do of _x000D_
understanding the root causes from cartels in Central America _x000D_
to well-intentioned physicians and prescribers in communities _x000D_
across America, who are just trying to alleviate pain, but are _x000D_
not prescribing in manners that are safe, with the guidance _x000D_
they need, once we understand that, we can do a much better _x000D_
job, and I think we are with these State leaders, we are moving _x000D_
in the right direction. But, boy, this epidemic is far ahead of _x000D_
us right now, and we need to catch up, and we need to do it _x000D_
fast._x000D_
    Thank you again. Thank you to the audience members who sat _x000D_
through--I suspect everyone in here is here because you have a _x000D_
passionate belief in getting this right. So, thank you for that _x000D_
time and attention and any help you can give us to get the job _x000D_
done._x000D_
    And, Chairman Johnson, thank you for having this hearing."
2924617,2924616,2924618,19235,8,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I am an accountant. I got some numbers. Let me just run a _x000D_
couple numbers by before I do my closing statements._x000D_
    What we are witnessing here, obviously, are tragedies to _x000D_
individuals and to families, and what we are seeing here is, I _x000D_
think, some pretty extraordinary, but I would say probably not _x000D_
uncommon, cooperation at the local and State level, trying to _x000D_
grapple with a very difficult problem._x000D_
    One of the issues we have, when we talk about funding, is _x000D_
there are always limited resources. Just so you understand, on _x000D_
a Federal Government level, for fiscal year 2016, we will spend _x000D_
about $30 billion on the war on drugs, about half of it on the _x000D_
demand side, half of it on the supply side._x000D_
    This hearing is just one in a series, and one of the things _x000D_
we will definitely do is try and delve into that $30 billion _x000D_
that we spend and see if there a better way to deploy it. Are _x000D_
we better off, rather than spending $30,000 or $50,000 per _x000D_
prisoner, looking at using that in terms of treatment? But, _x000D_
again, the treatment costs are high, and we just really do have _x000D_
to really figure out a better way of addressing these problems._x000D_
    It is very complex. There is the supply side, there is the _x000D_
demand side, there is the treatment side. From the Federal _x000D_
Government's standpoint, we do need to concentrate on that _x000D_
supply side, and, the fact that we do not have those secure _x000D_
borders, the fact we have those drug cartels creating such _x000D_
barbarity and evil in the world. I mean, we definitely have to _x000D_
address that. And so, we will do that._x000D_
    But, again, I commend you folks for working together in a _x000D_
very bipartisan fashion. I commend you for taking the time to _x000D_
be here today. Hopefully, the public does take a look at this _x000D_
and go, it is possible, we do do it, we do like each other, we _x000D_
do try and work together, and the approach to be used is try _x000D_
and find areas of agreement._x000D_
    There are plenty of things that divide us. I mean, even in _x000D_
this hearing, there are some differences, no doubt about it, _x000D_
but we are all human beings. There is no one political party _x000D_
that has a monopoly on compassion. We want to solve these _x000D_
problems. If we concentrate on those areas of agreement, it is _x000D_
just a whole lot easier finding common ground._x000D_
    And, if you will indulge me for 2 seconds. I was not going _x000D_
to do this, but prior to this hearing, my wife did reach out to _x000D_
her brother and got a text. And, I did not want to bring in _x000D_
anything like that, but I just have to read some--there is a _x000D_
text with probably about 20 different lines in it._x000D_
    Talking about the autopsy report, ``he could not read it. _x000D_
Too sad. I am still crying. Just tears to me now, big tears''._x000D_
    That is what is affecting people's lives, these tragedies _x000D_
on an individual basis._x000D_
    So, again, Senator Baldwin, thank you for your involvement _x000D_
in this issue, things you are trying to work on. Gentlemen, _x000D_
thank you for what you are doing. Again, the audience members, _x000D_
you are probably here because you have been touched, you have _x000D_
been affected by this._x000D_
    This is not going to end. This is a big problem, it is a _x000D_
complex problem, many components to it. But, if we work _x000D_
together, if we concentrate on areas of agreement, the shared _x000D_
goal of trying to rid this country, quite honestly this world, _x000D_
of this scourge, we just might start finding some commonality._x000D_
    So, with that, let us close it out. The hearing record will _x000D_
remain open for 15 days, until April 30 at 5 p.m., for the _x000D_
submission of statements and questions for the record._x000D_
    Thank you all. This hearing is adjourned."
2924618,2924617,2924619,19235,11,"    Good morning. My name is Dr. Dan Simon. I am the _x000D_
president of University Hospitals (UH) Case Medical Center. _x000D_
Welcome to Ohio and to the flagship hospital of the University _x000D_
Hospitals system._x000D_
    On behalf of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tom Zenty, _x000D_
our senior leaders, our 26,000 doctors, nurses and employees _x000D_
and the community we serve, we are honored to host this _x000D_
important hearing._x000D_
    We are grateful to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland _x000D_
Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) for confronting the _x000D_
opioid crisis._x000D_
    I would like to thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper for their leadership on the Committee and their staffs _x000D_
for being here this morning._x000D_
    I would also like to thank our fine Ohio Senators Sherrod _x000D_
Brown and Rob Portman for honorably representing Ohioans in _x000D_
Washington._x000D_
    We were privileged to host Senator Portman for a round _x000D_
table event last January to discuss his legislation, the _x000D_
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). We are pleased _x000D_
that it passed the Senate and hope for speedy consideration in _x000D_
the House._x000D_
    Thank you for your strong leadership on a very complicated _x000D_
issue._x000D_
    Now I would like to turn things over to Senator Portman._x000D_
_x000D_
            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PORTMAN\1\"
2924619,2924618,2924620,19235,11,"    Dan, thank you very much. I appreciate _x000D_
that. And, I am now going to officially call this hearing to _x000D_
order._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Portman appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 139._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I appreciate everybody being here. This is a distinguished _x000D_
group of Cleveland area citizens and a really distinguished _x000D_
panel, two panels, in fact. We look forward to hearing from _x000D_
them in a moment._x000D_
    This is a critical hearing, because it is an opportunity to _x000D_
draw attention to an issue that all of us face in the State and _x000D_
in our country, which is this epidemic of opioid addiction and _x000D_
overdose prescription drugs and heroin._x000D_
    It has devastated communities here in Ohio. It has torn _x000D_
families apart. But, this is happening all over the country._x000D_
    And, as we will talk about in a moment, the fact that our _x000D_
legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act _x000D_
passed with a 94 to 1 vote in the United States Senate, which _x000D_
never happens, which is evidence of that. I do look forward to _x000D_
the expert testimony we are going to receive today._x000D_
    And, Dan is right, I was here in this very room in a round _x000D_
table discussion where I learned about some of the expertise _x000D_
that resides right here at University Hospital and also at our _x000D_
other great medical institutions in town. And so, we thought _x000D_
this would be an appropriate place to hold this hearing._x000D_
    It also happens to be a beautiful room for a hearing. You _x000D_
may find many Congressional hearings now coming to this room."
2924620,2924619,2924621,19235,13,"    They never let you in._x000D_
discussions and past conferences. But, it took the other guy to _x000D_
come in town to get the use of this room. So, thank you, I _x000D_
appreciate that._x000D_
    And, I thank Senator Portman to allow me to be at this _x000D_
hearing. Because I do not sit on this Committee in Washington. _x000D_
And so, I am kind of an honorary member or something today _x000D_
sitting in. So, thank you for that._x000D_
    And, to Senators Carper and Johnson and their staffs, thank _x000D_
you for arranging this, for the room and the witnesses, and the _x000D_
second panel especially too._x000D_
    Rob talked about this upcoming a couple of times. And, if _x000D_
you look out this window, you will see zip codes that have some _x000D_
of the highest infant mortality rates in the country, and _x000D_
certainly in the State and maybe in the country._x000D_
    You will see some of the highest foreclosure rates in the _x000D_
country. The zip code my wife and I live in, 44105, south of _x000D_
Slavic Village, had more foreclosures than any zip code in the _x000D_
United States of America in 2007._x000D_
    So, this is a public health crisis--opioid addiction--as so _x000D_
many of these other things are--and how related they are._x000D_
    As Senator Portman pointed out, this is not a city problem, _x000D_
this opioid addiction._x000D_
    I first started hearing a lot about this when I came to the _x000D_
Senate in 2007, and especially in places like Adams and Brown _x000D_
County of the Ohio River. Attorney General DeWine has been _x000D_
working on this a long time, a lot of us have._x000D_
    And, it started off with Oxycontin and oxycodone and _x000D_
Percocet and Vicodin and legally prescribed drugs. And, it has _x000D_
spread obviously._x000D_
    And, we know that addiction--when you think about _x000D_
addiction, and you think about the biases and the prejudices _x000D_
people have about addiction, years ago addiction, when it was _x000D_
confined to certain areas and certain cities, look out this _x000D_
windows, it was considered a character flaw or it was _x000D_
considered an individual problem. We know it is not._x000D_
    We know addiction is--some people are just more predisposed _x000D_
toward addiction than others. We know it is not a character _x000D_
flaw. It is not a personal problem. It is an illness. And, it _x000D_
is a chronic disease. And, that is why this hearing is so very _x000D_
important._x000D_
    Fundamentally--and I want to thank the people. I did not do _x000D_
this. I thank the people in this room who are some of the best _x000D_
activists, as Rob has pointed out, some of the best activists _x000D_
in our State fighting against this._x000D_
    The numbers are just overwhelming. The availability is _x000D_
amazing. I have done, as Rob said--and he has, too--I have done _x000D_
round tables, town halls all over the State._x000D_
    I remember one in Southern Ohio. I said, how easy is it to _x000D_
get heroin? They said, you know where the McDonald's is out on _x000D_
Route 23? I said, yes. They said, go out there. Walk around for _x000D_
3 minutes, and you will be able to buy some._x000D_
    We know what a round table I did in the Mahoning Valley--_x000D_
the Youngstown area. A woman, affluent, she said because of the _x000D_
money her family had, they could keep their son alive._x000D_
    He was addicted at 14, because he went into the--I think, _x000D_
if I recall, they were taking care of their grandmother, as I _x000D_
did with home care and my brothers did some 10 years ago in _x000D_
Mansfield. And, there was morphine in the cabinet, because they _x000D_
were helping her be comfortable in her last months or last _x000D_
weeks and even last days. And, their 12--14 year old son began _x000D_
to take the morphine. And, he has been addicted in and out _x000D_
treatment for 12 years._x000D_
    And, she talked about the family is just turned upside _x000D_
down, because this son has siblings. And, they are not getting _x000D_
the attention that they deserve and they demand and the parents _x000D_
and all the things that happen._x000D_
    So, we know how excruciating this is in every city, county, _x000D_
inner-ring suburb, more far flung suburbs, every county in the _x000D_
State. And, that is the importance of what we do._x000D_
    But, the other thing that really came through to me on this _x000D_
is how every community is crying out for dollars to help us on _x000D_
this. And, we cannot get Congress to--neither the State nor the _x000D_
Federal Government has come up even close to the dollars we _x000D_
need to scale out these programs._x000D_
    Almost every community in the State, people have come _x000D_
together. They are very good, as Rob said earlier today, they _x000D_
are very good not for profits. They are very good county-_x000D_
funded--all the different ways we fund treatment. Those exist. _x000D_
But, none of them can scale up without a lot of help from _x000D_
Columbus and Washington._x000D_
    And, when you think--because nobody predicted this opioid _x000D_
epidemic to explode the way it did. So, no community is _x000D_
prepared to scale out. It just does not have the resources to _x000D_
do that._x000D_
    And, that is where we come in. CARA, the work that Rob has _x000D_
done, is very important and impressive with CARA. We need to _x000D_
get it through the House. He is working on that. We are all _x000D_
working on that._x000D_
    We also though need Senator McConnell to begin to support _x000D_
much better funding. And, we need the Governor and the _x000D_
legislature to support much better funding. You just cannot do _x000D_
this on the cheap._x000D_
    The reason though I am optimistic is, I have seen what our _x000D_
country has done in public health for generations. So, it was _x000D_
our country that led the eradication of small pox, where _x000D_
hundreds of millions of people in the 20th Century died of _x000D_
small pox. It is pretty much eradicated._x000D_
    Look what we did with polio in the 1940s to 1950s--1930s, _x000D_
1940s, and 1950s to eradicate polio in this country and most _x000D_
places around the world, almost every place. What we did with _x000D_
Ebola 2 years ago. When the alarmists in our country said, _x000D_
``thousands of people are going to die from Ebola.'' Well, do _x000D_
you know how many people died from Ebola--contracted in the _x000D_
United States and died here? Zero._x000D_
    We are facing the public health threat of the Zika virus _x000D_
now. We are accelerating the research for vaccine and an _x000D_
antiviral for cure, for vaccine and cure. And, this is, at _x000D_
least for us in this State, an even bigger public health threat _x000D_
with opioid addiction._x000D_
    So, we have risen to the occasion as a community, as a _x000D_
Nation. I think we will today. This hearing that Senator _x000D_
Portman called is a step toward that. Thank you."
2924621,2924620,2924622,19235,13,"    Thank you, Sherrod, great points._x000D_
    We will now go to our first panel. And, we are going to _x000D_
discuss here the Federal, State and local collaboration to _x000D_
combat opioid addiction. We have three really distinguished _x000D_
panelists._x000D_
    First, we are going to hear from Attorney General Mike _x000D_
DeWine. As I said earlier, Mike DeWine has been a leader on _x000D_
this issue, not just focusing on the law enforcement side of _x000D_
it, which you might expect from an attorney general, but also _x000D_
on the prevention side and the community outreach. He is also _x000D_
going to talk about fentanyl and his effort to prevent drug _x000D_
abuse._x000D_
    Next, we are going to hear from Carole Rendon. Carole is _x000D_
the acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. _x000D_
She's gone well beyond the call of duty to actually lead the _x000D_
task force here in Cleveland on opioid addiction. And, I thank _x000D_
her for that and her continued passion._x000D_
    She is going to talk about strengthening partnerships _x000D_
across government to address this problem in her role as part _x000D_
of the task force._x000D_
    Finally, we are going to hear from Tracy Plouck. Tracy is _x000D_
the director of the Ohio Department of Mental Health and _x000D_
Addiction Services (MHAS). She was a key resource as we _x000D_
developed CARA, as you can imagine, as one of those people I _x000D_
talked about earlier from Ohio who actually gets it and has a _x000D_
lot of expertise on the ground._x000D_
    She is going to talk about what the State has done to _x000D_
expand addiction treatment, including efforts to respond to the _x000D_
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) we talked about earlier, the _x000D_
addicted babies._x000D_
    So, with that, I would ask all three witnesses if they are _x000D_
willing to stand, please, we can swear you in._x000D_
    Please raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony _x000D_
you will give before this Committee will be the truth, the _x000D_
whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?"
2924622,2924621,2924623,19235,13,    I do.
2924623,2924622,2924624,19235,13,    I do.
2924624,2924623,2924625,19235,13,    I do.
2924625,2924624,2924626,19235,13,"    Excellent. Let the record show that the _x000D_
witnesses all answered in the affirmative. And, with that, _x000D_
again thank all three of you for being here._x000D_
    And, Attorney General DeWine, thank you for your passion _x000D_
and expertise on this issue. We would like to hear from you._x000D_
_x000D_
   TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE R. MICHAEL DEWINE,\1\ ATTORNEY _x000D_
                     GENERAL, STATE OF OHIO"
2924626,2924625,2924627,19235,13,"    Mr. Chairman and Senator Brown, thank you for--_x000D_
not just for doing this hearing today, but thank you for your _x000D_
long time focus on this particular issue. You have traveled the _x000D_
State, both of you have traveled the State extensively and _x000D_
really I think understand what this problem is all about._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. DeWine appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 148._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    You mentioned, Chairman, about fentanyl. There is just one _x000D_
statistic. In 2015, in our crime lab, it was brought in to us _x000D_
and we dealt with, the amount of fentanyl that year was--_x000D_
exceeded what it was in our labs for five previous years _x000D_
combined. And, this year, 2016, we are seeing it go straight up _x000D_
as well. So, there is absolutely no change in that._x000D_
    The number of deaths, we all cite statistics. I do not _x000D_
think we know exactly how many people we are losing in Ohio. I _x000D_
would simply say this. That if it was not for naloxone and _x000D_
Narcan, those numbers would just be much worse._x000D_
    And, what that tells you though I think is it is not just _x000D_
the deaths. It is the families that are destroyed, the moms and _x000D_
dads who get up every day and worry about their kid all day _x000D_
long, because their child is now in the 22nd day of recovery, _x000D_
and they do not know how long that that is going to last._x000D_
    You are absolutely correct, this is a very different drug _x000D_
epidemic. I started looking at the drug problem when I was an _x000D_
assistant prosecuting attorney in the 1970s. This is very _x000D_
different. It is everywhere. It is the rural areas, cities, and _x000D_
suburbs. The face of heroin is really the face of the State of _x000D_
Ohio. And, it does cover every single demographic group._x000D_
    I do not really know why we are seeing this huge problem. _x000D_
But, I will note two things that I think are significant that _x000D_
have come together._x000D_
    First of all, the marketing of heroin is fundamentally _x000D_
different than it has ever been before. They are much more _x000D_
sophisticated. It is much more user friendly or consumer _x000D_
friendly._x000D_
    Poppies are grown generally in Mexico. The heroin is made, _x000D_
processed in Mexico. It comes across our Southern border. It _x000D_
comes into Ohio and other States._x000D_
    And, the groups that are selling it really use what I call _x000D_
the pizza delivery system. It is very similar. The price is _x000D_
about the same, and you can get it just about as quickly as you _x000D_
can get a pizza. It is $10. It is $15. Sometimes they will give _x000D_
it away, because they want to get someone hooked._x000D_
    It is a perfect business model, because you start off at _x000D_
this level of heroin for $15 a day. In 6 months or a year, you _x000D_
may be clear up here. Some doctors have told me the ratio could _x000D_
be as high as 100 to 1. So, what starts as a $15 a day habit _x000D_
can be a $1,500 a day habit._x000D_
    Thus the comment by almost every law enforcement officer _x000D_
that we see around the State of Ohio, that 80, 90 percent of _x000D_
the crime in the county, every county, is due to this _x000D_
particular problem._x000D_
    The second thing that I think is different today is we have _x000D_
a culture problem. And, I think we can do something about that._x000D_
    When I was a county prosecuting attorney, you would, after _x000D_
a while, you would sort of get to know the drug dealers in your _x000D_
county. You would arrest them. And, some of them you got almost _x000D_
on speaking terms with._x000D_
    And, after we would arrest someone, I would ask them, what _x000D_
drugs are you selling? Or in some cases with the user, what _x000D_
drugs are you using? And, they would mention a number of _x000D_
different things._x000D_
    But, if I would ask, well, what about heroin? The answer _x000D_
would be, no, I am not crazy. I do not do that. That is other _x000D_
people. We do not do that. I do not put that needle in._x000D_
    There was some psychological barrier that was there. That _x000D_
psychological barrier for whatever reason is just down. It is _x000D_
gone. And, we have to culturally resurrect that._x000D_
    We cannot arrest our way out of this problem. What we do in _x000D_
law enforcement--we work with this every day. We have a special _x000D_
heroin unit that works with local law enforcement on the law _x000D_
enforcement side, the investigation side. But, we cannot arrest _x000D_
our way out of this problem._x000D_
    I want to compliment you, Senator Portman, for the CARA _x000D_
Act, and, you, Senator Brown, for your work in support of it._x000D_
    This takes a holistic approach. I think we have to have a _x000D_
holistic approach. We have to have education. We have to have _x000D_
prevention. We have to have treatment. And, we have to have the _x000D_
law enforcement side._x000D_
    Let me just mention a couple things. The bad news is the _x000D_
nature of this problem and how bad it is and how horrible it _x000D_
is._x000D_
    The good news is we are starting to see some maybe not _x000D_
progress in the numbers, but we are starting to see some _x000D_
communities that have figured out how to fight back._x000D_
    When we first started looking at the pain med problem, one _x000D_
of the things I noticed was that the communities that who were _x000D_
starting to make progress in this area--and I think this still _x000D_
is true as well for heroin--are communities that have come _x000D_
together, pulled together._x000D_
    It is usually led by a mom, sometimes a dad, but usually a _x000D_
mom of someone who has died, a boy, girl who has died. And, _x000D_
they sort of rise up in the local community._x000D_
    And, the ones that work involve the business community. _x000D_
They involve the faith based community, the churches. They _x000D_
involve law enforcement. They involve education. And, they have _x000D_
to come together._x000D_
    I was so impressed by this model, that a few years ago we _x000D_
put together a small group in our office. We now have six young _x000D_
ladies who work every single day to work with local communities _x000D_
to try and help them. Not to tell them what to do, not to _x000D_
tell--every community is different. But, rather to share what _x000D_
other communities have done._x000D_
    And so, I always mention that in any group. And, we have _x000D_
many times people who will take us up on it. Again, we do not _x000D_
pretend to be experts. But, what we do know is what is _x000D_
happening in other places in the State and what works._x000D_
    So, I would encourage us to look at this from the local _x000D_
point of view. Those of us at the Federal level and those of us _x000D_
at the State level, we can help._x000D_
    Ultimately, we are not going to solve this problem. We can _x000D_
help. We can help give people resources. We can help give them _x000D_
ideas. But, ultimately, it is going to have to be done at the _x000D_
individual community level, which is why I put this group _x000D_
together._x000D_
    Let me mention a couple other places. Sheriff John Tharp, _x000D_
the Sheriff in Lucas County, has a program that we have _x000D_
partnered with him. He came to me over a year ago and said, ``I _x000D_
have an idea.'' And, I thought he was going to talk about law _x000D_
enforcement. And, he said, ``No, that is not what I am taking _x000D_
about.''_x000D_
    He says that we have to get people into treatment more _x000D_
quickly. And, we have to, once they are in the treatment, make _x000D_
sure they stay in treatment._x000D_
    And so, what the sheriff has done with the help of local--_x000D_
some local money and some money that we gave him, he has a _x000D_
program that is over a year old now, and we begin to see some _x000D_
real results, where they will go out--if the emergency room is _x000D_
ready, when the emergency room has somebody who comes in and _x000D_
actually survives an overdose, the sheriff is called. The _x000D_
sheriff has a very small unit of dedicated people. They move. _x000D_
They come out._x000D_
    One individual will come and see the family and see the _x000D_
addict and see if maybe that is a teachable moment. See if that _x000D_
addict is ready at that point. And, if they do, that sheriff's _x000D_
deputy becomes really the advocate or the sponsor of that _x000D_
person._x000D_
    I talked to a few of the addicts who were recovering in _x000D_
this program a few weeks ago in Lucas County. One recovering _x000D_
addict pointed over across the room to the sheriff's deputy. He _x000D_
said, ``Do you see that sheriff's deputy over there? '' And, I _x000D_
said, ``Yes.'' He said, ``I call him five or six times a day.'' _x000D_
I said, ``Why do you call him five or six times a day? '' He _x000D_
said, ``I have to in order to get through the day. But, he has _x000D_
always been there for me.'' He said, ``Without him, I would not _x000D_
still be in recovery. I would have relapsed.''_x000D_
    So, there are programs out there. Senator Portman, down in _x000D_
your area, Colerain Township, they have a similar program that _x000D_
is going on. So, I think there is a lot of very good things _x000D_
that are going on._x000D_
    I do not think we can forget education. As a country, we _x000D_
have to do more in the area of prevention and in the area of _x000D_
education._x000D_
    I was on President Reagan's National Commission on Drug-_x000D_
Free Schools when I was in the U.S. House of Representatives in _x000D_
the 1980s. A little different in some ways and in some ways the _x000D_
same--a drug problem._x000D_
    The one that every expert who came in on education and drug _x000D_
prevention said to us is, you have to do something every single _x000D_
year. You have to start in kindergarten. You have to have _x000D_
something that is age appropriate. And, you have to go all the _x000D_
way through the 12th grade._x000D_
    And, if you think you are going to do something in the _x000D_
fifth grade and the ninth grade, and that is all you are going _x000D_
to do, I suppose that is better than nothing. But, it is not _x000D_
going to really get the job done._x000D_
    So, I think we have to kind of rethink how we are _x000D_
approaching this. We cannot put all the burden on the schools. _x000D_
But, we have to figure out some way, so that young people are _x000D_
getting the information they need in something that has been _x000D_
tested and we have data behind that it actually works as far as _x000D_
prevention._x000D_
    I was in Boardman a few weeks ago and talked to school _x000D_
officials. They have a program there they are just starting. _x000D_
They took a program basically off the shelf. They bought it, a _x000D_
proprietary program. They have inserted it into kindergarten _x000D_
all the way through 12th grade. And, they are just starting it. _x000D_
They actually put it into their science program. So, they work _x000D_
with their science teachers._x000D_
    So, it is a way maybe to get around the problem that we are _x000D_
always looking to schools to do everything. Well, let us figure _x000D_
out how to put that in. They do it through their science _x000D_
classes. It is basically nine periods a year, in kindergarten _x000D_
all the way through 12th grade._x000D_
    It will be a long time before we have the data. But, I _x000D_
think it looked very promising. And, I think that is something _x000D_
we need to look at in other communities._x000D_
    Again, thank you both very much for holding this hearing. _x000D_
It is very important._x000D_
    We have looked at the members of the panel, and we have _x000D_
looked at the people in the room. Mr. Chairman, as you said, we _x000D_
have a lot of great talent here._x000D_
    So, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about _x000D_
what I see, how I see this problem, at least from the Attorney _x000D_
General's view._x000D_
    Thank you."

    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Rendon appears in the Appendix on _x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Here, in Northeast Ohio, we have a really innovative _x000D_
program. It is the Northeast Ohio Heroin and Opioid Task Force. _x000D_
And, if you look out into this room, you will see many members _x000D_
of our task force from all different walks of life, all working _x000D_
together to help to solve this problem._x000D_
    The rise of heroin and fentanyl and the misuse of _x000D_
prescription opioids threatens our communities, our families, _x000D_
our safety. And, these things are all interrelated and they _x000D_
have to be addressed together. And, that is why the Department _x000D_
of Justice (DOJ) and the Administration are working closely _x000D_
with our Federal, our State, our local law enforcement officers _x000D_
to fight this growing epidemic through a combination of _x000D_
enforcement, prevention, education and treatment. It is truly a _x000D_
four legged stool, and without any one of those legs, the stool _x000D_
will not stand._x000D_
    And, this is truly a crisis in Northeast Ohio. We have _x000D_
heard a little bit of some of the statistics. But, let me fill _x000D_
you in on what we are seeing here in Cuyahoga County, and with _x000D_
thank you to our Medical Examiner, who I have to tell you was _x000D_
the first person to sound the alarm on this epidemic here in _x000D_
our county. So, heroin overdose deaths increased in Cuyahoga _x000D_
County by more than 400 percent between 2007 and 2012, when 161 _x000D_
people died of heroin overdoses. But, sadly, the number of _x000D_
heroin overdoses has increased year by year. And, recently, it _x000D_
has gotten dramatically worse with the introduction of _x000D_
fentanyl, which, as you mentioned, Chairman Portman, is _x000D_
incredibly potent and extremely deadly. So, according to the _x000D_
Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner, while there were only five _x000D_
overdose deaths in 2013 attributable to fentanyl, in 2014 that _x000D_
number rose to 37, and last year it was 91--91 overdose deaths _x000D_
attributable to fentanyl or a combination of heroin and _x000D_
fentanyl._x000D_
    And, last year 228 people, just in Cuyahoga County, died of _x000D_
an overdose of either heroin or fentanyl--or a combination of _x000D_
the two. And, this year we have already seen 125 fatal _x000D_
overdoses in Cuyahoga County, and it is only April. So, the _x000D_
devastation that this is wreaking throughout our community _x000D_
cannot be overstated._x000D_
    But, the crisis is not limited to Cuyahoga County. So, as _x000D_
you know, there are 40 counties in the Northern District of _x000D_
Ohio. And, we are seeing waves of overdose deaths everywhere in _x000D_
our district; Lorain, Summit, Stark, Lucas, Marion. It is _x000D_
everywhere throughout the Northern District of Ohio._x000D_
    And so, faced with this crisis, what we did is we assembled _x000D_
this task force. And, it brought together a wide diverse group _x000D_
of stakeholders to identify and implement comprehensive _x000D_
solutions to this growing crisis._x000D_
    And, in 2013, we held a summit to focus on the heroin _x000D_
epidemic. We had more than 700 people at that summit from all _x000D_
walks of life, from all aspects of our community; treatment _x000D_
providers, doctors, parents who had lost children, law _x000D_
enforcement, across the board._x000D_
    The result of that summit was the creation of a heroin and _x000D_
opioid community action plan. And, let me emphasize the word _x000D_
community action plan._x000D_
    This is the plan that guides the work of our task force. _x000D_
And, it addresses the heroin and opioid crisis from four _x000D_
different perspectives; law enforcement, health care policy, _x000D_
education and prevention and treatment._x000D_
    I want to take a minute just to highlight a few of the _x000D_
successes we have had, because the news is all so grim. But, _x000D_
there have been some successes, and they are worth noting._x000D_
    So, law enforcement. We created a heroin involved death _x000D_
investigation team. And, what this is, is a group of dedicated _x000D_
law enforcement officers who roll out to every overdose scene. _x000D_
And, they treat it like what it is, a crime scene, and they are _x000D_
there to gather evidence that we can then use in our criminal _x000D_
prosecutions._x000D_
    To date, the United States Attorney's office has brought _x000D_
nine death specification indictments, which carry a 20 year _x000D_
minimum mandatory term of incarceration for the dealers who are _x000D_
killing people in our community. And, there have been a dozen _x000D_
more manslaughter cases brought in the State court system, _x000D_
because we partner, of course, with the attorney general and _x000D_
all of our local county prosecutors._x000D_
    Health care policy. So, members of the task force, many of _x000D_
whom are sitting in this room, have worked to increase the _x000D_
physicians' use of the Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System _x000D_
(OARRS), which is the statewide prescription drug monitoring _x000D_
program. And, they have helped to develop really important _x000D_
increased training and education for doctors about the dangers _x000D_
and the unintended consequences of over prescribing opioids. _x000D_
And, I will note that a recent Centers for Disease Control _x000D_
(CDC) report showed that the total doses of opioids prescribed _x000D_
in Ohio decreased by 11.6 percent from 2012 to 2015, in no _x000D_
small measure as a result of the work of the members of our _x000D_
task force._x000D_
    Education and prevention. Members of the task force have _x000D_
organized town hall meetings and presentations at schools and _x000D_
with labor unions and community organizations throughout _x000D_
Cuyahoga County. And, through this, task force members have _x000D_
reached literally thousands of people. And, they have also _x000D_
spearheaded two significant media campaigns to raise very _x000D_
importantly awareness of this crisis._x000D_
    And then, finally, last but not least, I am looking at Dr. _x000D_
Jerry, treatment. So, the task force members have led the _x000D_
effort to expand the availability of the opioid overdose _x000D_
reversal drug naloxone to first responders and relatives of _x000D_
those who have substance use disorders. And, that work has _x000D_
literally saved hundreds of lives._x000D_
    And, they are continuing that work, while also addressing _x000D_
what you mentioned, which is the critical shortage of treatment _x000D_
facilities in our District and throughout the United States._x000D_
    These efforts, in my opinion, they are an incredible _x000D_
example of what we always talk about in the Department, a _x000D_
multi-faceted approach, that really is what we mean when we _x000D_
talk about being smart on crime. And, our task force, because _x000D_
of its success, is now a model that is being replicated at U.S. _x000D_
Attorney's offices all across the country._x000D_
    But, while we have had some successes, we are keenly aware _x000D_
that this problem just continues to grow and get worse by the _x000D_
day. And, it is morphed, as we have discussed, from painkillers _x000D_
to heroin to now an incredibly deadly new drug, fentanyl._x000D_
    And, as you have noted, Chairman Portman, we cannot arrest _x000D_
our way out of this problem. But, we have to aggressively _x000D_
prosecute the drug dealers who are bringing this poison into _x000D_
our community. And, we have to find a way to choke off the _x000D_
supplies of the drugs into our community._x000D_
    And, of course, simply getting treatment for everyone who _x000D_
has suffered through addiction, that is not going to solve the _x000D_
problem by itself either._x000D_
    But, given the number of people who we know are already _x000D_
addicted to opioids in our communities, we have to find a way _x000D_
to make treatment readily available to those who need it._x000D_
    And, of course, changing prescribing practices alone, that _x000D_
is not going to curb the problem either. But, we have to start _x000D_
impacting the way that doctors are prescribing opioids._x000D_
    And, we have to address the underlying incentives that _x000D_
cause that to happen in the first place._x000D_
    And, education is critical. And, that is why the _x000D_
Administration is now championing a practice that requires _x000D_
people who are seeking a DEA registration to get specifically _x000D_
trained on prescription opioids and the dangers and the need to _x000D_
carefully prescribe._x000D_
    And then, finally, every one of us has to continue to talk _x000D_
to our children, to our friends, to our colleagues about the _x000D_
dangers of opioids. Because no one is immune from this threat._x000D_
    As you mentioned, Chairman, Senator Brown, opioid addiction _x000D_
knows no boundaries. It is an equal opportunity killer of men _x000D_
and women, young and old, city, suburban, rural, wealthy and _x000D_
poor, white, black and Hispanic. It is everywhere. And, it is _x000D_
killing people in our community every day. We are all at risk._x000D_
    And, you mentioned, Senator Brown, Ebola and the Zika _x000D_
virus--sometimes I wonder if people were dropping dead at this _x000D_
rate of Ebola or Zika, how would we all be responding? And, _x000D_
would it look like the response that we are seeing to this _x000D_
crisis? And, if not, why not? How do we get to the stigma that _x000D_
underlies our failure to address this crisis with every single _x000D_
tool in our tool kit?_x000D_
    And so, from my perspective, this is going to take what we _x000D_
have all come to talk about as the ``all of the above'' _x000D_
approach. Everyone has to work together in concert. We have to _x000D_
roll up our sleeves to address what from my perspective, in my _x000D_
little corner of the world, is one of the worst public health _x000D_
crises I have ever seen and one that I hope never to see again._x000D_
    So, thank you."
2924629,2924628,2924630,19235,13,"    Thank you, Ms. Rendon. Director Plouck._x000D_
_x000D_
  TESTIMONY OF TRACY PLOUCK,\1\ DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF _x000D_
              MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES"
2924630,2924629,2924631,19235,13,"    I really appreciate the opportunity to present _x000D_
at this hearing today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Plouck appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 157._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    And, as you are aware, the opioid epidemic has hit all _x000D_
States. And, Governor John Kasich and his administration has _x000D_
worked tirelessly in the last 5 years with both State, local _x000D_
and Federal partners to curb the tide, and yet the storm just _x000D_
continues to rage._x000D_
    I know you both share the same concerns that the Governor _x000D_
does. And, I would like to talk to you a little bit today about _x000D_
Ohio's overall efforts and where we still have work ahead of _x000D_
us._x000D_
    Unintentional drug overdose deaths in Ohio reached an all _x000D_
time high of 2,482 in 2014, which is the most recent year _x000D_
available. That is 2,482 families that have been affected by a _x000D_
death related to overdose in our State just in one year. Opiate _x000D_
related deaths, which include both heroin and prescription _x000D_
painkillers, peaked at 1,988 deaths in 2014, up from only 296 _x000D_
in 2003. With 502 fentanyl-related drug overdose deaths in this _x000D_
State in 2014, fentanyl was a significant contributor to the _x000D_
rise in drug overdose deaths according to the preliminary data _x000D_
that has been released by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH). _x000D_
By comparison in 2013, just 84 deaths involved fentanyl. As a _x000D_
result, Ohio proactively requested assistance from the Center _x000D_
for Disease Control's EpiAid to better analyze our opiate _x000D_
related deaths. We are currently reviewing the recommendations _x000D_
and determining what should be implemented in Ohio to build on _x000D_
our effort. This continues to be a pressing issue for the _x000D_
State._x000D_
    Governor Kasich has made the fight against opiates a _x000D_
priority and is one of the nation's most outspoken advocates on _x000D_
the issue. Early in his administration, the Governor announced _x000D_
the establishment of the Governor's Cabinet Opiate Action Team _x000D_
(GCOAT) to fight opiate abuse in Ohio. GCOAT is comprised of _x000D_
directors from multiple cabinet agencies that touch the opiate _x000D_
issue. And, it is designed to foster collaboration across _x000D_
public health, treatment, law enforcement, education and other _x000D_
agencies that touch some facet of this complex challenge._x000D_
    I know you understand the importance of taking this issue _x000D_
in a multi-pronged way because of your work on CARA. Senator _x000D_
Portman, I would like to thank you for your sponsorship of the _x000D_
bill, and I would like to thank you, Senator Brown, for your _x000D_
support as well. CARA takes a similarly comprehensive approach _x000D_
and addresses on a national level several things that Ohio has _x000D_
demonstrated we know are working and making some progress._x000D_
    I would like to talk a little bit about some specific _x000D_
areas. And, I am going to start with prescribing practices and _x000D_
prescribing guidelines specifically._x000D_
    In its ongoing efforts to combat drug abuse and save lives, _x000D_
the Governor's Cabinet Opiate Action Team developed _x000D_
comprehensive prescribing guidelines for outpatient management _x000D_
of acute pain this past January. The acute guidelines follow _x000D_
previous prescribing guidelines for emergency departments, _x000D_
which were released in 2012, and the management of chronic pain _x000D_
in 2013. All three of these guidelines were developed in _x000D_
conjunction with clinical professional associations, health _x000D_
care providers, State licensing boards and State agencies. I _x000D_
know that CARA also addresses this issue from a national _x000D_
perspective. And, I applaud efforts to limit the number of _x000D_
opioids prescribed nationally to ensure that these powerful _x000D_
drugs are only used in the course of appropriate medical care._x000D_
    As a result of the prescribing guidelines and the increased _x000D_
utility of OARRS, our prescription drug monitoring system in _x000D_
Ohio, the number of prescriber and pharmacist queries using _x000D_
OARRS increased from 778,000 in 2010 to 9.3 million in 2014. _x000D_
And, Ohio is making further progress._x000D_
    The number of prescription opiates dispensed to Ohio _x000D_
patients in 2014 decreased by more than 40 million doses _x000D_
relative to the previous year._x000D_
    The number of individuals doctor shopping for controlled _x000D_
substances, including opiates, decreased from more than 3,100 _x000D_
in 2009 to approximately 960 in 2014._x000D_
    From 2013 to 2014, there was a nearly 11 percent decline in _x000D_
the number of patients prescribed opiates at a dose higher than _x000D_
the current guidelines that are recommended. Ohio patients _x000D_
receiving prescriptions for opiates and benzodiazepine _x000D_
sedatives at the same time dropped by 8 percent. So, we are _x000D_
seeing some progress related to these interventions._x000D_
    I want to say a little bit about prevention, which has been _x000D_
mentioned by both of the other panelists. In 2014, the Governor _x000D_
and the first lady launched ``Start Talking,'' which is a _x000D_
statewide youth drug prevention initiative based on the premise _x000D_
that youth are up to 50 percent less likely to initiate drug _x000D_
use if an adult who cares about them talks directly with them _x000D_
about this issue and the risks involved. Understanding that _x000D_
this is not an easy discussion to begin, the program aims to _x000D_
help parents and other adults communicate better with kids on _x000D_
these topics. ``Start Talking'' offers three free tools for _x000D_
parents and other youth leaders to approach children and young _x000D_
adults._x000D_
    Nearly 57,000 adults are receiving these biweekly messages _x000D_
via e-mail to help start important conversations._x000D_
    ``Parents360Rx'' is the second component of the program. It _x000D_
is a national program that Partnership for Drug-Free Kids _x000D_
established that is designed to help educate adults about the _x000D_
dangers found in their own medicine cabinets. This is a good _x000D_
topical source for community meetings to help draw attention to _x000D_
some precautions that every household can take in the fight _x000D_
against the opiate epidemic._x000D_
    And then, finally, ``5 Minutes for Life'' is a program that _x000D_
is led by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the National Guard and _x000D_
local law enforcement in partnership with high schools. _x000D_
Troopers, law enforcement officers and National Guard members _x000D_
talk directly with students, usually student athletes, to _x000D_
encourage them to become ambassadors and lead peer-to-peer _x000D_
conversations about the importance of healthy choices. During _x000D_
this school year alone, over 260 events have been hosted with _x000D_
more than 35,000 students participating._x000D_
    I want to say just a moment about criminal justice _x000D_
initiatives and our support for court involved individuals._x000D_
    Established in 2014, we launched the addiction treatment _x000D_
program. This supports drug courts in establishing a program to _x000D_
provide addiction treatment, including medication assisted _x000D_
treatment, to non-violent adult offenders with dependence on _x000D_
opiates, alcohol or both. The first phase of the program _x000D_
reached 410 men and women, two-thirds of whom also had a co-_x000D_
occurring mental health disorder. According to a Case Western _x000D_
Reserve University evaluation of the program, past months drug _x000D_
use among program participants decreased by almost 70 percent, _x000D_
while crimes committed dipped 86 percent. At the same time, _x000D_
employment increased by 114 percent, while stable housing _x000D_
increased by nearly 29 percent. Among participants, 60 percent _x000D_
had a job, and 91 percent had stable housing upon completion of _x000D_
the program. This program is funded with $11 million over the _x000D_
current biennium in 14 Ohio counties. CARA emphasizes the _x000D_
importance of treatment as an alternative to incarceration, and _x000D_
we are seeing that work here in Ohio is effective in that _x000D_
regard with the drug court model._x000D_
    I want to say just a little bit about expanding the _x000D_
availability and the use of naloxone or Narcan, as has been _x000D_
noted earlier._x000D_
    Our department administers grants for first responders _x000D_
across the State. We know that through State emergency medical _x000D_
services (EMS) data, naloxone was administered to 18,438 _x000D_
patients in 2015. That is more than 18,000 deaths avoided as a _x000D_
result of this lifesaving measure. Without this important _x000D_
overdose antidote, Ohio's already two large number of overdose _x000D_
deaths would be much higher. The most recent State budget _x000D_
included $1 million to purchase naloxone for first responders, _x000D_
including police and fire. A concerted effort has been made to _x000D_
convince local agencies of the importance of carrying naloxone, _x000D_
oftentimes as an overdose victim cannot wait for EMS to arrive. _x000D_
And, we have seen many communities sign on to this. CARA also _x000D_
addresses this issue, and we support your efforts. Naloxone use _x000D_
is critical to saving lives and getting people into treatment._x000D_
    I would like to say a little bit about Neonatal Abstinence _x000D_
Syndrome. In 2013, the Kasich administration launched an effort _x000D_
to address the epidemic among the smallest of Ohioans, babies _x000D_
born to mothers who are addicted to prescription painkillers, _x000D_
opiates and heroin. By engaging expecting mothers in a _x000D_
combination of counseling, medication assisted treatment and _x000D_
case management, the 3-year project is estimated to reduce _x000D_
infant hospital stays by 30 percent among those enrolled moms _x000D_
and babies. One of the goals of CARA is to improve addiction _x000D_
and treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women. And, _x000D_
we believe Ohio is developing a model that can be replicated _x000D_
nationally._x000D_
    Across the State, I continue to hear stories of waiting _x000D_
lists and difficulty accessing treatment, in part due to the _x000D_
Federal Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion. _x000D_
Treatment works, but it is not easy. I recently read of a _x000D_
couple who, after multiple relapses, found themselves homeless, _x000D_
involved in criminal justice and lost custody of their young _x000D_
daughter. Through treatment received through extended Medicaid _x000D_
benefits, they have over a year of sobriety. They have regained _x000D_
custody of their daughter, and they are now employed. We know _x000D_
that approximately 400,000 additional Ohioans were able to _x000D_
connect with mental health and/or drug addiction treatment as a _x000D_
result of the Medicaid expansion when it was extended to adults _x000D_
up to 138 percent of poverty. Capacity and workforce continue _x000D_
to be a challenge. And, the IMD exclusion poses a barrier to _x000D_
treatment access. I appreciate that CARA sets up a way to take _x000D_
a serious look at the IMD exclusion and its impact on _x000D_
treatment._x000D_
    Thank you again for inviting me to testify on this very _x000D_
important topic today. I want to commend both of you on your _x000D_
work on this issue. And, I especially commend you, Senator _x000D_
Portman, on your leadership on this issue through your career. _x000D_
Again, as I described in my testimony and at length in my _x000D_
written statement for the record, a number of the provisions in _x000D_
the CARA bill are activities that Ohio is undertaking. And, we _x000D_
fully support the expansion on a more national scale of these _x000D_
efforts._x000D_
    I stand ready to work with you as we move forward. And, we _x000D_
look forward to any questions that you might have."
2924631,2924630,2924632,19235,13,"    Great. Thank you, Director Plouck. I _x000D_
appreciate it. And, we will have some questions. I am going to _x000D_
ask Senator Brown to go first._x000D_
    I want to just make one comment that is pretty obvious to _x000D_
everybody in the room. If we can get CARA passed, because of _x000D_
the programs that all three of these panelists talked about, we _x000D_
will be in a good position to access some of these grants, _x000D_
whether it is with regard to prevention, education or _x000D_
treatment, medication assisted treatment or, as you mentioned, _x000D_
the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, working with pregnant women. _x000D_
Our veterans, of course, in Ohio are great. And, they are _x000D_
funded in here._x000D_
    So, there is the diversion programs, drug courts. So, there _x000D_
is a lot of opportunity here for Ohio. We play a leading role _x000D_
thanks for the additional help that will come from CARA going _x000D_
forward._x000D_
    I will ask Senator Brown to go first with questions--and I _x000D_
want to ask you some myself."
2924632,2924631,2924633,19235,13,    Yes. No objection.
2924633,2924632,2924634,19235,13,"    Chairman Portman and Senator Brown, I am not _x000D_
the lead cabinet director on this issue. And, I would want to _x000D_
defer to any clarification that Director McCarthy from Ohio _x000D_
Medicaid would want to bring to this._x000D_
    I think the general philosophy behind ``Healthy Ohio,'' _x000D_
when it was added into the last biannual budget, was a _x000D_
philosophy of personal responsibility for individuals. And, _x000D_
Medicaid is following the law to request the waiver that was _x000D_
stipulated in the budget bill._x000D_
    As far as access to addiction and mental health services, _x000D_
those are named services in the Ohio Medicaid benefit. And if, _x000D_
those would be subject to the same requirements related to call _x000D_
sharing or anything that would be required as a part of _x000D_
``Healthy Ohio'' waiver._x000D_
    So, I do not believe that addiction treatment is approached _x000D_
any differently than other Medicaid services in that regard."
2924634,2924633,2924635,19235,13,"    The Ohio Department of Medicaid is following _x000D_
the law that was enacted in the budget bill to request the _x000D_
waiver from the Federal Government."
2924635,2924634,2924636,19235,13,"    As an advocate for individuals and families _x000D_
that are struggling with mental health and addiction challenges _x000D_
in their lives, I think that we should work to try to overcome _x000D_
any barrier to access to treatment that exists."
2924636,2924635,2924637,19235,13,"    I recognize that to an individual, the waiver, _x000D_
if enacted as it has been proposed pursuant to the budget bill, _x000D_
does create some obstacles that would need to be overcome on an _x000D_
individual basis depending on the resources of the individual."
2924637,2924636,2924638,19235,13,"    Chairman and Senator Brown, I think that is an _x000D_
excellent question._x000D_
    Because I truly believe that the success that we have _x000D_
achieved so far and that we can achieve in the future is going _x000D_
to be very much depending on what occurs at the local level._x000D_
    We all have a role. We do what we do. U.S. Attorney does _x000D_
what they do in regard to law enforcement. We try to help with _x000D_
the six individuals who I told you about who will go out and _x000D_
help in the local community._x000D_
    The communities that have started to change the culture, to _x000D_
change how we look at it, communities that have begun to really _x000D_
assist people with not only getting in treatment, but what _x000D_
happens when we get out of treatment, those communities--where _x000D_
we have seen that happen is because the local community got _x000D_
together._x000D_
    I know you had a lot of town hall meetings. Senator Portman _x000D_
has had town hall meetings. I suspect you found what I found _x000D_
when I did this._x000D_
    We did a number of town hall meetings over a year ago. And, _x000D_
to me the interesting thing, but also kind of scary thing was, _x000D_
that we would have a lot of people, a lot of just citizens who _x000D_
came. And, we would have a panel of experts. But, we would have _x000D_
a roomful of citizens. And, we encouraged just a conversation._x000D_
    And, what I found was that you would get someone who would _x000D_
stand up on one end of the room and say, well, in this _x000D_
community we need such and such. We do not have that. Somebody _x000D_
else on the other side of the room stands up and says, yes, we _x000D_
do._x000D_
    So, a lot of it is I think pulling people together and _x000D_
getting people out of their normal area where they work and _x000D_
communities coming together._x000D_
    And, when you have a grass roots effort in the local _x000D_
community, what happens is, people in that community start _x000D_
talking to each other more. That is how we are going to do _x000D_
this._x000D_
    I think the other thing average citizens can do is to say, _x000D_
hey, look, in this community, somehow we have to have education _x000D_
at every grade level. And, we have to work with our schools, _x000D_
who we ask to do all kinds of a million things. And, they are _x000D_
overburdened. But, we have to work with our schools. And, the _x000D_
community has to say to the school, this is very important._x000D_
    If we are going to deal with this problem in the future, if _x000D_
we are going to have some success 5 years, 10 years, or 20 _x000D_
years from now, we have to start in kindergarten. And, we have _x000D_
to work all the way through._x000D_
    So, I am a great believer in the local community and where _x000D_
the local community comes together, where the business _x000D_
community is involved, where the church faith based community _x000D_
is involved. I think we can see some progress. That is what the _x000D_
individual can do."
2924638,2924637,2924639,19235,13,"    Senator Brown, I think that is an excellent _x000D_
question. Because I think there are things that every single _x000D_
person in our community can do to help with this crisis._x000D_
    And so, what you are doing here today is a huge step, _x000D_
because we all need to be educated about what is happening. And _x000D_
so, the more we get the word out, the more people know that _x000D_
this is out there, the more they can figure out where their _x000D_
piece is, where they can help._x000D_
    But, for the average citizen, what I tell people when I am _x000D_
at these town hall meetings, there is a ton that everyone can _x000D_
do._x000D_
    So, you can start by going home and opening your medicine _x000D_
cabinet and figuring out what is in there that should not be _x000D_
there that you were prescribed a year and-a-half ago._x000D_
    And then, on April 30, you can see my good friends at the _x000D_
DEA on their drug take-back day, and take that medication _x000D_
safely to a drug drop box and get rid of it before somebody _x000D_
accidentally tries it, some young kid who thinks it is safe _x000D_
because it is in a medicine bottle, somebody who happens to be _x000D_
in your home._x000D_
    You can do that on a daily basis in many of our police _x000D_
stations. And, I know some of our pharmacies are now starting _x000D_
to agree to have drug drop boxes in the pharmacy, which I think _x000D_
is phenomenal. So, that is something you can do._x000D_
    You can talk to your kids, to your family, to your friends. _x000D_
My oldest son is here. And, he can tell you, I think maybe _x000D_
because of my career, I have been talking to my children about _x000D_
the dangers of drugs since they were toddlers._x000D_
    So, just as we have taught all of our children to buckle _x000D_
their seat belt and not smoke cigarettes and not drink and _x000D_
drive, we have to have on that list, do not use drugs. You do _x000D_
not know, that first time that you take it, you have no idea _x000D_
how it is going to impact you. And, then we all have to look at _x000D_
ourselves in the mirror and figure out when we became a culture _x000D_
that has to be pain free at all times. Right?_x000D_
    So, when I had my wisdom teeth out, I got Tylenol, and I _x000D_
think I got to stay home from school for a day. Now, you take _x000D_
your children to get their wisdom teeth out, and they want to _x000D_
give you Percocet. Percocet. We as parents, we as citizens, _x000D_
need to stand up and say, no. I am not taking that _x000D_
prescription. I do not need that prescription._x000D_
    My husband had his elbow operated on--not removed. We do _x000D_
not need a 60 day supply of Vicodin. I want three. Right?_x000D_
    But, I found out you can do the same thing at the pharmacy. _x000D_
So, if they do give you the prescription for 30 Vicodin, you do _x000D_
not have to take 30 Vicodin. You can talk to your pharmacist _x000D_
and say, how many of these do I actually reasonably need to _x000D_
address this problem? And, they will tell you, two, three. And, _x000D_
you can walk home from the pharmacy with just what you need._x000D_
    So, it has to start with each one of us in our homes with _x000D_
the things that we care about, with our commitment to this next _x000D_
generation and the future of our community. And so, there is a _x000D_
role for every single person in our community to help with _x000D_
this. And, getting the word out is the first step._x000D_
    So, thank you."
2924639,2924638,2924640,19235,13,"    Thank you. Thank you, Senator Brown._x000D_
    I could not agree you with more. And, tragically, we are _x000D_
going to hear from a witness in a little while about wisdom _x000D_
teeth extraction and the specific issue that you raised and how _x000D_
that led to an addiction and eventual overdose and death._x000D_
    But, and you are right, everybody has a role. One of the _x000D_
things we tried to do in this legislation, drop boxes, for _x000D_
instance, we do provide for them to be at pharmacies and at _x000D_
long term care facilities and in hospitals that have _x000D_
pharmacies._x000D_
    I must tell you, I have a frustration on the prevention and _x000D_
education side, because, 22 years ago, I started this group in _x000D_
Cincinnati. Officially, we were having our 20th year _x000D_
anniversary I think in a couple weeks. I founded it. I chaired _x000D_
it for the first 9 years. I was on the board until I joined the _x000D_
Senate._x000D_
    It is called Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. _x000D_
Now, it is called Prevention First. And, we are considered a _x000D_
model coalition. I was the author of the Drug Fee Communities _x000D_
Act of 1997. We have spawned 2,000 coalitions throughout the _x000D_
country._x000D_
    As all three of you have acknowledged, we are still not _x000D_
able to persuade so many of our fellow citizens, not just kids, _x000D_
this is not just about young people, of the dangers. And, the _x000D_
best research shows that it is this recognition of the danger _x000D_
that kept those people from trying heroin. In the 1990s when we _x000D_
started our coalition, it was not an issue. Now, we have 13 _x000D_
year old kids in Ohio trying heroin, first time, shooting up._x000D_
    Parents, all the evidence shows parents or other _x000D_
caregivers, when there is not two parents at home--which _x000D_
unfortunately is the case in many of our communities. And, in _x000D_
many situations you do not have a parent who is available, even _x000D_
if the parent is in the family. But, parents make a huge _x000D_
difference._x000D_
    The single largest difference as a parent, when I had three _x000D_
teenagers, well, all three are passed teenagers now barely, you _x000D_
kind of wonder sometimes. But, it is incredibly important, as _x000D_
you say._x000D_
    But, on the issue of community coalitions and this whole _x000D_
issue of prevention and education, we are going to hear from _x000D_
Rob Brandt later, who has become an expert on this by _x000D_
necessity._x000D_
    But, what should we be doing differently? The CARA program _x000D_
starts a national awareness campaign, specifically on this _x000D_
issue of the connection between prescription drugs and opioid _x000D_
addiction, and the fentanyl and the heroin connection._x000D_
    Because four out of five people who are addicted to heroin _x000D_
start on prescription drugs. That is what they say. And, we _x000D_
need to--people do not know that. So, they do not know when _x000D_
they go to have a relatively small procedure that they should _x000D_
not be asking for the Percocet. Instead they should be asking _x000D_
for the Toradol or the Tylenol. So, that specifically is in _x000D_
here._x000D_
    But, what would you say? And, Attorney General DeWine, _x000D_
again you have been active on this, Ms. Rendon and Director _x000D_
Plouck, if you would like to jump in. But, what would you do _x000D_
differently in terms of the prevention and the education side _x000D_
of this, something different and new?"
2924640,2924639,2924641,19235,13,    No. You go ahead.
2924641,2924640,2924642,19235,13,"    Well, so one of the things that I think is an _x000D_
example that is really incredible to me from our task force _x000D_
here in Northeast Ohio is the partnership between law _x000D_
enforcement, treatment, education and regular community _x000D_
members, which has allowed us in some respects to get a little _x000D_
bit ahead of the curve._x000D_
    So, I talked earlier about our Medical Examiner (ME) _x000D_
sounding the alarm on this problem as it came on the horizon. _x000D_
So, they were the first to see fentanyl in pill form in our _x000D_
district. They sent out an alert, and it came to us, because we _x000D_
are on this task force._x000D_
    And so, it went immediately to the DEA. And, within weeks, _x000D_
the DEA had made a massive seizure of fentanyl in pill form, _x000D_
just shy of 1,000 pills. And, we were able to charge that _x000D_
individual in Federal court within days and address this _x000D_
problem and get the word out very publicly._x000D_
    And, what was so important about that is the fentanyl pills _x000D_
were shaped and dyed to look like oxycodone. And so, if you are _x000D_
an oxycodone user, and that is what you think you are taking, _x000D_
and it is fentanyl, it is an overdose waiting to happen. I _x000D_
mean, every one of those pills was an overdose waiting to _x000D_
happen._x000D_
    But, we were able, because of this group that we have _x000D_
together and the constant communication that we have, both when _x000D_
we are sitting together in our office and then also on a _x000D_
regular basis by e-mail and phone, we were able to sound a _x000D_
really loud alarm bell and get the word out to the drug using _x000D_
population._x000D_
    Joan Synenberg was here earlier. She is a common pleas _x000D_
court judge. She has one of the drug courts. There she is, back _x000D_
there. She is a member of our task force. And, told us a really _x000D_
heart-breaking story of one of her graduates--I was at the _x000D_
graduation--who 2 days after graduation overdosed and died._x000D_
    And so, that caused us to realize that we have to get to _x000D_
her graduates as they are walking out the door to make sure _x000D_
that they understand how dangerous the world has become while _x000D_
they have been sober._x000D_
    Because the heroin users do not know how deadly and _x000D_
dangerous the fentanyl is. And, when you are taking an illegal _x000D_
drug, unlike a drug that you get at the pharmacy, you have no _x000D_
idea what it is you are about to put in your mouth._x000D_
    And so, unless you can get the word out, really actively, _x000D_
really publicly through the media, through one on one meetings, _x000D_
through this combination of people working at all levels, you _x000D_
cannot impact the problem._x000D_
    But, all of us together, that is why the stool has to have _x000D_
the four legs, all of us together, we can make a difference. _x000D_
And, we are. It is disheartening when it is not going in the _x000D_
direction that you want it to. But, I am telling you every day _x000D_
we are saving lives and will continue to do so."
2924642,2924641,2924643,19235,13,"    I have a couple of comments. Mr. Chairman, you _x000D_
are absolutely right. There is a natural progression from _x000D_
opiates to heroin._x000D_
    One of the things that we partnered with Governor John _x000D_
Kasich's office, right after he took office and I took office, _x000D_
was to really crack down on doctors who are really nothing more _x000D_
than drug dealers._x000D_
    We have taken, and I say we, because we are the lawyers for _x000D_
the State Medical Board, and we pushed this. But, the State _x000D_
Medical Board has really stepped up. For many years they were _x000D_
not frankly doing what they needed to do._x000D_
    They have taken I believe 70 doctors' licenses in the State _x000D_
of Ohio. I was involved in some of the raids. And, I will not _x000D_
take your time to tell you the horror stories. But, we had one _x000D_
doctor who was on the circuit, basically. He would spend one _x000D_
day--and he had 10 offices around the State._x000D_
    And so, that--if we can stop people from--change the _x000D_
culture regarding an opiate, we are going to see some progress _x000D_
in the heroin as well. Because one flows, one flows from the _x000D_
other._x000D_
    We had a real pendulum swing, in regard to the culture of _x000D_
prescribing pain meds. And, if you recall, 15 years ago or so, _x000D_
the concern was that doctors were not treating pain. And, that _x000D_
was probably a correct comment, that we needed to do a better _x000D_
job, particularly people who have long term retractable pain. _x000D_
But, we went too far the other way. We are now starting to move _x000D_
back._x000D_
    But, I will tell you, I had the same experience as I have _x000D_
experienced with a granddaughter who had her wisdom teeth taken _x000D_
out and was given dozens and dozens of pills. That was what the _x000D_
prescription was. Our daughter, we told her not to take any of _x000D_
them. She did not take any of them._x000D_
    So, we are not there with changing the culture with the _x000D_
medical community. We have come a long way._x000D_
    As to the second thing, I will go back to what I said, Mr. _x000D_
Chairman and Senator Brown, we have not done a very good job in _x000D_
this country in regard to education. I think you have to be--we _x000D_
have to be careful, is what some of the experts will--I do not _x000D_
intend to be an expert. But, will tell me is, there is some _x000D_
things we do--we could be doing that we might think is the _x000D_
right way in education, and it may be exacerbating the problem. _x000D_
So, I think whatever we do, it would have to be evidence based. _x000D_
And, we have to have that tested._x000D_
    But, you all will remember when I was about leaving, and _x000D_
when Senator Brown was about coming, I think, in the Senate, _x000D_
you were in the House, but, killed the national funding. It was _x000D_
not very much in education. But, every school got some of it. _x000D_
Every school got something. And, that just went away. I lost _x000D_
that fight. And, those who were fighting on our side also lost. _x000D_
We lost that._x000D_
    So, I think we have to look at that more and see what the _x000D_
Federal Government can do. I think candidly we have to do _x000D_
something in this State, so that we are doing something with _x000D_
education K through 12 every year. Nothing less than that is _x000D_
acceptable. Nothing less than that is going to begin at least _x000D_
to deal with this problem._x000D_
    We are not doing that. And, I am not blaming anyone. But, _x000D_
we have to start doing that again."
2924643,2924642,2924644,19235,13,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I have so many other questions. And, I am going to continue _x000D_
the discussion with all three of you and then with Senator _x000D_
Brown on these issues._x000D_
    But, we do have another panel that is patiently waiting. _x000D_
And, I want to get them up here, too._x000D_
    Thank you to all three of you for not just coming today and _x000D_
sharing your views with this distinguished group of people who _x000D_
are in the trenches, but for what you do every single day to _x000D_
help to save lives and to pull lives back together. So, we look _x000D_
forward to continue to work with you. And, thank you for your _x000D_
testimony."
2924644,2924643,2924645,19235,13,    Thank you.
2924645,2924644,2924646,19235,13,"    I would now like to call the next panel _x000D_
up, if we could, please. Dr. Michele Walsh, Dr. Kotz, Emily _x000D_
Metz and Rob Brandt._x000D_
    OK. We are on to the next panelists here. I would like to _x000D_
get started. Why do we not start by swearing in the panel, _x000D_
since this is the custom of this Committee to do this. So, _x000D_
please stand and raise your right hand._x000D_
    Do you swear the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?_x000D_
    Thank you. Let the record show that all the answers were in _x000D_
the affirmative._x000D_
    We appreciate each of you coming today and look forward to _x000D_
the opportunity to hear from you and also to get some questions _x000D_
in._x000D_
    I was probably negligent in not mentioning for the last _x000D_
panel that we are asking for five minute opening statements. _x000D_
And, I know you all know that. But, try to stick to 5 minutes, _x000D_
if you can, because that will give us more time to have _x000D_
interaction between yourselves and we will be able to ask you _x000D_
direct questions._x000D_
    Again, we have an amazing group here. First, is Dr. _x000D_
Michelle Walsh, who is right here. I mentioned earlier the _x000D_
Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital work. It is incredible. _x000D_
She has given the opportunity to tour it a couple times, I _x000D_
think, maybe a few times, but more recently with regard to this _x000D_
issue of babies who are born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. _x000D_
So, thank you for being here._x000D_
    Dr. Michele Walsh is division chief of neonatology right _x000D_
here at UH. She will talk about that issue. After Dr. Walsh, we _x000D_
will hear from Dr. Nancy Young. Dr. Young is an expert in the _x000D_
issue of substance abuse and its impact on children. She is _x000D_
going to expand on the broader impact of the Neonatal _x000D_
Abstinence Syndrome we mentioned earlier._x000D_
    In particular, Dr. Young is going to discuss the _x000D_
correlation of substance abuse and children entering the child _x000D_
welfare system. Again these are areas that she has testified _x000D_
about before. In fact, she came to our Finance Committee, where _x000D_
Senator Brown both and I serve, and testified before the U.S. _x000D_
Senate. I appreciate her willingness to come here to Cleveland._x000D_
    Dr. Margaret Kotz is here. Dr. Kotz is an addiction expert. _x000D_
She is a specialist right here at University Hospital. And, she _x000D_
told me this in our round table discussion last year. We got to _x000D_
talk to her about some of her work._x000D_
    And, she is going to discuss the merits of medication _x000D_
assisted treatment. That is one we did not get a chance to get _x000D_
into as deeply as I wanted to in the first panel. We look _x000D_
forward to that._x000D_
    Emily Metz is here from project DAWN. She is going to speak _x000D_
about the work in the community to get naloxone out to prevent _x000D_
these overdoses. We talked a lot about that today._x000D_
    I think I am going to be with you later this afternoon and _x000D_
be able to see some of your good work directly at the free _x000D_
clinic. And, also I know you work with MetroHealth, their _x000D_
facility here in Cleveland. So, we look forward to hearing from _x000D_
you._x000D_
    And then, last but not least, Rob Brandt is here with us. _x000D_
And, I was looking at Rob when there was discussion about this _x000D_
issue of prescribing to our kids prescription drugs that are _x000D_
addictive, in the case of a wisdom tooth extraction._x000D_
    And, unfortunately, Rob is an expert. He is a business _x000D_
leader. He got involved with prevention because of his family--_x000D_
his son, Robby. He has a group called Robby's Voice. They are _x000D_
awesome, because they are out there in the schools. We talked _x000D_
about doing it at young ages. He is there in the elementary _x000D_
schools. And, he works to bring the message of drug education _x000D_
and drug prevention to students and families._x000D_
    So, again, thank you all for being here._x000D_

2924646,2924645,2924647,19235,13,"    Thank you, Chairman Portman, Senator Brown and _x000D_
distinguished guests. I am Michelle Walsh. I am the Chief of _x000D_
Neonatology here at Rainbow. I thank the Committee for holding _x000D_
this field hearing in Cleveland. And, we are proud to host you _x000D_
at the UH Case Medical Center. I thank the Committee for _x000D_
holding this field hearing in Cleveland. And, we are proud to _x000D_
host you at the UH Case Medical Center. I have been privileged _x000D_
to care for the tiny babies of Northeastern Ohio for over 25 _x000D_
years. And, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on their _x000D_
behalf._x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Never have I seen a public health epidemic of the severity _x000D_
of the current opioid epidemic among our citizens. And, as _x000D_
others have said, Ohio unfortunately has the unfortunate _x000D_
distinction of being among the lead in the entire country. We _x000D_
must focus our efforts on a cohesive national strategy that _x000D_
attacks every facet of this complicated problem. In the same _x000D_
way, as Senator Brown alluded, that we came together as a _x000D_
nation to combat Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and _x000D_
more recently Ebola, the same urgent epidemiologic methods and _x000D_
prevention are needed to combat this scourge. The Comprehensive _x000D_
Addiction and Recovery Act championed by you, Senator Portman, _x000D_
and so many others is exactly the right direction to address _x000D_
the complexities of addiction treatment, the inadequate numbers _x000D_
of programs, inadequate numbers of trained physicians and _x000D_
addiction specialists and the critical shortage of facilities _x000D_
to address this exploding issue._x000D_
    As others have highlighted before me, and I will not _x000D_
repeat, the epidemic is staggering. And, I entered into the _x000D_
record data on the explosive growth from 2001 to 2011 of the _x000D_
number of citizens in Ohio. Which the data from the Ohio multi-_x000D_
agency community report documented that in 2001, there were _x000D_
only eight counties that had a significant problem with opioid _x000D_
addiction. But, by the last available report in 2011, there _x000D_
were only eight counties----"
2924647,2924646,2924648,19235,13,"    That will be entered into the record._x000D_
of addiction._x000D_
    The fentanyl problem is exploding. And, unfortunately, the _x000D_
epidemic among adults has led to a corresponding epidemic among _x000D_
newborns. A recent publication from Tennessee analyzing _x000D_
Medicaid data indicated that 27 percent of pregnant women were _x000D_
prescribed one or more opiates during their pregnancy._x000D_
    So, it does have to start with education, not just of our _x000D_
children, but also more education of physicians. And, as has _x000D_
been highlighted here, it is not just physicians. It is _x000D_
dentists. It is emergency room physicians who in the interest _x000D_
of being compassionate are over prescribing these drugs._x000D_
    The tragic occurrence of a newborn addicted to narcotics _x000D_
causes a syndrome similar to what is seen in adults--_x000D_
jitteriness, fever, diarrhea, poor feeding, and, if not _x000D_
treated, seizures._x000D_
    About half of the babies that are narcotic exposed in the _x000D_
womb require pharmacologic treatment. The problem is that the _x000D_
strategies were largely unstudied. And so, there is huge _x000D_
variation in the amount of drugs used and the duration of the _x000D_
treatment._x000D_
    Governor Kasich challenged Ohio children's hospitals to _x000D_
work together to come up with a better approach to this. And, _x000D_
we were able to publish our research that showed a significant _x000D_
improvement in the treatment of the newborns. Working together, _x000D_
we identified best practices for caring for the family and the _x000D_
infant and improving the integration of care between _x000D_
obstetricians, neonatologists and addiction medicine _x000D_
specialists._x000D_
    From the earliest days of our work in 2011 to today, we _x000D_
have decreased the number of opiate-exposed newborns who _x000D_
received opiate treatment from 60 percent to 45 percent--and _x000D_
decreased the length of their treatment from 25 days to 16 days _x000D_
and the total hospitalization from 31 days to 19 days._x000D_
    As we took that, we moved from the six children's _x000D_
hospitals, and with funding from the Ohio Department of _x000D_
Medicaid, we moved this into our statewide Ohio Perinatal _x000D_
Quality Collaborative (OPQC). And, I am privileged to lead that _x000D_
group. And, we are now active in all 105 maternity hospitals in _x000D_
Ohio. And, in fact, on Monday, we will have our third learning _x000D_
session where over 500 health professionals will meet together _x000D_
to share lessons learned and further improve our treatment _x000D_
course._x000D_
    While embracing the cohesive approach that you have heard _x000D_
from the first panel, we are just beginning to see the tide _x000D_
turn on the amount of narcotics prescribed in Ohio. And, for _x000D_
the first time, the data comparing 2012 to 2014, the amount of _x000D_
opiates prescribed decreased for the first time. And, we hope _x000D_
that this will be a harbinger that as prescribed opiates _x000D_
decrease, the epidemic of addiction will decrease as well._x000D_
    I believe Ohio's approach to be a model for the Nation. _x000D_
And, I respectfully urge additional approaches like the CARA _x000D_
Act to continue efforts to educate physicians and dentists and _x000D_
all other prescribers on appropriate pain treatment, especially _x000D_
the limited role of narcotics in acute pain and the science of _x000D_
addiction._x000D_
    All of the efforts limiting illegal prescribing practices _x000D_
and requiring the mandatory use of our OARRS prescription _x000D_
platform is beginning to make inroads._x000D_
    We do need to create new programs within our opioid _x000D_
maintenance clinics, encouraging mothers to focus on their _x000D_
recovery and consider delaying pregnancy until the mother's _x000D_
health and dependence are improved._x000D_
    We also, as has been emphasized, need to enhance programs _x000D_
that encourage women to seek prenatal care and avoid _x000D_
criminalizing pregnant women with narcotic addiction. Some _x000D_
States have criminalized using opiates during pregnancy. And, _x000D_
what we are seeing, as some of those States are adjacent to us, _x000D_
we are seeing increasing numbers of those women seeking care in _x000D_
Ohio, rather than seeking care in their home State._x000D_
    We need to create incentives for new methadone treatment _x000D_
providers to enter into the field and eliminate barriers to _x000D_
prescribing Suboxone replacement therapy during pregnancy, _x000D_
which will decrease the severity of newborn withdrawal and _x000D_
allow certified providers to increase the number of patients _x000D_
they are treating._x000D_
    Lastly, we need additional residential treatment programs _x000D_
that welcome both the mother and her infant and can _x000D_
comprehensively support the recovery._x000D_
    Pregnancy is a teachable moment, where women are highly _x000D_
motivated to change and improve their lives and the lives of _x000D_
their children. And, among all of those who are treated for _x000D_
addiction, the success rates are higher in pregnancy than they _x000D_
are in other populations._x000D_
    And finally, as was alluded by Senator Brown, we need to _x000D_
fund research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as we _x000D_
do not know what the long term consequences to these infants _x000D_
are going to be, and whether there are going to be impacts on _x000D_
their intellectual development in the future or in their _x000D_
vulnerability to addiction themselves in the future._x000D_
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. And, I _x000D_
stand ready to support your efforts in any way possible. Thank _x000D_
you."
2924648,2924647,2924649,19235,13,"    Thank you, Dr. Walsh, you already have. _x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF NANCY K. YOUNG, M.D.,\1\ DIRECTOR, CHILDREN AND _x000D_
                      FAMILY FUTURES, INC._x000D_
_x000D_
    Dr. Young: Thank you. And, thank you, Senator Portman and _x000D_
Senator Brown, for having the hearing and your continued _x000D_
support on these issues and the CARA Act._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Young appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 173._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Each year the number of infants who have been prenatally _x000D_
exposed to illicit drugs, binge drinking and heavy alcohol is _x000D_
about 360,000, the population of Butler County, each year._x000D_
    I would like to emphasize four points from my written _x000D_
statement._x000D_
    In the past three decades, our country has experienced at _x000D_
least three major shifts in substances of abuse that have had a _x000D_
dramatic impact on children and families, but particularly on _x000D_
the child welfare system._x000D_
    While the increase of opioid misuse has been described as _x000D_
having the worst effects, unfortunately, as reported in _x000D_
governing just last week, we have to begin to anticipate the _x000D_
synthetics, such as bath salts and spice, which are beginning _x000D_
to kill people in a very different way than the overdose, but _x000D_
are increasingly being manufactured, marketed and used._x000D_
    The point is that irregardless of the drug of the decade, _x000D_
child welfare agencies see some of its worst effects. And, _x000D_
despite the history and the known cost of substance use _x000D_
disorder on child welfare, the response has not been systemic. _x000D_
It has not been with funding changes to adequately address the _x000D_
problem. Instead, we have offered demonstration grants and _x000D_
pilot programs._x000D_
    While worthwhile, to understand what works, we need to be _x000D_
at that systemic level of understanding how to take these _x000D_
initiatives statewide._x000D_
    My second point is that the current opioid crisis, as is _x000D_
all too well-known in Ohio, means that young people are dying _x000D_
at astonishing rates too often leaving young children. _x000D_
Grandparents and other kinship providers are taking in these _x000D_
children--sometimes with little support or assistance._x000D_
    We recently analyzed the Federal Adoption and Foster Care _x000D_
Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data set and found that _x000D_
children who were placed in protective custody, because of _x000D_
their parent's alcohol or drug problem, are most frequently _x000D_
placed in kinship placements, rather than other type of foster _x000D_
care or group homes._x000D_
    Another effect of opioids on child welfare services is the _x000D_
alarming increase in infants who are coming into protective _x000D_
custody. In 2014, 45,000 infants were placed in protective _x000D_
custody, the most recent year that data are available._x000D_
    Specific to opioids, thank you again for your support of _x000D_
protecting our Infants Act. I understand the report to Congress _x000D_
is underway in the administration._x000D_
    But, the Federal law intended to protect these infants, the _x000D_
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), requires _x000D_
medical providers to notify child protective services of _x000D_
infants identified as affected by prenatal substance exposure. _x000D_
However, it is not consistently implemented. And, child welfare _x000D_
agencies do not have clarity about how best to meet these _x000D_
families' needs._x000D_
    Last week, the Administration on Children, Youth and _x000D_
Families (ACYF) issued program instructions for States to more _x000D_
fully describe their State laws and policies and then _x000D_
procedures for these infants. Clearly a view of the current _x000D_
legislation and funding mechanisms to provide safe care for _x000D_
these infants is now essential._x000D_
    But, we also need to recognize that CAPTA funding for this _x000D_
provision is approximately $25 million nationwide, which in _x000D_
some States, it is about half of one State employee._x000D_
    The response to the effects on these infants is essentially _x000D_
an unfunded mandate that to date has not been implemented and _x000D_
in the wake of increasing NAS no longer seems adequate._x000D_
    The urgent policy issues here are clarifying how to _x000D_
implement the CAPTA law, expanding treatment access by _x000D_
appropriating funds for CARA, for example, and most important, _x000D_
ensuring that child welfare financing is flexible enough to _x000D_
allow keeping infants with their families whenever possible by _x000D_
ensuring treatment access and in-home preventive services._x000D_
    My third topic is the good news on what we know about what _x000D_
works. Federal investments over the past decade have tested _x000D_
collaborative strategies in nearly 100 communities. And, those _x000D_
investments consistently produced better outcomes for these _x000D_
families._x000D_
    To simplify, we have determined that there are seven core _x000D_
common strategies implemented in communities which lead to _x000D_
improved outcomes in five Rs._x000D_
    Recovery. The children remain at home. They reunify. We _x000D_
have dramatic decrease in recurrence and decrease of return to _x000D_
care, about a third of standard services. These positive _x000D_
results are detailed in my written statement._x000D_
    Implementing these priority strategies is underway in Ohio _x000D_
as a result of a grant from the Department of Justice's Office _x000D_
of Juvenile and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) as a grant to _x000D_
the Ohio Supreme Court. OJJDP selected five States to show how _x000D_
these ingredients of better practice can be implemented on a _x000D_
larger scale by creating systems change throughout the juvenile _x000D_
court docket._x000D_
    I have been privileged--I feel like Ohio is my second home. _x000D_
I am here about every other month and on the phone every week _x000D_
with a State team that is devoted to expanding these kinds of _x000D_
practices across the State, with 12 communities that have been _x000D_
selected as pilots._x000D_
    And, over this past 18 months, we have been focused on _x000D_
implementing these seven key ingredients and working on the _x000D_
data systems to monitor outcomes. Next spring, Ohio will be one _x000D_
of those five States that will compete for funds for full _x000D_
implementation of the plans that they have made in the last 2 _x000D_
years. Finally knowing that Federal investments have generated _x000D_
a knowledge base of effective approaches and demonstration _x000D_
grants, pilot programs and Title IV-E waivers, we now have _x000D_
clear policy choices._x000D_
    Improving data collection and monitoring. Building on the _x000D_
lessons from the prior Federal investments to take these _x000D_
initiatives to scale in the States. Solve the current gap in _x000D_
timely treatment access._x000D_
    Funding CARA, as you know, is critical, as well as _x000D_
providing child welfare with the resources they need to pay for _x000D_
substance abuse and mental health treatment for parents, _x000D_
including those families with a baby affected by prenatal _x000D_
substance exposure._x000D_
    And, preventing future crises and costs as substance abuse _x000D_
patterns change over time, by providing the flexible funding _x000D_
that is needed by child welfare to meet the needs of families _x000D_
before infants are removed. When we assure timely access to _x000D_
effective treatment, families recover, kids stay safe at home, _x000D_
and we save money. Now, we can and we must move beyond these _x000D_
pilots and demonstrations and take these lessons into systemic _x000D_
changes across agencies for all of our children and families._x000D_
    Thank you so much for your time._x000D_

   TESTIMONY OF MARGARET KOTZ, D.O.,\1\ DIRECTOR, ADDICTION _x000D_
RECOVERY SERVICES, UH CASE MEDICAL CENTER, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS_x000D_
_x000D_
    Dr. Kotz: Chairman Portman and Senator Brown, thank you for _x000D_
the privilege of being here today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Kotz appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 201._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I am an addiction psychiatrist at University Hospitals. _x000D_
And, my background is, is that I have been in the field of _x000D_
addiction psychiatry for over 30 years. Recently, I have been _x000D_
heavily involved with national agencies, such as the Substance _x000D_
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and _x000D_
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and recently spoke with _x000D_
Agent Jess, and worked with professional organizations to _x000D_
develop regulations and guidelines, as well as policies for _x000D_
treatment of opioid disorders._x000D_
    I share the concerns of all of our previous speakers and _x000D_
legislations that opioid addiction is destroying the lives and _x000D_
communities of many Ohioans._x000D_
    You have heard previously, too, that this disease was _x000D_
previously thought to mainly affect impoverished males in _x000D_
inner-cities. However, the current epidemic affecting suburban _x000D_
women, well to do professionals and adolescents in privileged _x000D_
environments has reminded us that the disease of addiction does _x000D_
not discriminate._x000D_
    I would like to discuss the role of medication assisted _x000D_
treatment. Studies show that when heroin addiction is treated _x000D_
only with abstinence and psychosocial treatment, that most _x000D_
fail._x000D_
    Our 50 years of experience with methadone to treat heroin _x000D_
addiction confirms that counterintuitively the use of a _x000D_
selected opioid to treat opioid addiction results in decreased _x000D_
unemployment, criminality and infectious diseases such as Human _x000D_
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C._x000D_
    However, while effective, methadone is not an option for _x000D_
the overwhelming majority of patients with opioid addiction. It _x000D_
requires daily visits to specially licensed facilities, _x000D_
typically only found in large urban locations. It is completely _x000D_
inaccessible to rural patients and relatively so to those _x000D_
living at a distance in the cities, especially when _x000D_
transportation is limited. The daily visits are a barrier to _x000D_
employment._x000D_
    Since the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000), _x000D_
Office Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT), has been available, the _x000D_
partial opioid agonist buprenorphine can be prescribed by _x000D_
qualified primary care providers, by a physician, in the _x000D_
patient's neighborhood, making it significantly more _x000D_
accessible. Daily visits are not needed, so that the patients _x000D_
can work more easily._x000D_
    Research demonstrates that it is as effective as methadone _x000D_
and far safer in case of overdose or child exposure. Even so, _x000D_
access remains severely limited, due to inadequate numbers of _x000D_
physicians prescribing buprenorphine._x000D_
    An alternate medication based strategy for treatment relies _x000D_
not on opioids, but rather an antagonist medication that blocks _x000D_
opioids. Only one--naltrexone--is currently available as a _x000D_
daily pill or a monthly injection. While less acceptable to _x000D_
many patients than buprenorphine, for those willing to take it _x000D_
or who have monitored administration, it can be a valuable tool _x000D_
for increasing long term sobriety._x000D_
    Although opioid agonist and antagonist medications are _x000D_
important additions to our treatment armamentarium, they are _x000D_
not in and of themselves sufficient for successful treatment. _x000D_
This is especially true when a primary care provider has 15 _x000D_
minutes to provide addiction treatment, while also complying _x000D_
with requirements to ensure that other issues, such as _x000D_
vaccinations and colonoscopies are up to date._x000D_
    So, what we need is support for extended office visits and _x000D_
for associated behavioral services to be and to have essential _x000D_
favorable outcomes._x000D_
    It is imperative that we train more doctors to include _x000D_
medication assisted treatment, and that we ensure that there is _x000D_
payment for both medical and behavioral services._x000D_
    In Northeast Ohio, there are simply not enough facilities _x000D_
or behavioral services to treat addiction for those who need _x000D_
it. And, when space is available, insurance often fails to pay _x000D_
for it. Or, perversely, patients are required to fail a level _x000D_
of care or a medication before the appropriate treatment will _x000D_
be considered._x000D_
    In summary, a current epidemic, our current epidemic is _x000D_
having a catastrophic impact on many lives in our communities. _x000D_
We are fortunate that both of our Ohio Senators are taking _x000D_
action to address this scourge. Senator Portman was a co-author _x000D_
of the act. And, Senator Brown has been a ferocious supporter _x000D_
of it._x000D_
    I am a proud member of our Heroin Task Force in Northeast _x000D_
Ohio. However, I also think that it is likely that an approach _x000D_
at the Federal level will be necessary to stem the tide of _x000D_
opioid addiction._x000D_

_x000D_
    Ms. Metz: Senator Brown, Chairman Portman, fellow speakers, _x000D_
and guests, thank you for allowing me to speak to you regarding _x000D_
the opioid epidemic and its devastating impact on Cuyahoga _x000D_
County. The MetroHealth System is an essential hospital system _x000D_
committed to leveraging its expertise, resources, and _x000D_
relationships to respond to this public health crisis. I serve _x000D_
as Program Coordinator for MetroHealth Cuyahoga County Project _x000D_
DAWN, a lifesaving overdose prevention program sponsored by the _x000D_
health system, the Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health _x000D_
Services Board of Cuyahoga County and the Ohio Department of _x000D_
Health (ODH). I am also speaking to you as a member of the _x000D_

    These committees convene many local experts, such as _x000D_
Project DAWN Medical Director, Dr. Joan Papp, the Cleveland _x000D_
Clinic's Dr. Jason Jerry, County Drug Court Judges David Matia _x000D_
and Joan Synenberg, Dr. Gilson, our County Medical Examiner, _x000D_
and even Erin Helms who manages recovery housing in our _x000D_
community and many others in order to address this crisis by _x000D_
collaborating with government, law enforcement, education and _x000D_
prevention and addiction experts._x000D_
    Our country is in the grips of an opiate addiction and _x000D_
overdose epidemic. We are at risk of losing a generation of _x000D_
Americans to disease that devastates lives, families and entire _x000D_
communities. In 2014, 2,482 Ohioans died as a result of a drug _x000D_
overdose, where 80 percent of these fatalities involved an _x000D_
opioid. In large part, our country's epidemic is iatrogenic. _x000D_
Our liberal prescribing of opioids has created a generation of _x000D_
Americans who are addicted to opioids and require help. As a _x000D_
nation, we must mobilize to curb and fix this crisis._x000D_
    At Project DAWN, we work to reduce opioid overdose _x000D_
mortality by helping to expand community access to the opioid _x000D_
overdose antidote naloxone. We train community members on risk _x000D_
factors for overdose, how to recognize an overdose and how to _x000D_
respond to an opioid overdose. The most critical aspect of our _x000D_
program is the free provision of naloxone to our patients. _x000D_
Since Dr. Joan Papp founded our county program in March 2013, _x000D_
we have provided over 3,300 kits to community members resulting _x000D_
in over 430 overdose rescues that we are aware of alone._x000D_
    Ohio's streets are saturated with fentanyl-laced heroin, _x000D_
which has contributed to the loss of 502 Ohioans during 2014, _x000D_
as compared to 84 during 2013. Because fentanyl is an opioid _x000D_
that is up to 50 times stronger than heroin, the dose of _x000D_
naloxone needed to revive the victim must be increased. This _x000D_
development is impacting our intervention efforts and budget _x000D_
because it is increasingly necessary to provide additional take _x000D_
home doses to our patients._x000D_
    We and other alcohol, drug and mental health service _x000D_
providers in our country do not have the adequate resources to _x000D_
meet the emerging needs of communities struggling with _x000D_
substance use disorders. Cuyahoga County Project DAWN is _x000D_
actually considered one of the largest Project DAWN programs in _x000D_
Ohio. We have expanded to include 3 to 4 hour walk-in clinics 3 _x000D_
days a week. And, also, started to provide naloxone kits in _x000D_
other community settings, such as the county jail, MetroHealth _x000D_
emergency departments and the Free Medical Clinic of Greater _x000D_
Cleveland's syringe exchange program. Without these strong _x000D_
community collaborations, we would not be able to save as many _x000D_
lives. Currently Project DAWN's efforts are shouldered by one _x000D_
full-time employee, me. In Ohio, we are one of 37 Project DAWN _x000D_
programs in a State of 88 counties. The reality is that many of _x000D_
these programs do not have full-time staff members, and some _x000D_
are only able to operate once a month. And, often, there are _x000D_
programs that run out of funds to purchase naloxone before the _x000D_
year's end._x000D_
    Project DAWN programs are essential to curbing opioid _x000D_
overdose mortality at the community level, because we equip _x000D_
those most likely to witness an overdose with the proper _x000D_
lifesaving tools. While we strongly support increasing access _x000D_
to naloxone for first responders, including police, fire and _x000D_
EMS, we know that the most likely individuals to witness an _x000D_
overdose are actually drug users, their family and their _x000D_
friends._x000D_
    We strongly support the Comprehensive Addiction and _x000D_
Recovery Act and request funding be considered to help lay _x000D_
responders who are connected to Project DAWN models. This _x000D_
investment will sustain and expand community based naloxone _x000D_
programs that have a proven track record in reaching people in _x000D_
the community before they intersect with the first responder _x000D_
system._x000D_
    We applaud our Congressional leadership for recognizing _x000D_
that increasing naloxone access in our country does not alone _x000D_
fix the opioid epidemic. The CARA legislation is promising, in _x000D_
that it promotes evidence based and innovative strategies, _x000D_
interventions and treatments at the community level. Project _x000D_
DAWN welcomes Federal funding in support of community networks _x000D_
focusing on connecting treatment, housing, education and _x000D_
employment opportunities to those struggling with addiction._x000D_
    Finally, the stigma that is present in our country for _x000D_
individuals, as you have heard from others, is no small issue _x000D_
to tackle. We commend CARA's focus on public awareness _x000D_
campaigns, which would educate the public on the risk of _x000D_
prescription drugs and heroin abuse. We hope these campaigns _x000D_
will also educate the public that addiction is a chronic _x000D_
disease. And, we should support those in recovery, just as we _x000D_
rally behind those who face other diseases. Individuals with _x000D_
substance use disorders are not bad people trying to get good. _x000D_
Instead they are sick people trying to get well._x000D_
    Thank you for your time and allowing me to serve on this _x000D_
panel."

       TESTIMONY OF ROB BRANDT,\1\ FOUNDER, ROBBY'S VOICE_x000D_
_x000D_
    Mr. Brandt: So, I want to thank Senator Brown and Senator _x000D_
Portman for the opportunity to present this testimony today, as _x000D_
well as for your work on the CARA legislation._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Brandt appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 214._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    On October 20, 2011, my son Robby passed away from a heroin _x000D_
overdose. His addiction started with a prescription for pain _x000D_
medication after he had his wisdom teeth taken out. It grew _x000D_
because of the availability of prescription pain medications in _x000D_
school. And, it ultimately led to his addiction to heroin. As a _x000D_
family, we battled the disease as best we could. But, we lacked _x000D_
information. We lacked education. We lacked awareness to the _x000D_
resources that may have been available that may have helped us _x000D_
save his life. But, our deficit of education really began well _x000D_
before his addiction. And, it began with the lack of education _x000D_
in the schools, to the students, where they do not fear the _x000D_
drugs or that the stigma is not scary, and the lack of _x000D_
awareness at the community level, which allows us as parents to _x000D_
continue to live under the false pretense that it is not going _x000D_
to be our kid._x000D_
    In May 2012, we started Robby's Voice in an effort to raise _x000D_
awareness at schools and efforts to raise awareness in the _x000D_
communities. And, since then, we have spoken to over 75,000 _x000D_
people in the schools, in communities, in rehabs. And, we are _x000D_
currently working on turnkey programs for schools, as well as _x000D_
developing a center for continued recovery for post treatment._x000D_
    But, the reality of it is--it is not why we started Robby's _x000D_
Voice. We started Robby's Voice because it was his dream. We _x000D_
started Robby's Voice because, when we went on this road of _x000D_
addiction, we had no clue. We did not know what to do. We did _x000D_
not know where to turn. We did not know how to deal with it._x000D_
    And, it does split the family. And, the only thing worse _x000D_
than living with an addict is the death of a child. And, you _x000D_
cannot fix that._x000D_
    So, today, I speak to you as a parent who has lived with an _x000D_
addict, as a parent who has lost a child, and as a parent who _x000D_
has been on the front lines for the past 4 years fighting the _x000D_
battle. Robby did not want to be an addict. He said it over and _x000D_
over. He could not escape it. We could not protect him. And, in _x000D_
the end, we lost him. And so, because of that, we believe _x000D_
strongly that prevention is the ultimate answer. Prevention _x000D_
strikes at demand. Law enforcement strikes at supply. _x000D_
Prevention strikes at demand. If there is no buyer, there is no _x000D_
one for the seller to sell to._x000D_
    Prevention means that we have to take a good hard look at _x000D_
causation--things like pain as a vital sign. Pain is _x000D_
subjective. And, pain can be traced back to the beginning of _x000D_
this epidemic. We have to look at things like the Affordable _x000D_
Care Act and the payment structure that promotes prescribing _x000D_
because of patient satisfaction surveys. We have to be able to _x000D_
sever payment from pain._x000D_
    Prevention addresses the concepts of choice and _x000D_
consequence. And, it is going to allow us to escape this _x000D_
epidemic, and it is going to allow us to avoid the next one. To _x000D_
that, education is the cornerstone of a prevention strategy. _x000D_
Education will drive a critical change in culture. And, _x000D_
education will drive the change in the stigma that we deal with _x000D_
every day in society. Education has to be comprehensive. It has _x000D_
to be Kindergarten through 12th grade. It has to expand beyond _x000D_
just science in other classrooms and other curriculums. It has _x000D_
to extend to the teachers. It has to extend to the support _x000D_
staffs. It has to extend to the parents who are the missing _x000D_
link in this._x000D_
    We speak at schools all the time. And, what we hear is, we _x000D_
do not have the time, because we have standardized tests. We do _x000D_
not have the money. We do not have the resource. And, as a _x000D_
result, most of the schools that we speak in do not have _x000D_
comprehensive sustainable education plans. We have to educate _x000D_
across the spectrum. We have to educate in the communities. We _x000D_
have to educate in law enforcement._x000D_
    We still get mixed messages from the police department. Are _x000D_
the police departments in the arrest and prosecute mode or are _x000D_
they in the treatment mode? And, it is mixed in the _x000D_
communities. We only have 46 police departments in the State of _x000D_
Ohio that are carrying Narcan. And, I can tell you it is not _x000D_
because of just the cost. I have had police officers look me in _x000D_
the eye and tell me, we just do not know if we should save _x000D_
these people._x000D_
    We cannot miss our opportunity to educate at the point of _x000D_
origin, whether it is the point that the prescription is _x000D_
written or at the point of dispense at the pharmacy. We also _x000D_
have a 70 to 90 percent failure rate in treatment. And, that _x000D_
frankly is a support issue._x000D_
    As a society, we provide support for chronic diseases like _x000D_
cancer and diabetes and obesity. Yet with addiction, we do not _x000D_
have the necessary resources, nor the necessary funds to _x000D_
provide the support that is needed to sustain sobriety. And, as _x000D_
a result, we unknowingly continue to enable relapse._x000D_
    Support also has to extend beyond the addict to the family. _x000D_
We call addiction a family disease, yet we focus our treatment _x000D_
and our treatment dollars solely on the addict, while the _x000D_
families are at home enabling relapse, enabling addiction._x000D_
    So, the question really becomes is what can the Federal _x000D_
Government do to help us? And, in our opinion, we believe the _x000D_
Federal Government can help us not only create, but employ a _x000D_
comprehensive strategy. This is a national issue. And, you have _x000D_
a national perspective. But, more importantly than that, we _x000D_
believe that the Federal Government can help us move with the _x000D_
sense of urgency, a sense of purpose. The cost of addiction we _x000D_
measure in billions of dollars. But, the cost of addiction is _x000D_
not the dollars. It is the cost of the community, and it is the _x000D_
cost to the fabric of our families._x000D_
    We are going to lose 120 Americans today. We are going to _x000D_
lose 120 Americans every day until we move. And, we measure _x000D_
that statistic as well. See, that is not a statistic. But, _x000D_
those 120, they are moms and dads. They are brothers, they are _x000D_
sisters, and they are sons and daughters. And, that is what has _x000D_
to stop._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924650,2924649,2924651,19235,13,"    Thank you, Mr. Brandt. I really appreciate _x000D_
your willingness to be here and channel your grief that you and _x000D_
your family have experienced into something so constructive. I _x000D_
am going to start with a question about these kids. And, Dr. _x000D_
Walsh, you talked about the fact that we need more research _x000D_
into what the long term effects are._x000D_
    Do you agree that we also need more research into how to _x000D_
try to avoid those long terms effects?_x000D_
    In other words, although I know your neonatal unit here is _x000D_
at the cutting edge--one of the best in the entire world--I _x000D_
have also been at other hospitals that do not have that _x000D_
expertise, here, in Ohio. And, I know you have been generous to _x000D_
bring in babies from not just this region, but from around the _x000D_
State and, indeed, across State lines._x000D_
    But, what do you think needs to be done in terms of the _x000D_
research, first, to determine what the long term impact is, _x000D_
and, second, how to avoid these impacts?"
2924651,2924650,2924652,19235,13,"    Well, Chairman Portman, as usual you ask the _x000D_
salient question. The babies are the downstream. They are just _x000D_
the tiniest part of this horrible epidemic. And so, prevention _x000D_
is what it is all about. And, moving upstream to have more _x000D_
comprehensive treatment programs is, I think, the appropriate _x000D_
method. And so, using public health language, a primary _x000D_
prevention strategy through education in the schools. But, also _x000D_
then, if a woman has a substance abuse disorder, urging a life _x000D_
planning process, so that they avoid pregnancy while they are _x000D_
seeking treatment and in recovery._x000D_
    The research that we need on the infants, obviously, is _x000D_
long term. So, we need to understand how are they doing in _x000D_
early childhood and at school age. It is not difficult._x000D_
    Sadly, we have way too many babies in Ohio to be able to do _x000D_
this study. In the 18 months that we have been working _x000D_
throughout the State, we have treated over 4,000 newborns with _x000D_
opiates for NAS. And, another 4,000, who we were able to manage _x000D_
without opiate exposure._x000D_
    The bigger question that concerns me is that, if you have a _x000D_
genetic predisposition to addiction--and the baby shares those _x000D_
same genetics as the mom--are these infants then--have they _x000D_
been changed, in the womb, to even enhance that genetic _x000D_
predisposition? And, that is going to take even decades of _x000D_
research to be able to answer that question."
2924652,2924651,2924653,19235,13,"    As you say, this is only, not, relatively, _x000D_
a new phenomenon--and it is overwhelming in our neonatal units. _x000D_
But, it is time for us to do this research, immediately, to be _x000D_
able to save these kids. So that they do not have to go to _x000D_
school unable to concentrate or to learn, which is some of what _x000D_
I hear, anecdotally, from some of the teachers--elementary _x000D_
school teachers--who are experiencing these kids coming into _x000D_
their classrooms. And, how do we help with that?_x000D_
    Dr. Young, you talked a little about this. And, one of the _x000D_
things that has always concerned me is this coordination you _x000D_
mentioned in your testimony between child protective services _x000D_
and the neonatal abstinence syndrome. Just to be clear, because _x000D_
I am not sure I understand this, are child protective services _x000D_
(CPS) contacted when there is a child who comes out of the _x000D_
hospital and has been diagnosed with neonatal abstinence _x000D_
syndrome?"
2924653,2924652,2924654,19235,13,"    The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, it _x000D_
says that they are to. But, we know that there are vast _x000D_
discrepancies in how that is implemented._x000D_
    Last week was the first time that there were program _x000D_
instructions to ask the child welfare agencies to describe what _x000D_
their policies and procedures are once that referral is made._x000D_
    We have six States with the National Center on Substance _x000D_
Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW)--six States that we are _x000D_
working with, specifically, on this coordination between _x000D_
hospitals, obstetricians, child welfare agencies, the courts, _x000D_
and treatment agencies. And, we have detailed some of the _x000D_
reasons that obstetricians, in particular, and hospitals tell _x000D_
us, in terms of why those reports are not made._x000D_
    Two States--New Jersey and Virginia--are in the process of _x000D_
surveying all of their birthing hospitals in order to get a _x000D_
better handle on what those issues are, as to why infants are _x000D_
either not detected or not referred or not followed up with._x000D_
    So, there is a host of issues. And, I would be happy to _x000D_
follow up with some of those details from those States that we _x000D_
are working with."
2924654,2924653,2924655,19235,13,"    We would love to see that data._x000D_
    CARA, as you know, authorizes and reauthorizes some _x000D_
programs in this area for pregnant women and postpartum women. _x000D_
And, I know you have been supportive of that. And, you have _x000D_
testified about that, and even in the Senate Finance Committee. _x000D_
But, it seems to me, this is an opportunity, I guess, to go _x000D_
past--to not just provide----"
2924655,2924654,2924656,19235,13,"    Right._x000D_
more research into those."
2924656,2924655,2924657,19235,13,    Right.
2924657,2924656,2924658,19235,13,"    Because we have a real problem. And, I _x000D_
agree with what Mr. Brandt said about prevention and education. _x000D_
Again, I have been at this for many years. But, we have these _x000D_
kids."
2924658,2924657,2924659,19235,13,    Right.
2924659,2924658,2924660,19235,13,"    And, they are moving their way through the _x000D_
system right now."
2924660,2924659,2924661,19235,13,"    Correct. Several years ago, we looked at the _x000D_
independent living programs, because we know that these are _x000D_
kids that are at a substantial higher risk of developing their _x000D_
own substance use disorder. And, sadly, we did not find _x000D_
information about addiction, about being the child of a person _x000D_
with a substance use disorder in the independent living _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    So, I think foster youths tell us over and over, first I _x000D_
wish you would have helped my parent. And, second, I did not _x000D_
know what I was dealing with._x000D_
    So, much of what we are looking at when communities come _x000D_
together and actually try and work across these systems is _x000D_
parent/child interventions that address both of those issues."
2924661,2924660,2924662,19235,13,"    Try to keep the child in the home, _x000D_
ultimately?"
2924662,2924661,2924663,19235,13,"    Keep the child in the home. But, also, after _x000D_
unification--or if they are at home--that the parenting class _x000D_
is a two generation program. That it is prevention for the _x000D_
child at the same time that it is a parenting program for the _x000D_
parent._x000D_
    And, if I could just follow up on the long term _x000D_
consequences. It is an area that I looked at pretty _x000D_
extensively, previously. And, most of the research would say _x000D_
that alcohol and tobacco are the two substances that have the _x000D_
most long term developmental consequences, particularly related _x000D_
to alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorders._x000D_
    So, when you hold those things constant, even the things _x000D_
that we thought were going to happen with cocaine and _x000D_
methamphetamine--and the prior research from the prior heroin _x000D_
epidemic in the 60s followed kids up to about 5 and 6 years _x000D_
old. And, when you controlled for those other substances, _x000D_
poverty and change in out of home placement, it does not look _x000D_
like there is an effect of that substance in and of itself._x000D_
    What we have to be mindful of are first substances and the _x000D_
neurodevelopmental effects of alcohol. And, second, what that _x000D_
postnatal environment is, and the continuity of care for the _x000D_
postnatal environment, particularly for kids who are placed in _x000D_
out of home care and the frequent changes in foster care _x000D_
placements."
2924663,2924662,2924664,19235,13,"    That data is needed. I have heard this as _x000D_
well. That fetal alcohol syndrome has had more----"
2924664,2924663,2924665,19235,13,"    Oh, yes."
2924665,2924664,2924666,19235,13,"    Oh, yes."
2924666,2924665,2924667,19235,13,    We know that clearly now----
2924667,2924666,2924668,19235,13,"    Attention span and so on._x000D_
studies that were done during the cocaine epidemic, in _x000D_
particular."
2924668,2924667,2924669,19235,13,"    That might be a slice of better news, and _x000D_
the ability to really be able to----"
2924669,2924668,2924670,19235,13,"    Right._x000D_
get these kids in the right environment."
2924670,2924669,2924671,19235,13,    Correct.
2924671,2924670,2924672,19235,13,"    And, to be able to make their lives full."
2924672,2924671,2924673,19235,13,    Right.
2924673,2924672,2924674,19235,13,"    In a lot of bad news, that is the _x000D_
relatively better news._x000D_
    I have a couple other questions. But, I am going to ask _x000D_
Senator Brown if he would want to ask some questions. I know he _x000D_
has another commitment, as do all of you I am sure. But, again, _x000D_
thank you all for being here. I may come back for a second _x000D_
round."
2924674,2924673,2924675,19235,13,"    I think one of the biggest things we get wrong _x000D_
is this perception. We just had this conversation the other _x000D_
night. When you look at the news coverage of addiction--and it _x000D_
is on every day--what do we see? We see death. We see crime. We _x000D_
see arrests._x000D_
    And, it continues to paint the picture of these addicts as _x000D_
bad people--bad kids. And, they are not. These are good people. _x000D_
These are good kids that are being driven to these actions out _x000D_
of a sense of desperation--driven by a disease that they could _x000D_
not comprehend--that has changed their brain chemistry and that _x000D_
is driving this desperation. So, we create this stigma in _x000D_
society. And, as a result, it drives our perceptions. And, that _x000D_
is, I think, one thing that is critical._x000D_
    Then, the other thing is, again, it is cohesion strategy. _x000D_
It is parent involvement. I was at an event last night in a _x000D_
community of 10,000 people. About 200 plus people showed up--_x000D_
really good showing. We had Drug Abuse Resistance Education _x000D_
(DARE) officers from multiple communities there._x000D_
    And, you know who was not there? Not one single _x000D_
representative from the schools. Not one. So, we lack some _x000D_
cohesion relative to our strategies._x000D_
    But, I think really one of the biggest deficits we have are _x000D_
the parents. We did a parents event in a community one evening. _x000D_
And, we had two parents show up. The next day we did the high _x000D_
school. And, nine kids went to guidance and asked for help. _x000D_
That is a disconnect. So, we have to do a better job of getting _x000D_
the information out._x000D_
    So, relative to the work we do, we spend a lot of time _x000D_
going into schools--whether it is elementary schools or high _x000D_
schools. And, we have a program for the schools that focuses on _x000D_
choice and consequence and information._x000D_
    We are working on sustainable messaging, because it cannot _x000D_
be one time hits. It cannot be once a year. So, we are _x000D_
developing posters, things that the students can do to have _x000D_
student leadership. We do the same thing with parents _x000D_
organizations._x000D_
    But, really our big focus right now is recognizing that we _x000D_
have a massive relapse rate. We have a massive relapse rate._x000D_
    So, we are in the process of jumping on board with the _x000D_
recovery communities and looking at a center for continued _x000D_
community, where we can allow recovering addicts to have a _x000D_
place to come where they fit, where they feel comfortable. They _x000D_
are not sitting at home alone. Where we can help them with _x000D_
that, secondary education, post secondary education, coping _x000D_
skills, goal setting schools, resume writing, dressing for _x000D_
interviews, interview skills. We want to get down the road to _x000D_
develop sober employees. And so, much of that is just linked to _x000D_
helping communities lift the stigma off through education."
2924675,2924674,2924676,19235,13,"    So, through the Ohio Perinatal Quality _x000D_
Collaborative (OPQC), we worked with an advertising firm that _x000D_
only does public health messaging. And, we have created a _x000D_
number of informational pieces that are directed at the _x000D_
pregnant women and encouraging them to seek help._x000D_
    And, we have some messaging that we are partnering with the _x000D_
treatment programs, maintenance treatment programs to have that _x000D_
information there, and say, this is where you are entitled to _x000D_
free prenatal care. This is how you can sign up for Medicaid, _x000D_
for coverage. Because it is Medicaid that covers over 85 _x000D_
percent of these births. And, just reaching out to encourage _x000D_
them to get into care._x000D_
    The States that have made that criminal have seen about a _x000D_
60 percent drop in the number of women seeking prenatal care. _x000D_
And so, now you have only the hit of substance exposure, but _x000D_
now you do not even have the routine prenatal care and _x000D_
prevention that any pregnant woman would have. And so, those _x000D_
babies are doubly affected."
2924676,2924675,2924677,19235,13,"    I think it is a complex situation. And, I was at _x000D_
the Senate hearing that I think, in 2003, asked that the limit _x000D_
be moved from 30 to 100._x000D_
    The problem is that over half of the physicians in this _x000D_
country, who are waivered and eligible to prescribe, are not. _x000D_
And, that is based on several reasons._x000D_
    One, is that there are not behavioral services that are _x000D_
paid for to go along with it._x000D_
    And, the other thing is, for a primary care physician--_x000D_
again, as I said, if they are to get involved with medication _x000D_
assisted treatment, like buprenorphine, they have to be able _x000D_
to, one, refer, which is not happening. And, two, they have to _x000D_
be able to be paid for the time that they are taking to do it. _x000D_
So, again, I think addiction treatment is terrifically _x000D_
underfunded. And, that is why there is such a huge barrier to _x000D_
access._x000D_
    My opinion in some of the professional national _x000D_
organizations I am involved with that have been working with _x000D_
the Federal agencies--there has to be a sensible number._x000D_
    The numbers that have been thrown out there, like one _x000D_
physician to be capped at 500, I think is going to lead to a _x000D_
lot more diversion. And, one--even one physician without an _x000D_
infrastructure cannot take care of 100 patients._x000D_
    So, when you are talking about increasing the cap or the _x000D_
limit, currently I think the Department of Health and Human _x000D_
Services (HHS) is--what they are proposing is increasing it to _x000D_
200._x000D_
    I think that even a tiered approach, where if you are a _x000D_
physician that has an infrastructure with nurse practitioners _x000D_
and with counselors and behavioral services, then you could _x000D_
definitely take care of perhaps more than 100. But, if you do _x000D_
not have that infrastructure, then you are not really going to _x000D_
be providing evidence based care. So, I think there needs to be _x000D_
a reasonable approach to it."
2924677,2924676,2924678,19235,13,"    Just a quick follow up on that. I think _x000D_
you are right, I think it is a complex issue._x000D_
    I was at a treatment center in Dayton, Ohio on Friday _x000D_
talking about this issue. It was a methadone clinic with some _x000D_
suboxone, so it was not one of these physicians. But, I think _x000D_
there is a concern about diversion. And they, as you know, take _x000D_
very careful steps at these treatment centers, including here _x000D_
in Cleveland, to avoid that diversion. But, there is plenty _x000D_
evidence of that happening._x000D_
    So, we do want to continue that, that discussion with you. _x000D_
And, it is not part of the legislation as a result._x000D_
    We do have a study on the issue of how many beds in a _x000D_
residential treatment center, which is another issue I think _x000D_
that needs to be addressed, and we need to expand that. But, _x000D_
the question is bringing in the extras--and that is something _x000D_
that again needs discussion._x000D_
    On medication-assisted treatment, you did not mention _x000D_
Vivitrol or the difference between, sort of, methadone, _x000D_
Suboxone, and Vivitrol--and what works and what does not work._x000D_
    Do you have thoughts on that? Have you had experience with _x000D_
Vivitrol?_x000D_
    We have about 12 pilots around Ohio now. And, some of the _x000D_
drug courts are using it. And, from what they have told me, _x000D_
some have had very good experience._x000D_
    I have also been at round tables with recovering addicts _x000D_
who have acknowledged to me that they have used Vivitrol--and _x000D_
then used other substances--not opioids, but, specifically, _x000D_
cocaine--and it did not work for them. What are your views as _x000D_
an expert?"
2924678,2924677,2924679,19235,13,"    So, when I mentioned agonist, that included _x000D_
methadone and buprenorphine. And, the antagonist I mentioned _x000D_
was naloxone, which is the injectable form of Vivitrol."
2924679,2924678,2924680,19235,13,    Yes.
2924680,2924679,2924681,19235,13,"    So, I think, Vivitrol is definitely a good _x000D_
alternative to agonist therapy. I think it should be used more _x000D_
widely._x000D_
    Again, a lot of it originally had to do with cost. The cost _x000D_
when I first started giving Vivitrol was $1,500. And, most _x000D_
insurances were not paying for that._x000D_
    And, more recently, payers have said that you have to fail _x000D_
oral naloxone before they will consider giving you Vivitrol. _x000D_
So, the preauthorization hassle is enormous. And, also, even _x000D_
the preauthorization for buprenorphine has gotten to be an _x000D_
enormous burden to prescribers._x000D_
    Senator Portman: Actually, I know that it is still _x000D_
considered more expensive. Although, when it is once a month as _x000D_
an injection--if it works--it could arguably be less expensive._x000D_
    And, the timeframe obviously the average time on methadone, _x000D_
for instance, is much longer than Vivitrol. But, on the other _x000D_
hand, it is new. So, we do not have a lot of experience._x000D_
    I appreciate your input on that._x000D_
    And, Ms. Metz, I know we are going to have a chance to talk _x000D_
about this later, and I look forward to seeing your work _x000D_
firsthand. But, this whole issue of Narcan has been talked _x000D_
about a lot today. And, as you know, naloxone, Narcan is a part _x000D_
of this legislation. In other words, not just the firefighters _x000D_
and our police officers, but your organization would benefit _x000D_
from some of the trainings and some of the grants to provide _x000D_
more immediate assistance to save lives. And, that is _x000D_
important._x000D_
    The one thing that troubles me--and I went to Kroger. They _x000D_
asked me to come for their announcement that Kroger was going _x000D_
to go to over-the-counter. And, all I asked them was, ``Well, _x000D_
what are you doing in terms of the consultation or providing _x000D_
people with some information on treatment options? ''_x000D_
    Mr. Brandt talked about frustration he hears from some _x000D_
police officers. And, he did not say this, but I will tell what _x000D_
you they tell me, which is that, sometimes, they are _x000D_
administering it to the same person three, four, or five times. _x000D_
And, their thought is, ``How do you get the person into _x000D_
treatment? ''_x000D_
    That, to me, is the good intention here. How do you _x000D_
actually shift from the safety net--we talked about the guy at _x000D_
McDonald's within a few miles from here. How do you get that _x000D_
person motivated to go into a program to get the treatment--to _x000D_
get the long term recovery that is needed? How do you respond _x000D_
to that?"
2924681,2924680,2924682,19235,13,"    Sure. So, that is definitely a valid question._x000D_
    With regard to relapse, unfortunately, relapse is a part of _x000D_
addiction. So, if people do not survive their relapse, they _x000D_
could never have the opportunity to get into recovery. From my _x000D_
personal experience with this program for about 3 years, most _x000D_
of my patients actually end up saving their friends, who are _x000D_
also drug users. Sometimes I do see, maybe, some folks who have _x000D_
overdosed multiple times._x000D_
    But, most of my patients, when I see them, they are asking _x000D_
me, ``Where do I go for detox and treatment? '' And, that is _x000D_
information that I have readily available for folks. The _x000D_
problem is, the treatment waiting list for detox--for inpatient _x000D_
are months long. And so, we are going to expect people to _x000D_
continue to have an overdose. We want to make sure that they _x000D_
survive to get to that point._x000D_
    We also see folks who are getting out of inpatient _x000D_
treatment programs and are having a relapse almost immediately _x000D_
after getting out of treatment. Because, as Rob mentioned, some _x000D_
of our programs are failing our patients. The relapse rate from _x000D_
inpatient treatment is 90 percent. Now, that is a very high _x000D_
risk individual for overdose and overdose death, because they _x000D_
have no tolerance anymore._x000D_
    If it is heroin that they are going to have an overdose _x000D_
on--perhaps, it is heroin that they use when they have a _x000D_
relapse--but all too often it ends up being fentanyl. So, that _x000D_
is something that we are continuing to be concerned about. And, _x000D_
unfortunately, as I said, relapse is a part of this disease._x000D_
    With regard to our pharmacies, I was involved in actually _x000D_
training all of our Discount Drug Mart pharmacists, who are now _x000D_
carrying naloxone. It is mandated as part of the law for _x000D_
pharmacists to be able to furnish naloxone, that they go _x000D_
through the training similar to what we do._x000D_
    And so, one of the important things that I emphasize in _x000D_
that training is, you want to have all of these treatment _x000D_
resources available to folks. Because, especially with the _x000D_
syringe exchange patients I see, I might be their first entry _x000D_
into the health care system. They might never have been _x000D_
comfortable with asking someone for help. And, they see someone _x000D_
like myself who sees them as an individual and has that _x000D_
information available to them._x000D_
    So, I think that we are actually going to find more _x000D_
opportunities for folks when they go into the pharmacies to be _x000D_
able to ask for treatment. And so, they should be ready with _x000D_
that information. So, I hope that answered your question."
2924682,2924681,2924683,19235,13,"    It does. And, I commend you for that. And, _x000D_
I am glad that in your training that, you help them to find the _x000D_
local treatment and detox center information. And, as you said, _x000D_
one of the big issues we have in Ohio is some of our detox _x000D_
centers do get filled up._x000D_
    Having, ridden with the police officers on this issue, from _x000D_
their perspective, that is their big issue often is that they _x000D_
do not have anyplace to send people. They do not want to arrest _x000D_
our way through this issue. On the other hand, they have to _x000D_
find a place for these people who they pick up who have _x000D_
overdosed._x000D_
    And then, if you are not doing what you are doing, which is _x000D_
to provide these options, I think we are really missing an _x000D_
opportunity. We talked a lot about teachable moments today. _x000D_
That is a teachable moment. And, I have talked to many _x000D_
recovering addicts, who have told me that is when it happened _x000D_
for them--when they overdosed--and two people told me they _x000D_
died. They literally feel like they died. And, I guess in some _x000D_
respects, medically, they might have._x000D_
    One guy told me he saw his father in heaven and came back. _x000D_
And, when he came back, that is when he finally decided he _x000D_
needed to seek treatment._x000D_
    So, I thank you for doing that. And, I hope that we will _x000D_
have a chance to see it today later, but I think that is really _x000D_
important to interact with their pharmacists. I have so many _x000D_
other questions. And, again, I will continue in touch with _x000D_
everybody here._x000D_
    But, just one final one for you, because you have mentioned _x000D_
this. I am not sure everybody picked up on it. But, to use _x000D_
Narcan in its normal dose for fentanyl is not always effective, _x000D_
is that accurate?"
2924683,2924682,2924684,19235,13,"    Yes. The problem with fentanyl, because of its _x000D_
extreme potency, the onset of the overdose is quicker. So, _x000D_
overdoses can occur up to 2 hours or so after somebody uses an _x000D_
opioid with fentanyl. You hear of folks, unfortunately when we _x000D_
have lost our community members, you will hear the needle was _x000D_
still in their arm, something like that. That is a case when it _x000D_
is more likely that it is a fentanyl overdose. Because, _x000D_
literally, the person falls out into the overdose immediately. _x000D_
And so, the response time needs to be quicker. All too often in _x000D_
most cases, the dose of the naloxone must be increased._x000D_
    So, typically sometimes we will find that one or two doses _x000D_
of our two milligram intranasal naloxone might revive somebody _x000D_
who is having just a heroin overdose. We have seen people that _x000D_
need 10 doses of this medicine. Now, that is very important for _x000D_
our program, because we are already stretched in our funding. _x000D_
And, I have patients pretty much every day that I have decided _x000D_
this person is an extremely high risk, they should have more _x000D_
doses._x000D_
    We are at risk of running out of funds through our program _x000D_
now. If you think of a rural community, it takes a long time _x000D_
for the ambulance to get there, if a person is even willing to _x000D_
call 911. Because there is that fear of being arrested or being _x000D_
charged with a drug charge or maybe even being charged with _x000D_
manslaughter, that they supplied that drug to their friend or _x000D_
family member. So, it is an increasing concern for us."
2924684,2924683,2924685,19235,13,"    Well, it is a new challenge. At least, it _x000D_
is a greater challenge than it used to be--particularly, here _x000D_
in Cleveland--and in other areas that have been specifically _x000D_
targeted with fentanyl._x000D_
    And, again, I thank all the witnesses. This is great _x000D_
information here today. I think we have learned two things. _x000D_
One, the comprehensive approach is the only approach._x000D_
    And, I appreciate the fact that many of you helped us get _x000D_
to this point on this one bill, CARA--into our communities _x000D_
quickly. It will help. It will help Emily. It will help Dr. _x000D_
Kotz and Dr. Walsh with what they are doing. It will certainly _x000D_
help Mr. Brandt in what he is courageously doing. And so, we _x000D_
have to get that done._x000D_
    But, then, there is more to do. And, funding has to follow. _x000D_
We did a good job in sort of providing evidence based grant _x000D_
making. But, now you have to have funding that actually follows _x000D_
it. And, I think that is going to be successful this year. But, _x000D_
we have to just keep the pressure on._x000D_
    And, as with every issue, again, I started working on this _x000D_
many years ago--the substance that is being abused will come _x000D_
and go--as is talked about by the experts here today. We tend _x000D_
to take our eye off of the ball. We will never solve the _x000D_
problem entirely. The tide continues to come in. And, to turn _x000D_
that tide requires consistency. So, I got that today, too._x000D_
    And then, finally, the sense that this is a crisis. This is _x000D_
not just we are talking theoretically about stuff we should be _x000D_
doing. This is stuff we have to do in order to save lives and _x000D_
repair our communities and get families back together._x000D_
    So, thank you very much for your testimony. Thank you _x000D_
University Hospital and all of us who are still here for _x000D_
allowing us to use this beautiful room, which will now become _x000D_
the official hearing room for the United States Congress. Thank _x000D_
you._x000D_
    This hearing record will remain open for 15 days until May _x000D_
7 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions for _x000D_
the record. And, the hearing is adjourned."
2924685,2924684,2924686,19236,1,"    This hearing will come to order._x000D_
    I think it would be appropriate to start the day, in light _x000D_
of Memorial Day being yesterday, and in light of the tragedies _x000D_
of some of the finest among us, suffering at the hands of _x000D_
people that should be taking care of them, if we can start this _x000D_
hearing with a moment of silence?_x000D_
    If you will please join me?_x000D_
    Thank you._x000D_
    I would also like to ask anybody who has served in _x000D_
military, and, quite honestly, their family members as well, _x000D_
because this is a service and sacrifice that affects the entire _x000D_
family, if you could please rise and be recognized?_x000D_
    Thank you all for your service and sacrifice. The purpose _x000D_
of this hearing is to make sure that the rest of America honors _x000D_
its promise to you. That's what really is the heart of this _x000D_
hearing. I truly want to thank everybody who as appeared and _x000D_
attended this hearing today._x000D_
    I want to, in particular, thank the surviving family _x000D_
members of Jason Simcakoski, Thomas Baer, Chris Kirkpatrick, _x000D_
and Kraig Ferrington._x000D_
    In March of 2015, we held a hearing where the family _x000D_
members stepped forward and whistleblowers stepped forward and _x000D_
provided powerful testimony. And, it was powerful testimony. We _x000D_
heard from Dr. Noelle Johnson, Mr. Ryan Honl, Marv and Heather _x000D_
Simcakoski, and Candace Delis. I have to believe that their _x000D_
testimony had an effect on the officials that were present that _x000D_
day from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)._x000D_
    It is that type of testimony, it is that type of _x000D_
highlighting a problem that is going to be required if we are _x000D_
going to honor the promises of the finest among us._x000D_
    I do want to thank my staff for doing, I think, an _x000D_
extraordinary job of laying out the findings of a very _x000D_
rigorous, a very comprehensive investigation into how exactly _x000D_
the problems within the Tomah healthcare facility went on for _x000D_
so long without being corrected.\1\_x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The Majority Staff Report appears in the Appendix on page 63._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I do encourage everybody, because I think we have a couple _x000D_
of hundred copies, to grab one and read all 359 pages. It lays _x000D_
out exactly what happened with, quite honestly, not all the _x000D_
information._x000D_
    I do want to say that certainly it has been my experience, _x000D_
because I have traveled around the State of Wisconsin and _x000D_
visited VA healthcare facilities, the vast majority of the _x000D_
doctors, of the nurses, of the administrators are doing an _x000D_
excellent job. They are highly concerned about the finest among _x000D_
us, about our veterans. And, they are doing everything they can _x000D_
to honor those promises._x000D_
    But the fact of the matter is, they are working within a _x000D_
single-payer, government-run bureaucratic healthcare system and _x000D_
there just are inherent problems. For example, inherent _x000D_
problems of accountability. Inherent problems, unfortunately, _x000D_
within an Office of Inspector General (OIG) that was not living _x000D_
up to its mission. Who, I would say, was captured by the VA _x000D_
itself._x000D_
    So, the Office of Inspector General under Richard Griffin _x000D_
was loyal to the VA instead of being loyal to the finest among _x000D_
us and to the American public._x000D_
    This Committee, in particular, the Senate oversight _x000D_
committee, relies on independent and transparent Inspectors _x000D_
General (IGs). Government relies on them. The only hope we have _x000D_
of fixing problems is if you have an Inspector General's office _x000D_
be the independent, transparent watchdog actually doing its _x000D_
job._x000D_
    And, what is very apparent in our 350 page report and the _x000D_
almost 4 or 5,000 supporting documents is that for years the _x000D_
Office of Inspector General from the VA did not do its job._x000D_
    And, what is an even greater tragedy is that these _x000D_
tragedies here at Tomah, I believe, could have been prevented, _x000D_
had the Office of Inspector General done its job._x000D_
    As far back as 2004, Dr. David Houlihan had been referred _x000D_
to as Candy Man. A number of people, as far back as 2008 and _x000D_
2009, were trying to raise the alarm to a number of _x000D_
Departments, a number of Agencies, a number of Offices. And _x000D_
yet, somehow those alarms did not go public._x000D_
    I do want to play real quickly, if people are ready, and _x000D_
you can follow along on page 48, there were logs that Heather _x000D_
Simcakoski asked us to basically use the Capitol Police to get _x000D_
into her husband's cell phone to get a record of his call logs._x000D_
    Now, during the course of our investigations, we contacted _x000D_
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about potential _x000D_
contacts as it related to Tomah VA. They claimed there was no _x000D_
contact. And yet, we actually have a voice from a message left _x000D_
by a member of the FBI, which I would like to play right now if _x000D_
we can._x000D_
    Now, we asked representatives of the FBI and the Drug _x000D_
Enforcement Agency (DEA) to appear today and they declined. _x000D_
They also continue to convey to this Committee, to our staff, _x000D_
that they have no record of ever having been contacted by Jason _x000D_
Simcakoski. I find that puzzling. I find it troubling._x000D_
    Again, the failure of the Office of Inspector General to _x000D_
live up to its mission was really at the root cause of why _x000D_
these problems continued to go on for so long._x000D_
    I do want everybody to refer to page 208 and 209, because I _x000D_
think this is a classic example of how the Office of Inspector _x000D_
General, in their inspection, in their investigation here, _x000D_
narrowed its scope, refused to look beyond its scope, and, as a _x000D_
result, did not do its job._x000D_
    In 2008, according to our report, during its site visit, _x000D_
this is the first site visit directed by Dr. Alan Mallinger to _x000D_
the Tomah VA following reports that began in 2011. The hotline _x000D_
reports. During its site visit to the Tomah Veterans Affairs _x000D_
Medical Center (VAMC), VA Office of Inspector General officials _x000D_
interviewed both Dr. Houlihan and Deborah Frasher. During the _x000D_
interviews, both Office of Inspector General physicians and _x000D_
Special Agent Porter of the VA OIG's criminal division observed _x000D_
that Dr. Houlihan and Ms. Frasher appeared to be impaired._x000D_
    Now, unfortunately, during that initial investigation _x000D_
visit, Mr. Mario DeSanctis was not present. So, the Inspector _x000D_
General's team held a phone conference with Mr. DeSanctis, and _x000D_
in 2009 you can read how they informed Mr. DeSanctis about _x000D_
their concern with Dr. Houlihan and Nurse Frasher potentially _x000D_
being impaired, potentially being drug users. There are _x000D_
numerous whistleblower reports that also suspected that Dr. _x000D_
Houlihan and Nurse Frasher were drug users._x000D_
    I want people to read exactly what they Office of Inspector _x000D_
General did. All they did was inform Mr. DeSanctis and suggest _x000D_
that Mr. DeSanctis perform drug tests on those two individuals. _x000D_
We have no idea whether those drug tests were ever performed. I _x000D_
would think, if they were, back in 2012, these tragedies might _x000D_
have been prevented._x000D_
    So, again, the bottom line of what this report shows is it _x000D_
was the failure of the Office of Inspector General and the _x000D_
failure of other agencies and offices to actually highlight the _x000D_
problems that they were made aware of that allowed these _x000D_
tragedies to occur._x000D_
    And, we will get into this further in terms of the _x000D_
testimony and our questions to it._x000D_
    I do ask that my written prepared statement be entered into _x000D_
the record\1\ without objection._x000D_

    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the _x000D_

    And, with that, to Senator Baldwin."
2924686,2924685,2924687,19236,1,"    Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. I _x000D_
want to thank you for organizing this hearing today and I also _x000D_
want to add my words of appreciation to your staff, Senator _x000D_
Carper's staff and to my staff in terms of the undertaking that _x000D_
resulted in this work product. It is a very significant _x000D_
investment on their part and we appreciate that._x000D_
    I think the fact that we are both here again today sends an _x000D_
important message to this community that we will continue to _x000D_
work across the partisan aisle in order to address the problems _x000D_
at the Tomah VA. In fact, I would describe it as: there is no _x000D_
aisle._x000D_
    As Americans, we are united. We are united by an eternal _x000D_
bond with the families and friends of our fallen. And, we are _x000D_
also united by the sacred trust that we have with our veterans _x000D_
and their families._x000D_
    Today, as we hear the story of how that sacred trust with _x000D_
our veterans and their families has been broken, it is _x000D_
important for us to keep in mind what unites us._x000D_
    One profound thing that I have learned about the tragic _x000D_
problems at the Tomah VA is that veterans, their families, and _x000D_
whistleblowers all want the same thing. They want answers and _x000D_
accountability, but most importantly they want solutions to the _x000D_
problems at the Tomah VA so that these sort of tragedies never _x000D_
ever happen again._x000D_
    What I am committed to is fixing what has been broken. What _x000D_
I am focused on is restoring the sacred trust that we have with _x000D_
our veterans and their families._x000D_
    The Committee's reports makes clear much of what we have _x000D_
known for some time. The problems at the Tomah VA have had _x000D_
tragic and preventable consequences._x000D_
    The report sheds light on the failures surrounding the _x000D_
deaths of Kraig Ferrington, Dr. Christopher Kirkpatrick, Jason _x000D_
Simcakoski and Thomas Baer. What this report can never do is _x000D_
repair the damage that their losses have had on families, many _x000D_
of whom are here with us today._x000D_
    It is just as clear to me today, as it was a long time ago, _x000D_
that the VA prescribed Jason Simcakoski a deadly mix of drugs _x000D_
that led to his death. And, those responsible at the Tomah VA _x000D_
for this tragic failure should have been held accountable long _x000D_
ago. In fact, they should have been accountable before Jason's _x000D_
death._x000D_
    The record is clear, for far too long, serious problems _x000D_
have existed at the Tomah VA and they were simply ignored or _x000D_
not taken seriously, as they should have been, by the VA and _x000D_
the VA Inspector General._x000D_
    My office was just one of many voices who were trying to _x000D_
expose the problems at the VA._x000D_
    When my Senate office was first contacted in March 2014 _x000D_
with complaints about the Tomah VA, including prescribing _x000D_
practices, they came from an anonymous whistleblower. Someone _x000D_
who still remains anonymous today._x000D_
    We immediately brought those concerns to the Tomah VA and _x000D_
then to the VA Office of Inspector General, and then to the _x000D_
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, _x000D_
D.C._x000D_
    Four months prior to Jason's death, I called for a full _x000D_
review and investigation from the Tomah VA._x000D_
    Two months prior to Jason's death I called for a full _x000D_
review and investigation from the U.S. Department of Veterans _x000D_
Affairs and the VA Office of Inspector General._x000D_
    On August 30, 2014, Jason tragically died at the Tomah VA _x000D_
as a result of what was medically deemed, mixed-drug toxicity._x000D_
    The Simcakoski family lost a son, a husband, a father, and _x000D_
we lost somebody who faithfully served his country._x000D_
    If there is one thing that I want to come out of this _x000D_
hearing and one thing that comes from this report, I want it to _x000D_
be this. I want everyone to hear the voice of Jason's wife _x000D_
Heather who said, and I quote, ``When I look back at the past, _x000D_
I want to know we made a difference. I want to believe we have _x000D_
leaders in our country who care. I want to inspire others to _x000D_
never give up because change is possible.''_x000D_
    Jason's family, just like veterans and their families in _x000D_
this community and communities across Wisconsin, are not _x000D_
interested in finger pointing and a blame game and neither am _x000D_
I. That is why over the past year I have focused on solutions _x000D_
to the problems at the VA. I have worked across party lines to _x000D_
advance reforms that will improve transparency, strengthen _x000D_
protections for whistleblowers, and to provide stronger _x000D_
oversight of VA prescribing practices._x000D_
    I authored a reform that was recently signed into law which _x000D_
requires the VA Inspector General to submit reports to Congress _x000D_
and make them available to the public. That is the standard _x000D_
that must now be met._x000D_
    Last year, I had the honor of working with Jason's family _x000D_
to develop legislation to provide the VA with the tools that it _x000D_
needs to prevent this type of tragedy from occurring to other _x000D_
veterans and their families._x000D_
    One year ago, I introduced this bipartisan legislation in _x000D_
Jason's name that earned the support of many veterans service _x000D_
organization. And, I am so proud, Senator Johnson, to have you _x000D_
join in this effort._x000D_
    I am pleased that the House of Representatives recently _x000D_
passed a version of Jason's bill and I am equally grateful to _x000D_
members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for their _x000D_
bipartisan support of Jason's bill, the Jason Simcakoski _x000D_
Memorial Opioid Safety Act. It is a critical reform and it _x000D_
continues to move forward. Families like Jason's have a story _x000D_
to tell, and it needs to be heard, and the movement of their _x000D_
legislation is strong evidence that their voice is being heard._x000D_
    My goal is to put these reforms in place to prevent Jason's _x000D_
tragedy from ever happening to another veteran or any of our _x000D_
veterans' families._x000D_
    Change is indeed possible. Heather's words inspire me and _x000D_
it is my hope that they will inspire all of us to work together _x000D_
and to prevent these problems and tragedies from ever happening _x000D_
again._x000D_
    I thank you, Senator Johnson, for providing me with this _x000D_
opportunity to join you today and I look forward to continuing _x000D_
our work together."
2924687,2924686,2924688,19236,1,"    Thank you, Senator Baldwin._x000D_
    Senator Carper, who is our Ranking Member of the Committee, _x000D_

like in the record without objection._x000D_

    It is the tradition of this Committee to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you will all four rise and raise your right _x000D_
hand?_x000D_
    Do you swear that the testimony that you will give before _x000D_
this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing _x000D_
but the truth, so help you, God?"
2924688,2924687,2924689,19236,1,    I do.
2924689,2924688,2924690,19236,1,    I do.
2924690,2924689,2924691,19236,1,"    Please be seated._x000D_
    Our first witness is Sloan Gibson. Mr. Gibson is the Deputy _x000D_
Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Deputy _x000D_
Secretary Gibson is accompanied by Dr. Gavin West, Senior _x000D_
Medical Advisor of Clinical Operations, Department of Veterans _x000D_

_x000D_
TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE SLOAN GIBSON,\1\ DEPUTY SECRETARY OF _x000D_
  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY DR."
2924691,2924690,2924692,19236,1,"    Let me begin by expressing my heartfelt _x000D_
sympathy to the Simcakoski family. I know that no words can _x000D_
ease the pain of your loss, but I would be remiss if I did not _x000D_
recognize the courage and the compassion and the deep devotion _x000D_
that you have displayed in all the work that you have done _x000D_
since Jason's death to make real difference in the lives of _x000D_
many other veterans._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Gibson appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 44._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Thank you and God bless you._x000D_
    I am accompanied today, as you mentioned by Dr. Gavin West. _x000D_
I wanted to point out, prior to his appointment to the _x000D_
responsibilities you have described, Dr. West served as the _x000D_
Chief of Primary Care and Associate Chief of Medicine, _x000D_
accountable for the delivery of evidence-based, high-quality, _x000D_
patient-centered care across VA. He continues to practice _x000D_
medicine at the Salt Lake City VA Healthcare System where he _x000D_
teaches medical students and treats veterans in primary care _x000D_
with a focus on pain management and substance abuse._x000D_
    He understands the issues and challenges we are facing at _x000D_
Tomah from years of traveling across the country working to _x000D_
optimize clinical care at many site visits to VA Medical _x000D_
Centers, including visits here at Tomah._x000D_
    Most importantly, perhaps, is that Dr. West served as the _x000D_
co-chair of VA's National Opioid Safety Program._x000D_
    Jason's death forced us to dive deeply into the Tomah _x000D_
system. What we found was an organization facing numerous _x000D_
challenges in dire need of change and new leadership._x000D_
    The problems at Tomah have been well documented. Failures _x000D_
related to the prescribing practices of controlled substances, _x000D_
examples of inadequate oversight appear, and failure related to _x000D_
culture._x000D_
    We own those challenges and problems, those failures. I own _x000D_
those problems, those failures._x000D_
    Avoidable harms to veterans are not acceptable. When they _x000D_
do occur, our obligation is to act with urgency to investigate _x000D_
and prevent a recurrence._x000D_
    At Tomah there was a clear and inexcusable lack of _x000D_
leadership that created and exacerbated these serious problems._x000D_
    The excellent frontline staff here at Tomah--that you have _x000D_
acknowledged in your comments, Mr. Chairman--working under new _x000D_
leadership, is fixing those problems._x000D_
    On October 5, we appointed Victoria Brahm as Acting _x000D_
Director. In her new role, Vicki did not wait to take action to _x000D_
improve veteran care. On November 27, she began executing _x000D_
Tomah's 100-Day Plan. For those of you that are unfamiliar with _x000D_
this concept, 100-Day Plans are a best practice of new leaders _x000D_
as they transition into their roles. They are not meant to fix _x000D_
everything, but to set a clear and bold direction while _x000D_
delivering near-term tangible results._x000D_
    The 100-Day Plan period ended in March, but the work _x000D_
continues to transform the way Tomah leaders operate, to change _x000D_
how Tomah treats their veteran patients, and to rebuild trust _x000D_
with veterans, employees, and the community._x000D_
    Thanks to this ambitious plan and the dedication of caring _x000D_
frontline staff, Tomah, once a symbol of the overuse of _x000D_
opioids, is actually on its way to becoming a model for change _x000D_
and best practices._x000D_
    Let me highlight some of the great work by Vicki and the _x000D_
staff._x000D_
    In April, Tomah completed more than 98 percent of their _x000D_
appointments with in 30 days. In fact, nearly 17,000 _x000D_
appointments were completed in April. Of all of those, 217 were _x000D_
over 30 days from the day that the veteran wished to be seen._x000D_
    Their wait times are consistently among the best in all of _x000D_
the VA._x000D_
    For primary care, less than 3 days. Specialty care, less _x000D_
than 6 days. And, for mental health, a little more than 2 days._x000D_
    Vicki and the team are working to restore trust among _x000D_
veterans. She is opening lines of communication with our _x000D_
veterans by opening her door, meeting with countless veterans _x000D_
these past months._x000D_
    Other continuing efforts include developing an academic _x000D_
detailing team to review the medical center's most complex _x000D_
chronic pain patients and provide additional recommendations _x000D_
for their care._x000D_
    To support this initiative, more than 30 primary care and _x000D_
mental health providers attended academic detailing educational _x000D_
sessions in the month of March._x000D_
    She is also creating a veteran pain school to assess and _x000D_
customize alternative pain management strategies for veterans. _x000D_
Importantly, Tomah has reduced the number of veterans receiving _x000D_
opioids by nearly one fourth._x000D_
    Tomah partners with the Wisconsin State Prescription Drug _x000D_
Monitoring Program, a program designed to ensure veterans are _x000D_
not obtaining opioid medications from multiple providers._x000D_
    Another step forward is the effective use of VA's audit _x000D_
tool, which allows doctors to improve practice and safety by _x000D_
seeing all the medications veterans are taking on a single _x000D_
dashboard._x000D_
    Vicki has made overdose education and Naloxone rescue kits _x000D_
available to patients at risk of accidental or intentional _x000D_
overdose. Naloxone has proven effective in reversing an opioid _x000D_
overdose. Simply put, she is finding options, alternatives, and _x000D_
solutions other than just a bag of pills._x000D_
    Let me tell you about one of Tomah's best practices. _x000D_
Evidence shows that the best outcomes in pain management occur _x000D_
with a comprehensive approach across multiple disciplines with _x000D_
the patient as the central focus. This empowers the veteran to _x000D_
be an active participant in decision making regarding pain care _x000D_
options._x000D_
    Tomah developed the integrated pain university, which is _x000D_
strongly based on patient education and empowerment. This whole _x000D_
health perspective identifies and addresses biological, _x000D_
psychological, and social aspects of pain management in _x000D_
conjunction with assessment by the Patient Aligned Care Team _x000D_
and any necessary specialty consults._x000D_
    Additionally, veterans receive information through a _x000D_
variety of elective classes taught by their respective health _x000D_
care professionals, which include pain medications, pain and _x000D_
nutrition, pain and sleep, aroma therapy, mindfulness, the _x000D_
neuroscience of pain, introduction to movement, staying _x000D_
motivated, and spirituality._x000D_
    The result of these and other efforts. As of the second _x000D_
quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2016, just over 9 percent of _x000D_
veterans at Tomah are prescribed some form of opioid._x000D_
    Across the entire country, across all of the VA's _x000D_
population, that national rate is nearly 13 percent._x000D_
    Vicki and the team are also listening. They are listening _x000D_
to veterans, to the community, and to employees. Listening led _x000D_
to the development of the Tomah VAMC Veterans Experience _x000D_
Council and Strategic Partnership Committee. The Veterans _x000D_
Experience Council will help make sure that Tomah leaders have _x000D_
a clear understanding of how veterans perceive VA, while the _x000D_
Strategic Partnership Committee will work to strengthen and _x000D_
promote a unified approach to veteran care throughout the _x000D_
community._x000D_
    Vicki has hosted more than 15 employee listening sessions _x000D_
covering all work shifts at the Medical Center. These listening _x000D_
sessions are critical in getting a sense of how staff can _x000D_
better serve veterans while using input from these sessions to _x000D_
improve employee engagement, making sure employees are _x000D_
satisfied with their work environment. Monthly staff meetings, _x000D_
quarterly nurse town hall, and roundings with local union _x000D_
officers are all part of the larger efforts of our commitment _x000D_
to employees._x000D_
    As a result of these and many other actions, we are seeing _x000D_
Tomah's performance improve, as measured both internally and by _x000D_
veterans themselves._x000D_
    By understanding the challenges and taking ownership in the _x000D_
problems, Vicki and the leadership team are improving the _x000D_
organizational culture and climate, providing more oversight, _x000D_
effective oversight, of care delivery, and addressing problems _x000D_
and prescribing practices._x000D_
    While there is more work to be done, this strategic _x000D_
direction has led to a real positive change._x000D_
    Vicki is modeling effective leadership by taking ownership _x000D_
and accepting accountability of past mistakes in order to make _x000D_
tangible progressin caring for our Nation's veterans._x000D_
    Bob McDonald and I talk a lot about sustainable _x000D_
accountability. Making sure employees understand our mission, _x000D_
values, and strategy. It has accountability that results in _x000D_
positive veteran outcomes, not just in the very near term, but _x000D_
over the long term as well._x000D_
    And I believe that is what we are seeing here at Tomah._x000D_
    Across all of the VA, our work to change prescribing _x000D_
practices and develop alternative approaches to pain management _x000D_
is delivering steady progress. We have also developed a _x000D_
predictive model and a clinical decisions support tool to _x000D_
identify patients being treated with opioids, who may be at _x000D_
risk of suicide-related events or overdose._x000D_
    This tool for opioid risk mitigation estimates the _x000D_
likelihood of an overdose or suicide event in the next year _x000D_
providing patient-tailored recommendations for risk mitigation _x000D_
and nonopioid pain management options._x000D_
    Lessons learned have caused a greater engagement and _x000D_
improves lives._x000D_
    We are also getting unwanted drugs out of veterans hands. _x000D_
Removal of veterans unwanted and unneeded medications reduces _x000D_
the risk of diversion, as well as intentional or unintentional _x000D_
overdose or poisonings._x000D_
    As of May 1, approximately 27,000 pounds of unwanted and _x000D_
unneeded medication have been collected and destroyed in an _x000D_
environmentally responsible manner._x000D_
    The overuse and misuse of opioids is a national problem, _x000D_
not just a VA problem. What we are doing here at Tomah and _x000D_
across the VA is part of a broader national effort to fight _x000D_
opioid addiction and overprescribing of powerful drugs._x000D_
    Our hope is that VA's efforts here and elsewhere will _x000D_
become part of the national approach that will benefit not just _x000D_
veterans, but all Americans._x000D_
    We still have work to do._x000D_
    With your support and the support of many others, we will _x000D_
succeed. The needs of veterans cannot be secondary to other _x000D_
agendas. It is unacceptable to VA leadership and should be _x000D_
unacceptable to anyone claiming to care about our Nation's _x000D_
veterans._x000D_
    I need your help to change the dialogue and a perception of _x000D_
this facility in order to get the right people interested in _x000D_
these jobs._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your Committee's support in _x000D_
identifying and resolving challenges here in Tomah. And, we _x000D_
look forward to your questions."
2924692,2924691,2924693,19236,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Gibson. Our next witness is _x000D_
Michael Missal. Mr. Missal is the Inspector General for the _x000D_
Department of Veterans Affairs._x000D_
    I had the privilege of going on the Senate floor and asking _x000D_
unanimous consent to have you confirmed. I know Senator Baldwin _x000D_

are glad we have one._x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHAEL J. MISSAL,\1\ INSPECTOR _x000D_
 GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY _x000D_
  DR."
2924693,2924692,2924694,19236,1,"    Thank you. Chairman Johnson, Senator Baldwin._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Missal appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 58._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Chairman Johnson, Senator Baldwin, Congressman Kind and _x000D_
Congressman Walz, thank you for the opportunity to appear today _x000D_
regarding the Office of Inspector General's past inspections of _x000D_
the Tomah VA Medical Center and our work in the area of pain _x000D_
management and opioid use._x000D_
    I am accompanied by Dr. John Daigh, Assistant Inspector _x000D_
General for Healthcare Inspections. He is a retired Army _x000D_
Colonel and has spent over 25 years providing healthcare to _x000D_
soldiers._x000D_
    First, on a personal note. I want to thank all veterans for _x000D_
their great and selfless service to our Nation._x000D_
    In addition, I want to express my sympathies to the _x000D_
families of those impacted by events at Tomah. All of us at the _x000D_
OIG need to take these experiences and use them to improve VA's _x000D_
operations._x000D_
    Finally, as the son of a World War II veteran, I had a _x000D_
strong reminder of our mission's importance when I had the _x000D_
great honor of attending the wreath laying ceremony at _x000D_
Arlington National Cemetery yesterday._x000D_
    On May 2, 2016, I was sworn in as the Inspector General. _x000D_
Since then, I have immersed myself to understand the people, _x000D_
work and goals of our office. I have been impressed with the _x000D_
OIG staff, many of whom are veterans, and their focus on _x000D_
bringing about positive changes in the integrity, efficiency _x000D_
and effectiveness of VA operations. While my integration has _x000D_
gone very well, I know there is much more to learn._x000D_
    I strongly advocate three overriding principals for our _x000D_
office. First, we must maintain our independence in all of our _x000D_
work, including avoiding the mere appearance of any undue _x000D_
outside influence. Second, we must be as transparent as _x000D_
possible, while safeguarding the privacy of veterans, _x000D_
whistleblowers, and others. Third, we must produce work of the _x000D_
highest quality, making sure it is accurate, timely, fair, _x000D_
objective and thorough._x000D_
    During my first month, I have spent significant time _x000D_
reviewing our healthcare inspections of Tomah. I have also met _x000D_
with the Homeland Security staff on two occasions to ensure _x000D_
they have the necessary information about our work as it _x000D_
pertains to Tomah._x000D_
    My written statement contains a timeline of events related _x000D_
to the Tomah Administrative Closure and I will not repeat it _x000D_
here. The inspection was administratively closed given the _x000D_
totality of the facts identified at that time._x000D_
    Specifically, that the allegations could not be _x000D_
substantiated, the impact that disclosure of unsubstantiated _x000D_
allegations could have on an individual's reputation and _x000D_
privacy, and knowing our forthcoming 2014 national report would _x000D_
highlight many deficiency in VA providers' compliance with _x000D_
opioid prescribing guidelines._x000D_
    I would like to comment on the White Paper about the Tomah _x000D_
inspection that was issued by my office on June 4, 2015. I do _x000D_
not agree with its tone or the gratuitous attacks on the _x000D_
reputation of individuals mentioned in it. It does not meet the _x000D_
high standards expected of our office._x000D_
    We have learned important lessons from this experience, _x000D_
including increasing the transparency of our work that should _x000D_
help us better meet our mission going forward._x000D_
    The changes made should increase the confidence that _x000D_
veterans, Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), Congress, and _x000D_
the public have in us._x000D_
    Subsequent to last year's hearing here, we released two _x000D_
additional inspections regarding Tomah. In June we issued a _x000D_
report with local and national recommendations focused on acute _x000D_
stroke treatment. And, in August we issued a report regarding _x000D_
the unexpected death of a patient during treatment at Tomah. _x000D_
This report had four recommendations._x000D_
    Notably we recommended that the facility ensure clinicians _x000D_
comply with VA policy regarding written informed consent when _x000D_
administering hazardous drugs._x000D_
    The issues associated with the use of opioids to treat _x000D_
chronic pain and other conditions are a serious concern, not _x000D_
just at Tomah, but throughout our Nation._x000D_
    We continue to focus on VA's opioid prescription practices, _x000D_
publishing two reports on the topics earlier this year. That _x000D_
work identified many of the same issues reported in our May _x000D_
2014, national review._x000D_
    We found VA was not following its own policies and _x000D_
procedures in six key areas, including follow-up evaluations of _x000D_
patients on take-home opioids, prescribing and dispensing of _x000D_
benzodiazepines concurrently with opioids, and routine and _x000D_
random urine drug tests prior to and during take-home opioid _x000D_
therapy._x000D_
    We note VA has taken actions to implement that report's _x000D_
recommendations, but they must monitor facility compliance with _x000D_
opioid prescription policies._x000D_
    Later this year we expect to publish a wide-ranging _x000D_
national review of VA's pain management services, substance use _x000D_
treatment programs, use of non-VA treatments, opioid _x000D_
prescribing practices, and access to State prescription drug _x000D_
monitoring programs._x000D_
    Yesterday our Nation paid tribute to the sacrifices of _x000D_
those who gave their lives in our defense. It is a valuable _x000D_
reminder for us at the OIG to rededicate ourselves to ensuring _x000D_
that our work is independent, accurate, timely, fair, objective _x000D_
and thorough._x000D_
    Dr. Daigh and I look forward to your questions."
2924694,2924693,2924695,19236,1,"    Thank you, Inspector General Missal._x000D_
    Mr. Gibson, let me start with you. When did the problems _x000D_
here at Tomah first hit your radar screen? When did you first _x000D_
hear about them? And, you have been in the VA how long?"
2924695,2924694,2924696,19236,1,"    I have been in VA for 2 years and 3 months--2 _x000D_
years and 4 months--right around there._x000D_
    I think I am going to go from broad recollection, because I _x000D_
did not go back to check the record. I am going to say probably _x000D_
sometime around January."
2924696,2924695,2924697,19236,1,"    Ok. When the news story broke, basically?"
2924697,2924696,2924698,19236,1,"    Yes, that is correct."
2924698,2924697,2924699,19236,1,"    So, in your experience with the VA, what _x000D_
was--during that time frame, what was the attitude of the VA? _x000D_
The main Department with the Office of Inspector General?"
2924699,2924698,2924700,19236,1,"    I would tell you, coming into the organization, _x000D_
I have always viewed, whether it is called an IG or some other _x000D_
entity, an auditor, that having a working relationship, a _x000D_
constructive relationship, albeit recognizing their _x000D_
independence, is vital, because, at the end of the day, we are _x000D_
after the same thing._x000D_
    I have worked to try to create that kind of relationship. I _x000D_
always find it amusing when folks suggest that the IG has been _x000D_
management's lap dog, because, if you go look, they issue over _x000D_
300 reports a year, which means we are getting wire-bushed _x000D_
about six times a week, every single week, and you scan the _x000D_
array of IG reports and you will find that there is no _x000D_
pandering to VA interest there. It is a very strong and _x000D_
independent entity."
2924700,2924699,2924701,19236,1,"    This Committee, does a lot of work with _x000D_
different Inspectors General. We see kind of a spectrum, quite _x000D_
honestly."
2924701,2924700,2924702,19236,1,    I am sure you do.
2924702,2924701,2924703,19236,1,"    As Ranking Member of a Subcommittee of _x000D_
this Committee, we uncovered the corruption within the Office _x000D_
of Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security and _x000D_
Charles Edwards basically moved on ahead of the posse, so have _x000D_
seen the lack of independence."
2924703,2924702,2924704,19236,1,    Yes.
2924704,2924703,2924705,19236,1,"    What I thought was quite shocking as we _x000D_
got involved in this situation, is that the Office of Inspector _x000D_
General had 140 reports on investigations and inspections that _x000D_
it buried, that it was covered up, it did not make public. Now, _x000D_
I have mentioned that to other Inspectors General and I asked _x000D_
them, how many reports have you not made public? And, they _x000D_
really look at me like I am from some other planet._x000D_
    I think I have had one Inspector General say, well, there _x000D_
was one we did not publish, because of concerns about national _x000D_
security._x000D_
    So, do you think it is appropriate that there are 140--now _x000D_
there is, by the way, another 70 percent reports on different _x000D_
wait time problems that apparently now the Office of Inspector _x000D_
General was starting to produce on a rolling basis, but that is _x000D_
a shocking number of reports on investigations and inspections _x000D_
from an independent transparent office that were not made _x000D_
public._x000D_
    What is your take on that?"
2924705,2924704,2924706,19236,1,"    Well, my take is that, in general, they should _x000D_
be made public. And, I think that is the stance that the IG has _x000D_
taken. There have been instances where this Office of Inspector _x000D_
General has identified things in the course of their _x000D_
investigation that were not related to what they were seeking _x000D_
to look into where they have come to me specifically to say, _x000D_
you need to know about this and where we have taken appropriate _x000D_
actions in the wake of that._x000D_
    That is the kind, I think, frankly, part of what you see _x000D_
here, and I was not here 4 years ago, so I cannot talk _x000D_
knowledgeably about what was or was not the environment and the _x000D_
practice. But I will tell you, over my two plus years here, _x000D_
that the IG has been willing to bring things to me, and I think _x000D_
it is a much more principled base view. I think some of this, _x000D_
we get wrapped up in the rules, and we get so wrapped up in the _x000D_
rules, we lose sight of the principles._x000D_
    And so, here is a case where I think, quite frankly, this _x000D_
is my view from the outside looking in, where we got focused on _x000D_
the rules. And, the rules basically said, this is what we are _x000D_
here to investigate, and we did step back and look more broadly _x000D_
at principles and I think the IG has demonstrated the _x000D_
willingness and the ability to do that in subsequent events. I _x000D_
do not know whether they learned from this particular instance _x000D_
or from other, but I think that is what we owe veterans._x000D_
    And, I am going to go back and say that, ahead of anything _x000D_
else, this is a leadership failure. There is lots of finger _x000D_
pointing and everything else. At the end of the day, we own _x000D_
this. VA leadership owns this. We had ample opportunity over a _x000D_
period of years to fix this. That was the leadership's _x000D_
responsibility._x000D_
    And, we failed to get it done."
2924706,2924705,2924707,19236,1,"    I appreciate that. Dr. Daigh, you were _x000D_
part of the inspection team for Tomah, correct?"
2924707,2924706,2924708,19236,1,"    One of the things that come across in our _x000D_
report is the confusion over what is the standard for _x000D_
substantiating a claim? For example, in so many instances, this _x000D_
was not a he said/she said, which, again, I have been in _x000D_
business. I have had these employees situations where it is _x000D_
kind of difficult when it is he said/she said. This is a case _x000D_
with Dr. Houlihan where it was he said/they said. I mean, there _x000D_
was so much corroboration of the allegations._x000D_
    How did you come to the conclusion that so many of these _x000D_
charges were unsubstantiated? What is the standard?"
2924708,2924707,2924709,19236,1,"    Let us talk about, why we do not talk _x000D_
about the allegations of a climate of fear, a culture of fear _x000D_
within the--I mean, there was so many reports and it was so _x000D_
obvious that Dr. Houlihan, according to testimony, was a bully _x000D_
and created that and retaliated, and there were people fired as _x000D_
a result. And, Chris Kirkpatrick committed suicide after he was _x000D_
fired. I mean, there was so much accumulated evidence, how _x000D_
could that not be substantiated?"
2924709,2924708,2924710,19236,1,"    I mean, most people reading our report _x000D_
will say there is a lot of substantiated evidence to support _x000D_
that charge._x000D_
    Just quick before I turn over to Senator Baldwin._x000D_
    On page 270, we have your signature on the Administrative _x000D_
Closure sheet. Every ounce of evidence that we can find shows _x000D_
that Administrative Closure occurred in August of 2014. I want _x000D_
everybody to take a look at page 270. It completely looks like _x000D_
this has been doctored from 8-12-14 to 3-12-14."
2924710,2924709,2924711,19236,1,"    So what, what further evidence, other than _x000D_
this, what appears to be a doctored----_x000D_
    Voice. Liar._x000D_
would indicate that you closed this out in March versus August?"
2924711,2924710,2924712,19236,1,"    Is that normally how you write a three? _x000D_
With an eight kind of embodied within the three?"
2924712,2924711,2924713,19236,1,"    Is there any further evidence that this _x000D_
was actually administratively closed in March of 2014, because _x000D_
everything else shows that you administratively closed this in _x000D_
August?"
2924713,2924712,2924714,19236,1,"    I find this unbelievably puzzling and I do _x000D_
want to get to the bottom of this. Senator Baldwin."
2924714,2924713,2924715,19236,1,"    Thank you. So, I want to kind of start _x000D_
where Senator Johnson left off with regard to this process on _x000D_
this Administrative Closure._x000D_
    The report, Committee report outlines a very long _x000D_
inspection, investigation. You used the words somewhat _x000D_
interchangeably._x000D_
    Now, the work product after the inspection, the visits, the _x000D_
interviews, etc., seems to have gone through a number of _x000D_
iterations prior to there being a decision to make this an _x000D_
Administrative Closure. I know that, and you will see this _x000D_
throughout the Committee report, frustrations expressed about _x000D_
documents that were requested from the Inspector General, but _x000D_
were not granted to the Committee._x000D_
    But we had an opportunity granted by the IG's office in the _x000D_
_x000D_
last couple of weeks to inspect the draft reports. Could not _x000D_
take notes--and I did not do it, but my staff went in to see _x000D_
them, and so the Committee has reviewed some of the drafts _x000D_
prepared during the Tomah investigation, and I was disturbed to _x000D_
learn, after I was briefed, that things that the IG staff was _x000D_
aware of did not make it into the final Administrative Closure._x000D_
    For example, one case study referenced in an IG draft _x000D_
report explained that Dr. Houlihan had increased one patient's _x000D_
dosage of oxycodone more than eight fold in one year. And, that _x000D_
there was not always a rationale noted in the chart. During the _x000D_
same time frame, this patient had nine refills of a Schedule II _x000D_
controlled substance dispensed more than a week early._x000D_
    Probably more disturbing, the case study explained, and I _x000D_
am paraphrasing, because there were not copies available, that _x000D_
Dr. Houlihan miscalculated the number of pills prescribed to _x000D_
the patient and that Dr. Houlihan made up for the shortage by _x000D_
refilling the prescription early._x000D_
    Can you explain to me why details of these case studies _x000D_
referenced in the draft report did not make it into the final _x000D_
Administrative Closure?"
2924715,2924714,2924716,19236,1,"    Well, I mean, on that Administrative _x000D_
Closure, you did note that patients requested early refills, _x000D_
but the document does not state that Dr. Houlihan wrote in _x000D_
files that he miscalculated the prescriptions and made up for _x000D_
the shortages by refilling the prescriptions. And, to me, this _x000D_
tells a different story. There is also no mention that he did _x000D_
not always provide a rationale in the charts for substantially _x000D_
increasing already high prescriptions like the example I just _x000D_
mentioned._x000D_
    So we gathered, in March of 2015, this, the Senate Homeland _x000D_
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and you testified. _x000D_
You testified that staff at Tomah were at the outer boundary of _x000D_
acceptable prescribing practices. And, this statement seems to _x000D_
imply to me that there may have been some unusual practices _x000D_
happening at the Tomah facility and within the facility's _x000D_
leadership._x000D_
    So, is the example I just raised the type of thing that was _x000D_
on the outer boundary of acceptable prescribing practices or is _x000D_
it beyond that boundary."
2924716,2924715,2924717,19236,1,"    Inspector General Missal, I know you are _x000D_
new to this position, but you have read this Committee report, _x000D_
and I guess I want to know your opinion on putting out a policy _x000D_
that outlines what the standard ought to be in your Agency for _x000D_
substantiating or unsubstantiating allegations, at least for _x000D_
cases like this where you think it might be a close call or _x000D_
right outside those boundaries?"
2924717,2924716,2924718,19236,1,"    Yes. I have looked at that. I have had the _x000D_
opportunity to review the report. Standard of care is a _x000D_
complicated issue. For instance, when we are doing an _x000D_
investigation, we look to see if somebody did something wrong. _x000D_
The standard to me is preponderance of the evidence. Is it more _x000D_
likely than not that somebody did it?_x000D_
    With respect to healthcare inspections, you are looking at _x000D_
the quality of care, which is a far more complicated area. And, _x000D_
it really depends on a variety of things of what you are _x000D_
looking at. For example, what the literature says, what experts _x000D_
may say, etc., but I understand the point. I know it was a _x000D_
significant issue and we intend to look very closely at that _x000D_
and to talk about standard of care and the standards that we _x000D_
are going to be using going forward, so we will be doing that."
2924718,2924717,2924719,19236,1,"    Well, with the advantage of hindsight, _x000D_
this does not look all that complicated to me."
2924719,2924718,2924720,19236,1,    We are going to look at that very closely.
2924720,2924719,2924721,19236,1,"    Thank you, Senator Baldwin._x000D_
    What is amazing is they had a pretty high standard for, _x000D_
substantiating a claim in their OIG report, but yet in the _x000D_
White Paper, they had no problem rushing out a report that _x000D_
literally threw the whistleblowers and these individuals under _x000D_
the bus. It is really quite remarkable._x000D_
    I also appreciate the fact that you were talking about the _x000D_
frustration this Committee has had in obtaining the _x000D_
information. I just want to refer everybody to page 324. This _x000D_
is what one of the documents looks like provided by the Office _x000D_
of Inspector General, who has not yet complied with our full _x000D_
subpoena. I mean, think about that. This Committee had to _x000D_
subpoena the Office of Inspector General to get the _x000D_
information. And now, 16 months later, well, it is really about _x000D_
a year later, because we issued the subpoena at the end of _x000D_
April, still has not been complied with, so, Mr. Missal, again, _x000D_
we look forward to working with you on that._x000D_
    I do want to welcome Representative Kind and Representative _x000D_
Walz from Minnesota, and we will not hold that against you. _x000D_
Congressman Kind."
2924721,2924720,2924722,19236,1,    Sure.
2924722,2924721,2924723,19236,1,"    Yes, I think it will help, but hopefully we do _x000D_
not need legislation to become more transparent._x000D_
    My goal is to communicate better with the public, with _x000D_
Congress and with the Department on issues. There were a number _x000D_
of mistakes made by my office at the time and we agree that one _x000D_
of the mistakes was not keeping Congress better informed on _x000D_
this issue. And, I am going to work very hard to make sure that _x000D_
does not happen again."
2924723,2924722,2924724,19236,1,    Yes.
2924724,2924723,2924725,19236,1,"    I appreciate the request, and I appreciate your _x000D_
recognizing the good work that goes on every day. Because, you _x000D_
are right, it does not get reported. It does not diminish the _x000D_
challenges that we have, but it is part of the context. The _x000D_
short answer is yes. And, we have been working, really, with _x000D_
both of our authorizing committees on an array of legislative _x000D_
priorities that we have, many of which get at some of these _x000D_
very issues. I am thinking most immediately of the request to _x000D_
make all of our Medical Center Directors and Network Directors _x000D_
Title 38._x000D_
    Quite frankly, if I had that authority in my hip pocket _x000D_
right now, the lady sitting behind me would already be the _x000D_
Medical Center Director here. But I am probably going to get in _x000D_
trouble for committing a prohibited personnel practice for _x000D_
having said that, but, she is doing awesome work and she is the _x000D_
kind of person--and having the kind of ability to, to direct _x000D_
hire and a little flexibility around compensation would make _x000D_
that possible, among a large number of other priorities that _x000D_
you have identified. Thank you for asking, sir."
2924725,2924724,2924726,19236,1,    Congressman Walz.
2924726,2924725,2924727,19236,1,"    I think some of the activities that I described _x000D_
earlier, Vicki has been engaging in; the open door with _x000D_
veterans, the outreach into the community, and looking for ways _x000D_
where we bring the community together to help support our _x000D_
veterans._x000D_
    And, one of the things that we started doing recently, _x000D_
because access is such a critical issue for us, is we started, _x000D_
at our kiosks, asking the one very simple question, how _x000D_
satisfied were you that you got today's appointment when you _x000D_
wanted it. At Tomah the answer is 93 percent satisfied or _x000D_
completely satisfied._x000D_
    They are doing so many things so well. You can look at the _x000D_
sale data._x000D_
    Many of you may not realize VA leads the country, perhaps _x000D_
the world, in reducing healthcare associated infections. _x000D_
Healthcare associated infections--second leading cause of death _x000D_
in _x000D_
America--more than automobile accidents and breast cancer _x000D_
combined._x000D_
    And when, and external studies, when looked, who was, who _x000D_
was doing this better than any other organization? It was not _x000D_
the Cleveland Clinic. It was not Kaiser Permanente. It was not _x000D_
Geisinger. It was VA."
2924727,2924726,2924728,19236,1,"    Guess who? Guess who leads VA? Tomah, in _x000D_
minimizing healthcare associated infections._x000D_
    I will tell you, the number one area where they have work _x000D_
to do is in employee satisfaction and employee engagement. And, _x000D_
that is the culture problem. And, that is why leadership _x000D_
matters so much._x000D_
    So, veterans are telling us, you are hearing from veterans _x000D_
that are saying--I have heard from veterans here. And, I will _x000D_
tell you, my classmate was a patient here in the Community _x000D_
Living Center (CLC) for 23 years. And, the family in his _x000D_
obituary said the staff here made them feel like they were part _x000D_
of their family._x000D_
    That is what is happening with so many of the Wisconsinites _x000D_
that are working right here, caring for our veterans, are they _x000D_
doing the right thing, but we did not have the right leadership _x000D_
in place. And, I think, I think we have a good clue----"
2924728,2924727,2924729,19236,1,"    Yes, we do."
2924729,2924728,2924730,19236,1,    Yes.
2924730,2924729,2924731,19236,1,    You got it.
2924731,2924730,2924732,19236,1,    You got it.
2924732,2924731,2924733,19236,1,"    Thank you, Congressman Walz._x000D_
    Let me continue on that vein about accountability._x000D_
    In 2015 I introduced the Ensuring Veterans Safety Through _x000D_
Accountability Act and I testified with Senator Baldwin when _x000D_
she introduced the Jason Simcakoski--I always forget the full _x000D_
name."
2924733,2924732,2924734,19236,1,    Opioid Safety Act.
2924734,2924733,2924735,19236,1,"    Opioid Safety Act at the Veterans' Affairs _x000D_
Committee. I was more than disappointed when the _x000D_
representatives from the VA testified against the _x000D_
Accountability Act._x000D_
    Now, fortunately, a similar provision introduced by Marco _x000D_
Rubio, which I cosponsored, was passed by the VA Committee, but _x000D_
having been in business for 30 some years, I mean, I understand _x000D_
that probably the most corrosive thing to any organization is _x000D_
not being able to hold the bad actors accountable. And, yet _x000D_
here you have the representatives of VA saying, nah, we do not _x000D_
want that authority to hold people accountable._x000D_
    I mean, that is at the heart. I agree with you. I think all _x000D_
of us here agree. As we tour around and talk to the doctors and _x000D_
nurses, and as I said in my opening statement, they do an _x000D_
extraordinary job. They are really concerned, but unless we _x000D_
really have the ability to hold people accountable, that is _x000D_
what causes these types of tragedies, so is that something that _x000D_
the VA will now embrace? The ability to actually discipline and _x000D_
terminate and hold people accountable through the VA system."
2924735,2924734,2924736,19236,1,    I would say the answer is an unequivocal yes.
2924736,2924735,2924737,19236,1,    Good. We will move on.
2924737,2924736,2924738,19236,1,"    Well, that has been part of my own personal _x000D_
obligation as a leader since I first got to VA. I am the guy _x000D_
that takes action on senior leaders in the department. I am the _x000D_
guy that issued the removal on DeSanctis. And, I am the guy _x000D_
that looks at other instances of particular notoriety to ensure _x000D_
that we are taking the appropriate action."
2924738,2924737,2924739,19236,1,"    Good. But we want to give you that _x000D_
authority, because you have to have it._x000D_
    Another piece of legislation I introduced was the Dr. Chris _x000D_
Kirkpatrick--let me give you the full title of that one as _x000D_
well: The Christopher Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act. _x000D_
And, this was really prompted by a Committee hearing we had _x000D_
where Sean Kirkpatrick testified before our Committee, and one _x000D_
thing that I have been literally shocked by, again, coming from _x000D_
the private sector, even though we have all these whistleblower _x000D_
protection laws on the books for a hundred years, the level of _x000D_
retaliation against those people that have the courage to come _x000D_
forward, like Dr. Noelle Johnson, like Ryan Honl, like Chris _x000D_
Kirkpatrick, is jaw dropping._x000D_
    So, again, I hope that the VA will embrace and help support _x000D_
the passage of that piece of legislation to give those _x000D_
whistleblowers the protection they really need._x000D_
    And, by the way, I would announce again that my _x000D_
Committee has set up the whistleblower hotline. It is just _x000D_
And, I think it is also an important step that is required, so _x000D_
that whistleblowers within the VA--and, by the way, the highest _x000D_
level of retaliation, according to the Office of Special _x000D_
Counsel (OSC), is within the Veterans Administration, which is _x000D_
a real problem._x000D_
    So, again, will you support the Christopher Kirkpatrick _x000D_
Whistleblower Protection Act?"
2924739,2924738,2924740,19236,1,"    I do not know what is in the Act and I also do _x000D_
not know what is in the Accountability legislation you referred _x000D_
to earlier._x000D_
    But what I will tell you is that I personally, as the _x000D_
Acting Secretary, met with Carolyn Lerner, the Special Counsel _x000D_
of the United States. I committed to VA becoming certified, the _x000D_
first large Federal department that became certified as a _x000D_
whistleblower protecting organization. I have publicly _x000D_
recognized and, and presented awards to whistleblowers. I meet _x000D_
with whistleblowers in every location where I go visit. When I _x000D_
came to this location last year, I met with Ryan Honl. I do _x000D_
that. Coming out of the private sector, I understand that your _x000D_
most valuable source of information on how to do things better _x000D_
are your frontline employees._x000D_
    The last thing you want are people that are afraid to raise _x000D_
their hand, so everything we are doing as an organization has _x000D_
to do with creating that kind of culture._x000D_
    A little bit along the lines of what Mike said earlier, I _x000D_
do not need a law to tell me to do that. That is back to just _x000D_
good leadership. Not necessarily from me, but from people _x000D_
across the Department."
2924740,2924739,2924741,19236,1,"    I appreciate that._x000D_
    Dr. Daigh, as I am going through the Committee's report. _x000D_
And, you see that the first hotline notice, really, is about _x000D_
March 2011. And, for whatever reason, it did not rise to the _x000D_
level. And, then in August 2011, partly because of _x000D_
Representative Kind's inquiry, it all of a sudden became a _x000D_
Congressional hotline or Congressional inquiry, gained a little _x000D_
steam and got the notice, but it took until 2014 to complete _x000D_
this inspection, investigation, and then issue some kind of _x000D_
report._x000D_
    There is an awful lot of activity and I think the first _x000D_
site visit was in 2012, and not a whole lot happened in 2013 _x000D_
into whatever date it actually was closed. What was happening _x000D_
during that point in time?"
2924741,2924740,2924742,19236,1,"    OK, good. Great. I appreciate that."
2924742,2924741,2924743,19236,1,"    And, I appreciate that, and yes, the VA, _x000D_
when they undertook their own investigation, together with this _x000D_
Committee, in just a couple of months pretty well substantiated _x000D_
the charge and started holding people accountable, so."
2924743,2924742,2924744,19236,1,"    I would argue that the responsibility of _x000D_
the Inspector General is to make that information public and _x000D_
also make sure that something is done about it. And, that did _x000D_
not happen._x000D_
    I am out of time here. Senator Baldwin."
2924744,2924743,2924745,19236,1,"    On the issue of accountability, I have a _x000D_
questions for you, Mr. Gibson._x000D_
    Dr. Houlihan was fired from the VA. And, at the time that _x000D_
he was fired, I wrote to the VA to ensure that veterans would _x000D_
not ultimately be referred to his practice outside the VA _x000D_
through the Veterans Choice Program._x000D_
    Subsequently, through public reports, his license was _x000D_
suspended by the State of Wisconsin. And, I received a letter _x000D_
back from the VA indicating that he would not be eligible to _x000D_
serve veterans under the Choice Program because his license was _x000D_
suspended._x000D_
    You may or may not be aware, again, through public _x000D_
reporting it appears that an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) has _x000D_
reinstated his license during the pendency of proceedings _x000D_
before this State._x000D_
    And so, I want to, first of all, get assurances from you _x000D_
that in light of that new development, that Dr. Houlihan would _x000D_
not be getting referrals of veterans through the Veterans _x000D_
Choice Program."
2924745,2924744,2924746,19236,1,    Absolutely not.
2924746,2924745,2924747,19236,1,    And----
2924747,2924746,2924748,19236,1,"    Senator Baldwin, if I can briefly _x000D_
interrupt. That is an incredibly important point you are _x000D_
making. That Administrative Law Judge is citing the White _x000D_
Paper, so Inspector General Missal, would you repudiate that so _x000D_
that that can no longer be used by the Administrative Law _x000D_
Judge? That White Paper?"
2924748,2924747,2924749,19236,1,"    Yes. My office took the White Paper off its _x000D_
website, so to me that means it no longer is a document of the _x000D_
Inspector General's Office."
2924749,2924748,2924750,19236,1,    Thank you. Senator Baldwin.
2924750,2924749,2924751,19236,1,"    So, this correspondence between me and the _x000D_
VA has highlighted for me that nothing in the VA Choice _x000D_
legislation explicitly requires that somebody who is fired or _x000D_
suspended from the VA for cause related to their service, to _x000D_
our nation's veterans, there is nothing that explicitly _x000D_
addresses this in the law. And so, I feel like this is a _x000D_
dangerous loophole that we currently have._x000D_
    I have recently introduced bipartisan legislation that just _x000D_
passed the Senate, although it has not made it all the way _x000D_
through the legislative process. That legislation requires the _x000D_
VA Secretary to block the healthcare provider from _x000D_
participating in community programs if that provider was fired _x000D_
or suspended from the VA, violated his or her medical license, _x000D_
had a Department certification revoked, or otherwise broke the _x000D_
law._x000D_
    Secretary Gibson, are there steps that the VA can take _x000D_
right now to ensure that this loophole is not being exploited _x000D_
to taken advantage of by other providers other than the case _x000D_
that we are talking about today?"
2924751,2924750,2924752,19236,1,"    I have not discussed the matters specifically _x000D_
with the folks that are working here in the community, but I _x000D_
will do so. There is no reason why we cannot implement a policy _x000D_
that accomplishes the same thing without the need for _x000D_
legislation."
2924752,2924751,2924753,19236,1,"    During our Chairman's opening statement, _x000D_
he drew our attention to portions of the Committee report _x000D_
discussing the concern that two of the witnesses during the _x000D_
inspection were impaired, possibly by drugs or alcohol. It was _x000D_
a suspicion. There is a lot of discussion in the Committee _x000D_
report on this._x000D_
    I think disturbing was that the only two follow-up actions _x000D_
were a doctor emailed the VA OIG's General Counsel wanted to _x000D_
discuss a concern regarding possibly an impaired interviewee, _x000D_
or interviewees, and subsequently, and off-the-record _x000D_
discussion with the Tomah VA's Director at the time, Mario _x000D_
DeSanctis._x000D_
    There is no clear record of whether that tip was followed _x000D_
up on or not._x000D_
    My question is, will the VA Office of Inspector General _x000D_
adopt new policies or procedures so that if this happen in a _x000D_
future case, and, of course, we hope it never does, that the IG _x000D_
suspects that a witness employed by the VA is under the _x000D_
influence of a controlled substance that there is a procedure _x000D_
that will be followed that would provide greater accountability _x000D_
and safety for our Nation's veterans?_x000D_
    I would like to hear both of you on that, but, this was _x000D_
first noticed by the team doing the inspection, and so, I want _x000D_
to hear what the Inspector General has to say about procedures _x000D_
if this should ever happen again. And, then I would like to _x000D_
hear from you, Deputy Secretary Gibson."
2924753,2924752,2924754,19236,1,"    I would love to share my two cents worth, yes, _x000D_
ma'am."
2924754,2924753,2924755,19236,1,"    With respect to my view on that, if I ever see _x000D_
a situation where I think somebody, particularly somebody _x000D_
providing healthcare to veterans, may be in a situation where _x000D_
they are impaired in one way, I would immediately make sure _x000D_
appropriate people within VHA or above that were aware of that _x000D_
and to follow up and to make sure that that situation was _x000D_
resolved to our satisfaction as quickly as possible."
2924755,2924754,2924756,19236,1,"    And, in this particular case, do you have _x000D_
any knowledge that the Committee does not about whether _x000D_
anything was followed up on by Director DeSanctis?"
2924756,2924755,2924757,19236,1,    I do not have any more information.
2924757,2924756,2924758,19236,1,"    I am going to tell you, based upon the first _x000D_
time I ever heard of this was reading it in the report. First _x000D_
time ever. We are right back to leadership. That is what this _x000D_
is about. This is about delivering safe care to veterans. And, _x000D_
the failure of leadership that happened here was the failure on _x000D_
the part of the Medical Center Director to take appropriate _x000D_
action._x000D_
    And, everything that I mentioned earlier, I issued the _x000D_
removal on the Medical Center Director. I reviewed hundreds and _x000D_
hundreds of pages of evidence. And, I will tell you, not doing _x000D_
something about this would be very consistent with the pattern _x000D_
of behavior that I saw there. It was a failure of leadership. _x000D_
It should not have happened. Period._x000D_
    The principles here, you said, put the veteran at the _x000D_
center of everything that you are doing, and that is exactly _x000D_
what we are trying to do. And, understanding--making leadership _x000D_
in the organization understand the sense of urgency with which _x000D_
they must act when something has been presented to them that _x000D_
suggests, that the safety of the veteran, the care of the _x000D_
veteran, may be at risk, that is an urgent situation. You have _x000D_
to act and you have to act timely and promptly. That is what _x000D_
these folks have been doing._x000D_
    There was an instance that happened--these folks, and I am _x000D_
not going to--I will not get into the great details, but here _x000D_
is the timeline. They became aware on November 19, 2015, that _x000D_
there was misconduct. They launched a Fact Finding the next _x000D_
day, November 20, 2015. The Fact Finding was completed on _x000D_
December 7 and the proposed removal was issued on December 8. _x000D_
That is the kind of timely action and follow-up. That is what _x000D_
good leaders do. And, that is what we have to ensure we have in _x000D_
place all across this Department."
2924758,2924757,2924759,19236,1,    I could not agree more.
2924759,2924758,2924760,19236,1,"    We do not need a watchdog to tell us how to do _x000D_
our job. Important to have a good watchdog, but we do not need _x000D_
one to tell us how to do our job."
2924760,2924759,2924761,19236,1,    Congressman Kind.
2924761,2924760,2924762,19236,1,"    Yes._x000D_
that made it almost impossible for someone with a dissenting _x000D_
view or dissenting opinion to come forward in order to change a _x000D_
certain treatment regimen."
2924762,2924761,2924763,19236,1,    Yes.
2924763,2924762,2924764,19236,1,"    I know it has been fixed here in Tomah. I think _x000D_
the issues that has been raised here prompts a review across _x000D_
our organization to ensure that we have appropriate separation _x000D_
of authority here._x000D_
    Very early on, in fact, at the very beginning of the _x000D_
Medical Center Director's tenure, the issue of separating the _x000D_
reporting relationship for pharmacy was raised. The Medical _x000D_
Center Director refused to do that, until, I am going to say, _x000D_
roughly a year and a half later, when he finally got a new _x000D_
Associate Director in place. We had problems in construction _x000D_
with VA and, and the Executive Director responsible for that _x000D_
area was encouraged to leave, and he did leave._x000D_
    I accepted direct responsibility for construction and _x000D_
facilities management until such time as we got the leadership _x000D_
in place. That is precisely the kind of action that should have _x000D_
been taken here."
2924764,2924763,2924765,19236,1,    Yes.
2924765,2924764,2924766,19236,1,"    The day you and I were here in Tomah, last _x000D_
year, together, was the day that Houlihan was placed on _x000D_
administrative leave."
2924766,2924765,2924767,19236,1,"    He had been removed from clinical duties, but _x000D_
it became evident to me that he was still exerting undue _x000D_
influence on other providers in the organization. That was the _x000D_
day he was removed."
2924767,2924766,2924768,19236,1,"    I do. We work very closely and very _x000D_
collaboratively with the Office of Special Counsel. I would say _x000D_
to my brethren next to me here that there is probably an _x000D_
opportunity for the Office of Special Counsel and our IG to _x000D_
work more collaboratively together. Sometimes things have _x000D_
gotten in the way of that. But between our investigation _x000D_
resources, their investigative resources, and the Office of _x000D_
Special Counsel's investigative resources, I think there was an _x000D_
opportunity for us to do better by taxpayers and better by _x000D_
veterans both."
2924768,2924767,2924769,19236,1,"    Yes._x000D_
I know the VA here in Tomah are also exploring more _x000D_
alternatives and complimentary forms of medical treatment----"
2924769,2924768,2924770,19236,1,"    Yes._x000D_
cocktail of prescription drugs and expecting that to solve all _x000D_
the problems, but there is also a danger of overreacting. And, _x000D_
I have some feedback from veterans that it is a little more _x000D_
difficult for them to get the prescription meds, the opioids _x000D_
that they need for proper pain management. I know it is a _x000D_
difficult balance, but how well are we doing on that front."
2924770,2924769,2924771,19236,1,    Dr. West.
2924771,2924770,2924772,19236,1,"    One of the things that we have been doing under _x000D_
Leaders Developing Leaders, the Secretary and I have personally _x000D_
met with the 600 top leaders of the entire Department, and one _x000D_
of the messages that we deliver is the message that you just _x000D_
spoke. It is the importance of getting news, whether it be good _x000D_
news or bad news. This is a 180 degree change for this _x000D_
organization. First of all, folks--they were not talking to _x000D_
members of Congress or to the media under any circumstance. _x000D_
What we are trying to do is to get them to talk, both when _x000D_
there is good news or when there is bad news, let us get it out _x000D_
on the table, own the problem, start tackling it, and get it _x000D_
fixed. I mean, that is how you earn trust back."
2924772,2924771,2924773,19236,1,"    Yes, sir."
2924773,2924772,2924774,19236,1,    Congressman Walz.
2924774,2924773,2924775,19236,1,"    I think first of all, the Title 38 provision _x000D_
around senior executives is precisely the right place to go to _x000D_
give us both the authority that we need on hiring as well as _x000D_
the authority that we need from a disciplinary standpoint._x000D_
    I freely admit there are instances where I start wading _x000D_
into a particular case, and I ask out loud, who is the advocate _x000D_
for the veteran in all of this, because there are lots of _x000D_
advocates for the employee. Who is the advocate for the _x000D_
veteran? And, I step up and fill that particular void._x000D_
    We have to ensure that we are restoring balance there and I _x000D_
would tell you, one of the most powerful things that any member _x000D_
can do--we all know that there are a lot of good thing going on _x000D_
at VA. We all know that. And, when there are opportunities to--_x000D_
I am not saying, ``do not talk about the bad things,'' because _x000D_
there are bad things that we have to do, as well, Just tell the _x000D_
whole picture. Yes, we have to fix this. We have to fix this, _x000D_
but did you know they are doing this? They are doing this?_x000D_
    Because the real tragedy comes when veterans who need to _x000D_
come to VA for help or for care do not, because of what they _x000D_
have been reading in the media and they stay away. That is the _x000D_
tragedy. You look at some of the suicide numbers and the _x000D_
statistics, and I think we are close to coming out with some _x000D_
refined statistics there, but, what we have seen consistently _x000D_
when we have looked, is that the preponderant number of _x000D_
suicides that veterans commit, each day are veterans that are _x000D_
not in the VA Healthcare System._x000D_
    And, you look at--the old number has been 17 of the 22 are _x000D_
veterans that are not receiving care at VA. We want those _x000D_
veterans into the VA Healthcare System if there is any way, _x000D_
shape or form for us to get them._x000D_
    There were things that we do--Gavin and I have been having _x000D_
this conversation because of some of the transformational work _x000D_
that he is doing. If we sat here and spent 30 minutes and _x000D_
talked about all of the things that VA does around mental _x000D_
healthcare, you would not realize. There is no healthcare _x000D_
organization in America, perhaps even in the world, that does _x000D_
the things, that has the capability that VA has. 550,000 _x000D_
completed mental health outpatient appointments every single _x000D_
month. I mean, all of the ancillary support services that we _x000D_
alluded to earlier."
2924775,2924774,2924776,19236,1,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
I could, Senator Johnson, just end with this, that we as a _x000D_
Nation need to not talk about those 22. We do not need to set _x000D_
expectations that this is an outcome that is going to happen. _x000D_
We have to talk about names and individuals, so when we are _x000D_
talking about the mistake here, it is Jason and his family."
2924776,2924775,2924777,19236,1,    Yes.
2924777,2924776,2924778,19236,1,    Yes.
2924778,2924777,2924779,19236,1,"    Yes._x000D_
    Voice. Thank you, sir."
2924779,2924778,2924780,19236,1,"    Thank you, Congressman Walz._x000D_
    I want to be respectful of everybody's time here. Another _x000D_
round of questions would definitely eat into that time, so I _x000D_
certainly encourage the Members of the Committee here and the _x000D_
Congressmen to certainly submit their questions for the record. _x000D_
I am sure we all have additional questions._x000D_
    I want to thank our witnesses, but I particularly want to _x000D_
thank the families that have suffered this tragedy and the _x000D_
whistleblowers for coming forward and having the courage to _x000D_
make this public. I know it is not all that easy, but this is _x000D_
what transparency is all about. It is what really does produce _x000D_
the kind of accountability that, and justice that really is _x000D_
deserved here._x000D_
    So, with that--I know I have the magic words here _x000D_
somewhere. I have them._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 15 days until June _x000D_
15, at 5:00 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions _x000D_
for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2924780,2924779,2924781,19237,1,"    This hearing of the Senate Committee on _x000D_
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will come to order. _x000D_
I want to welcome everybody here._x000D_
    Before we begin, I would like to ask everyone to rise as we _x000D_
welcome the UW-Stevens Point Army ROTC Color Guard to post the _x000D_
colors._x000D_
    Member of UW-Stevens Point Army ROTC Color Guard. Center _x000D_
face. Post colors. Present arms. Order arms. Center face. _x000D_
Forward march."
2924781,2924780,2924782,19237,1,    Please be seated.
2924782,2924781,2924783,19237,1,"    I would like to thank Cadet Jordan Stuart, _x000D_
Cadet Kaitlyn Frieble, Cadet Ryan Dombeck, and Cadet Juan _x000D_
Patino for posting the colors._x000D_
    I also want to thank everybody for attending this hearing _x000D_
here today._x000D_
    The title of the hearing is The Impact of Federal _x000D_
Regulations: A Case Study of Recently Issued Rules._x000D_
    Let me talk a little bit about this committee, the Senate _x000D_
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It is _x000D_
really two committees from the House combined into one in the _x000D_
Senate. You have the Homeland Security part of the committee, _x000D_
and you have the Governmental Affairs._x000D_
    And the Governmental Affairs part of the committee is a _x000D_
very broad jurisdiction of oversight over pretty much the _x000D_
entire Federal Government. That is really kind of on that side _x000D_
of the committee here today, a broad jurisdictional oversight._x000D_
    When I became Chairman, coming from a business background, _x000D_
I have done a lot of strategic planning. And one thing I _x000D_
definitely realized was very helpful in any business setting _x000D_
was developing a mission and vision statement. And so I went to _x000D_
our Former Chairman, now our Ranking Member, Senator Tom _x000D_
Carper, of Delaware, a person, I think, of real integrity. And _x000D_
I said, let us develop a mission statement for our committee, _x000D_
and so we did. And it is pretty simple: To enhance the economic _x000D_
and national security of America._x000D_
    And so from my standpoint, this hearing, this _x000D_
jurisdictional hearing, over regulations and the effect on our _x000D_
economy really falls under that, enhancing the economic _x000D_
security of this country._x000D_
    We are going to be talking about regulations, primarily _x000D_
focusing on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which I _x000D_
would like to start with a quick question of the members of the _x000D_
panel and the audience. Does anybody here know anybody that _x000D_
does not want a clean environment?_x000D_
    I did not think I would see any hands raised._x000D_
    It is true. We all want a clean environment, something we _x000D_
all value, particularly here in the State of Wisconsin. We have _x000D_
hundreds--I am personally a fisherman. I get my water out of a _x000D_
well. It is a goal of all of ours to keep our environment _x000D_
clean. We really value that. And that is a good thing._x000D_
    Now, the EPA obviously was established on December 2, 1970, _x000D_
to maintain a clean environment in America. And if you really _x000D_
think back to that--I am old enough. I was actually living in _x000D_
those times. On June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland _x000D_
actually set fire. We had some real problems with the _x000D_
environment back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. And so the EPA _x000D_
then made a bipartisan effort to address those abuses. We have _x000D_
come a long way._x000D_
    I would like to just point out the success of the EPA. It _x000D_
was really targeting five primarily pollutants at the time:_x000D_
    Carbon monoxide. Again, the establishment of EPA in 1970, _x000D_
carbon monoxide has gone from 204 million tons to 68. That is a _x000D_
67 percent drop._x000D_
    Nitrogen oxides. From 27 million tons to 12 million tons. _x000D_
That is a 54 percent drop._x000D_
    Soot. From 12 million tons to 2.6 million tons. That is a _x000D_
79 percent drop._x000D_
    Sulfur dioxide. From 31 million tons to 5 million tons. _x000D_
That is an 84 percent reduction._x000D_
    And volatile organic compounds (VOCs), from 35 million tons _x000D_
to 17 million tons. That is a 51 percent drop._x000D_
    Now, all this occurred as our population went from 203 _x000D_
million to about 320 million today. That is about a 56 percent _x000D_
increase. So we have done a pretty good job. We have come a _x000D_
long way. And again, it is a goal, maintaining a clean _x000D_
environment, cleaning up even further, that we all really agree _x000D_
to._x000D_
    I think the purpose of this hearing, though, is to talk _x000D_
about--and, really, the underlying concept is the law of _x000D_
emission returns. We have to evaluate any further action, _x000D_
further reductions. What is the benefit of those reductions in _x000D_
pollution versus what is the cost to society? We always have _x000D_
limits in terms of resources._x000D_
    An example from my own manufacturing background of the law _x000D_
of emission returns is I extruded clear plastic sheet. And _x000D_
sometimes we were called to do jobs that had colors. Now, we _x000D_
would go from clear to a color with a very small percent of _x000D_
color concentrate. But if we wanted to move toward greater and _x000D_
greater opacity, it would require greater and greater amounts _x000D_
of color concentrate to the point where you just were not _x000D_
getting much benefit even though those colors concentrates were _x000D_
expensive and you were having to put an awful lot in there. And _x000D_
I am sure you can all really kind of relate to similar types of _x000D_
examples in your own lives and your own background._x000D_
    So that is really what we are talking about, just a common _x000D_
sense concept of let us take a look at any further regulations _x000D_
as it relates to cleaning up our environment. What is the _x000D_
benefit, the dollar benefit, the total cost? It is just really _x000D_
a common sense approach._x000D_
    I certainly want to use information as much as possible. _x000D_
Now, one of the things I found in this debate on the _x000D_
environment and regulations is solid information is kind of _x000D_
hard to come by. A lot of these things are projecting into the _x000D_
future. We do not have perfect information. It is just hard. As _x000D_
an accountant, I like solid numbers, solid information that _x000D_
everybody can agree on. And that is difficult to get._x000D_
    But one of the ways I think you can get solid information _x000D_
is to put things in perspective. I did not see anything in the _x000D_
testimony----_x000D_
    By the way, I appreciate all of your testimony. I read it _x000D_
all._x000D_
    I did not see anybody talk about the most recently proposed _x000D_
ozone rule. So I would like to talk a little bit about that. To _x000D_
kind of put things in perspective, in 1997, the allowed parts _x000D_
per billion of the ozone in the atmosphere was 80, 80 parts per _x000D_
billion. And so the EPA initiated regulations to drop that to _x000D_
75 parts per billion, which I think, by and large, we have _x000D_
accomplished that. I cannot really tell you how much that cost. _x000D_
I think it is very difficult to figure out exactly how much _x000D_
going from 80 to 75 billion parts per--80 to 75 parts per _x000D_
billion of the ozone--what that cost. But now the EPA has just _x000D_
issued some new regulations to take that from 75 to 70._x000D_
    Let me create an analogy of what we are talking about. _x000D_
Because that sounds pretty good, going from 80 to 75. That is 5 _x000D_
parts per billion. Now it is 75 to 70. That's a 6.7 percent _x000D_
decrease. But here's what it really is. Assume an Olympic size _x000D_
pool. That's 660,000 gallons of water. 660,000 gallons. 75 _x000D_
parts per billion is 38 teaspoons. Dropping that to 70 parts _x000D_
per billion would drop it to 35 and a half teaspoons. And so, _x000D_
again, the question would be, is it worth, in a 660,000-gallon _x000D_
pool that has 38 teaspoons of pollutant--how much are we _x000D_
willing to spend to drop that down to 35 and a half teaspoons? _x000D_
Now, it's all relative. It depends on how nasty that pollutant _x000D_
is. If it's just sand, it's probably not worth anything. If _x000D_
it's something incredibly nasty, it might be worth a fair _x000D_
amount. Again, I just want to kind of put things in _x000D_
perspective._x000D_
    I think I probably said enough in my opening statement. So _x000D_
what I would like to do----_x000D_
    Do we have a list of the order of witnesses? OK._x000D_
    It is a tradition of this committee to swear in the _x000D_
witnesses. So if everybody will stand and raise your right _x000D_
hand----_x000D_
    Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give _x000D_
before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and _x000D_
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?_x000D_
    All Witnesses. I do."
2924783,2924782,2924784,19237,1,"    Please be seated._x000D_
    So our first witness will be Delanie Breuer. Ms. Breuer is _x000D_
the Assistant Deputy Attorney General (AG) for the Wisconsin _x000D_
Department of Justice. She has previously worked for the _x000D_
Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC), providing counsel on _x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF DELANIE M. BREUER,\1\ ASSISTANT DEPUTY ATTORNEY _x000D_
            GENERAL, WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE"
2924784,2924783,2924785,19237,1,"    Good afternoon. Thanks to the University for _x000D_
hosting us, and thank you, Senator Johnson, for having this _x000D_
hearing and giving me the opportunity to provide testimony on _x000D_
behalf of Attorney General Brad Schimel and the State of _x000D_
Wisconsin._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Breuer appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 33._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The health of Wisconsin's economy rests on the back of _x000D_
manufacturing, food processing, pulp and paper, and _x000D_
agriculture. Together, these industries make up the heart of _x000D_
our State, and all of them are in danger due to the EPA's _x000D_
attempt to control our natural resources._x000D_
    Environmental stewardship is important to all of us, but in _x000D_
order to leave our future generations better off, we have to _x000D_
find the balance between protecting our environment and _x000D_
protecting our economy._x000D_
    Over the last 7 years, the EPA has hammered businesses with _x000D_
regulations at a historic pace, but the Waters of the United _x000D_
States rule and the Clean Power Plan (CPP), in particular, are _x000D_
the broadest expansion of EPA authority to date. One gives EPA _x000D_
the authority to regulate almost every pond and puddle, and the _x000D_
other allows the EPA to manipulate the entire electric grid. _x000D_
The industries important to Wisconsin's economy might not _x000D_
survive this onslaught._x000D_
    The Waters of the United States rule (WOTUS), is an attempt _x000D_
by the EPA to control more bodies of water with Federal _x000D_
regulation. Practically speaking, the types of waters now _x000D_
subject to EPA regulation include ditches, ponds with no _x000D_
connectivity to navigable waters, streams that only flow after _x000D_
heavy rains, and the hundred-year floodplain, which is dry 99 _x000D_
years out of a hundred._x000D_
    WOTUS particularly impacts agriculture. The rule adds more _x000D_
red tape and barriers to practical land use here in Wisconsin._x000D_
    Under General Schimel, Wisconsin has joined the fight _x000D_
against this Federal regulatory overreach. Currently the WOTUS _x000D_
rule is stayed pending litigation. A reversal of that stay will _x000D_
irreparably harm Wisconsin and many other States. Wisconsin _x000D_
will continue to support that litigation effort._x000D_
    The Clean Power Plan is the centerpiece of the Obama _x000D_
Administration's intended environmental legacy, but the _x000D_
repercussions of this will devastate Wisconsin's economy for _x000D_
little or no benefit. At its core, the Clean Power Plan is a _x000D_
cap-and-trade plan in disguise, the same type of program _x000D_
promised by President Obama during his campaign and rejected by _x000D_
Congress._x000D_
    In simple terms, the CPP is designed to end coal-fired _x000D_
generation. The devastating impact of this cannot be overstated _x000D_
as it applies to Wisconsin manufacturing. Wisconsin is in the _x000D_
crosshairs of this rule in a way unlike many other States. We _x000D_
have a manufacturing-based economy, and we have low renewable _x000D_
potential we currently rely on clean, reliable coal plants._x000D_
    Since 2000, we have invested $11.6 billion in reducing _x000D_
carbon in the utility sector alone. But still, we are expected _x000D_
to make one of the largest reductions of any State under this _x000D_
final rule._x000D_
    Currently, Wisconsin and 25 other States are seeking a stay _x000D_
of this illegal rule. If we do not get that stay, we have no _x000D_
choice but to begin making huge investments for compliance. _x000D_
Much like the recently litigated MATS rule, the EPA is happy to _x000D_
just force us to make those unnecessary investments, even if _x000D_
the rule is ultimately determined to be illegal._x000D_
    So the great irony of this rule is the impact. At best, it _x000D_
will be minimal. And at worst, it will do exactly the opposite _x000D_
of what the EPA claims to want. By its own calculation, the _x000D_
impact of this rule over the next several decades is so minimal _x000D_
it is practically insignificant. But if we consider the very _x000D_
real consequences of price spikes in electric and gas prices, _x000D_
it is more likely that global emissions will actually increase _x000D_
as a result of the rule. Energy price spikes will reduce _x000D_
manufacturers' margins to a point that they will be forced to _x000D_
relocate. And when they relocate, they are not relocating to _x000D_
the neighboring State. They are relocating to a different _x000D_
country, a country like China or India or Mexico where cheap, _x000D_
reliable coal energy is plentiful and where the very toxic _x000D_
emissions like mercury and SO2 are not controlled at all. Those _x000D_
countries will continue increasing their carbon emissions as _x000D_
well as their economies, and our economy will suffer. Those _x000D_
decisions to move overseas are not easily reversed. And if this _x000D_
rule is not stayed while it is being litigated, those decisions _x000D_
will be imminent._x000D_
    Now, many citizens do not understand the impact of these _x000D_
rules. Consumers will pay more for goods and energies, but that _x000D_
may be a few years down the line. Jobs will move out of the _x000D_
State and out of the country. And ultimately, global pollution _x000D_
could actually increase. The consumers will not blame the EPA. _x000D_
They will blame manufacturers, they will blame utilities, and _x000D_
they will blame farmers._x000D_
    Now, many Wisconsin companies are making the effort on _x000D_
their own to protect the environment. The air and the water in _x000D_
Wisconsin is cleaner than it has ever been, and that was all _x000D_
accomplished without the illegal intervention of the Federal _x000D_
government._x000D_
    There has been a lot of rhetoric thrown around about these _x000D_
EPA regulations. The impact of the rules on our economy--it is _x000D_
not being exaggerated--it will be detrimental and it will be _x000D_
irreversible. These two regulations will result in a regulatory _x000D_
power grab by the Federal Government like we have never seen."

    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Vebber appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 40._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, everyone that is here. I _x000D_
would like to say thanks to the University for having us as _x000D_
well to this beautiful facility._x000D_
    As the Chairman said, I am Lucas Vebber. I am the Director _x000D_
of Environmental & Energy Policy at Wisconsin Manufacturers & _x000D_
Commerce. We are the State's Chamber of Commerce and _x000D_
manufacturers association. We have about 4,000 members of all _x000D_
sizes across every sector of the State's economy. About one in _x000D_
four private sector employees in the State works for a WMC _x000D_
member company. Our members are very concerned about both of _x000D_
these rules._x000D_
    The EPA rules we are here to discuss today are broad, _x000D_
unprecedented expansions of Federal power that will impact a _x000D_
wide variety of our members in very negative ways. Cost _x000D_
estimates put these rules, especially the Clean Power Plan, _x000D_
amongst the most expensive regulations ever promulgated. They _x000D_
were promulgated without a single vote of Congress. In fact, _x000D_
there is actually bipartisan efforts in Congress right now _x000D_
actively trying to stop both rules._x000D_
    These rules will fundamentally change the regulatory _x000D_
environment in Wisconsin and throughout the United States. It _x000D_
will certainly have vast consequences for our economy for a _x000D_
generation. It is going to cost our State tens of thousands of _x000D_
jobs and weaken our economy at a time when we can least afford _x000D_
it._x000D_
    My written testimony that I submitted goes into more detail _x000D_
on what the rules do. I will use the remainder of my time to _x000D_
just highlight a few of the key points on both the rules._x000D_
    The WOTUS rule, is a confusing and unnecessary regulation _x000D_
that puts State business and private property owners at risk. _x000D_
One of the stated goals by EPA in creating the WOTUS rule was _x000D_
to ensure, quote, ``that the waters protected under the Clean _x000D_
Water Act (CWA) are more precisely defined, more predictably _x000D_
determined, and easier for business and industry to _x000D_
understand,'' unquote. Ironically, the actual rule goes in the _x000D_
opposite direction. It creates uncertainty and confusion every _x000D_
step of the way. The uncertainty created by this and the _x000D_
potential for an increased regulatory burden is problematic, _x000D_
not only for manufacturers in our State, but for agricultural _x000D_
producers, private property owners, as well as local and State _x000D_
governments._x000D_
    Given the other industry-specific experts that are on the _x000D_
panel today, I will let them go into specifics about their _x000D_
industries._x000D_
    But I think it is important to note also that the WOTUS _x000D_
rule was introduced as a bill in 2009, Senate Bill 787. It was _x000D_
called the Clean Water Restoration Act. It was introduced _x000D_
because Congress felt they needed to pass a law to enact these _x000D_
changes. Congress at the time had a filibuster-proof majority _x000D_
in the Senate, a majority in the House, and they controlled the _x000D_
White House. The same party controlled all three. They could _x000D_
not get that bill passed. So they proceeded with rulemaking. _x000D_
And that is why the WOTUS rule is here before us today._x000D_
    Suffice it to say, for Wisconsin, this rule does not _x000D_
improve environmental regulation. It really subjects our State _x000D_
to more Federal control. That will mean more regulatory burdens _x000D_
for businesses as well as a greater risk of litigation for our _x000D_
State's employers and private property owners in the State._x000D_
    I would find it hard to believe, as the Chairman said, that _x000D_
there is anyone in our State that thinks regulators and EPA _x000D_
could better manage our State's pristine water resources than _x000D_
the Wisconsinites at DNR. And that is exactly the risk that's _x000D_
created by the WOTUS rule._x000D_
    The Clean Power Plan requires Wisconsin to reduce carbon _x000D_
emissions by 34 percent to 41 percent depending on if our State _x000D_
uses a mass-based or a rate-based approach, respectively. In _x000D_
reality, it is going to be a higher percentage as the baseline _x000D_
year used, 2012, was deliberately chosen due to low natural gas _x000D_
prices that distorted the actual use of coal. Governmental _x000D_
emissions that year were significantly lower than other years, _x000D_
the lowest since the mid 1990s, in fact._x000D_
    There are a lot of questions that need to be answered _x000D_
before we know all the specific impacts on our State, but one _x000D_
thing we know with absolutely certainty is that this rule will _x000D_
raise the cost of energy. Wisconsin produces just over 60 _x000D_
percent of our State's total energy from coal sources. Coal _x000D_
power has proven to be an affordable, efficient, and reliable _x000D_
energy source for the businesses and families of our State. We _x000D_
have made significant investments in coal technology over the _x000D_
past several decades, all as Delanie said, while at the same _x000D_
time obtaining the cleanest air we have had in decades. And it _x000D_
is only getting cleaner._x000D_
    Less coal in our energy generation economy means more use _x000D_
of renewable sources. More renewables means a higher cost. _x000D_
Higher cost means less competitive industries, fewer jobs. It _x000D_
also means less money in the pockets of hardworking Wisconsin _x000D_
families because energy costs are not just something that _x000D_
businesses worry about. Families have to worry about them too._x000D_
    One study on the draft rule projected the job loss to our _x000D_
State at 21,000 jobs for 2030 with a $1.82 billion drop in _x000D_
disposable income. I should note that the final rule actually _x000D_
has a more stringent target for the State of Wisconsin, so we _x000D_
can only expect those numbers to be even worse._x000D_
    The changes necessitated by the Clean Power Plan will also _x000D_
impact the reliability of the electrical group. Natural gas _x000D_
plants will be operated at higher capacities. We will be _x000D_
relying more on renewables. That leaves little wiggle room to _x000D_
ramp up a generation should the sun stop shining or the wind _x000D_
stop blowing. Lack of energy reliability is yet another factor _x000D_
that will negatively impact our State's business climate and _x000D_
drive jobs and investment elsewhere to countries like Mexico _x000D_
and the South Pacific._x000D_
    I should also note that the market is working. We do not _x000D_
need costly mandates from the EPA. We need reasonable _x000D_
environmental regulations, not unreasonable environmental _x000D_
mandates. Our air is getting cleaner. Our State is taking coal _x000D_
plants offline as part of the market process. We have about _x000D_
1,400 megawatts of coal energy being taken offline over the _x000D_
next 5 years. Carbon emissions from energy production _x000D_
nationwide actually declined 10 percent from 2005 to 2013. Yet, _x000D_
the EPA still insists we handcuff American industry at times _x000D_
other countries are actually ramping up coal production, as _x000D_
Delanie said. By some reports, China is bringing on a new coal _x000D_
plant every seven to 10 days._x000D_
    Thank you, again, for giving me the time to speak today on _x000D_
behalf of our State's businesses. I look forward to answering _x000D_
any questions that you may have."

2924788,2924787,2924789,19237,1,"    I want to thank you, Chairman Johnson, and _x000D_
Members of the committee for the opportunity to testify on the _x000D_
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of _x000D_
Engineers (USACE) final rule to define Waters of the United _x000D_
States under the Clean Water Act and, more importantly, the _x000D_
rules' impact on farmers._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Holte appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 49._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My name is Jim Holte. I am a farmer in Elk Mound in Dunn _x000D_
County in the northwestern part of Wisconsin. I raise beef _x000D_
cattle, corn, and soybeans on the same 160 acres that my great _x000D_
grandfather purchased in 1884. Over the years, my farm has _x000D_
expanded to more than 800 acres of cropland, woodland, and _x000D_
buffer areas. Much of the farm is within the Chippewa River's _x000D_
floodplain, but that is not why I am here._x000D_
    This rule is bad for farms everywhere. I am here to tell _x000D_
you, at the very best, that this rule lacks clarity when it _x000D_
comes to permit requirements and farming exemptions. At worst, _x000D_
it is a blatant overreach by the EPA and the Corps._x000D_
    The EPA's actions made a mockery of the notice-and-comment _x000D_
procedures within the Federal Government's rulemaking process _x000D_
in three key areas._x000D_
    First, during the rulemaking process, the EPA dismissed _x000D_
concerns about the rule as being silly or ludicrous or myths. _x000D_
Statements from agency officials made it clear that they really _x000D_
were not listening to objections._x000D_
    Second, the EPA engaged in a PR campaign to solicit support _x000D_
for the rule. The campaign shared blogs, tweets, and YouTube _x000D_
videos about the rules' reported benefits, but failed, with any _x000D_
meaningful information, about the rules' actual content._x000D_
    Third, the EPA allowed its own internal timeline to dictate _x000D_
issuance of the proposed rule before the fundamental scientific _x000D_
study underlying the proposal was complete. It later dictated _x000D_
issuance of the final rule without providing any further public _x000D_
comment._x000D_
    This unchecked process culminated in a deeply flawed _x000D_
regulation whose true costs were never really considered and _x000D_
will not be known for years._x000D_
    I have concerns about how this rule will be implemented and _x000D_
how the Corps of Engineers struggles currently to keep up with _x000D_
its current caseload._x000D_
    I would like to share a short story: In 2013, a farmer by _x000D_
the name of Joe Bragger from Buffalo County wanted to install a _x000D_
temporary bridge over a very small creek on his farm. His _x000D_
application to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources _x000D_
(DNR) was submitted in late December 2013. It took the DNR less _x000D_
than a month to review, approve, and issue a permit application _x000D_
and forward it to the Corps of Engineers for their _x000D_
consideration._x000D_
    More than a year and a half later, the Corps closed out Mr. _x000D_
Bragger's application without a determination or any _x000D_
notification to Mr. Bragger. And it was not until Mr. Bragger _x000D_
requested the assistance from a Farm Bureau employee that it _x000D_
came to light that the Corps had erroneously closed the _x000D_
application file and failed to notify Mr. Bragger of anything._x000D_
    The system is not working as it should. If the Corps cannot _x000D_
sort out what to do with an application for a permit for one _x000D_
temporary bridge over a small creek in Buffalo County, _x000D_
Wisconsin, how on earth do the authors expect the Corps to _x000D_
handle the tens of thousands of additional permits that this _x000D_
rule will trigger for agriculture?_x000D_
    Two years was too long to wait for an answer, nor can _x000D_
farmers wait for 2 years to find out if they can do normal _x000D_
activities like till their fields, apply fertilizers or pest _x000D_
management products. Crazy as it sounds, that is what this rule _x000D_
will require on farms like mine and thousands of others._x000D_
    As I said, much of my farm falls in a floodplain. Yet, even _x000D_
the lowest fields have long-term grassland and wood lot buffers _x000D_
that separate them from the Chippewa River. This rule would _x000D_
stop me from farming any of those fields that are shown on the _x000D_
second and third aerial maps that I provided in my printed _x000D_
testimony._x000D_
    But what is most egregious is the 80-acre field shown on _x000D_
the very first map in that conclusion, that field sits high and _x000D_
dry at an elevation 80 feet above where my home is at. Yet, it _x000D_
will be regulated by this rule because it has some sloping _x000D_
areas where water will run during a normal spring rain. It does _x000D_
not seem to matter that this water has zero opportunity to _x000D_
impact any waterway._x000D_
    In closing, the EPA and the Corps has repeatedly assured in _x000D_
speeches and blogs that the new rule will not increase _x000D_
permitting obligations for farmers or get in the way of _x000D_
farming. These statements are misleading as the examples for _x000D_
agriculture as interpreted by the EPA and the Corps will not _x000D_
protect farmers from burdensome permit requirements and _x000D_
devastating liability under this proposed rule. Bottom line, _x000D_
the Courts are unlikely to give consideration to old speeches _x000D_
and blogs._x000D_
    It is impossible to know how many farmers and landowners _x000D_
will be subject to agency enforcement or sued by private _x000D_
citizen lawsuits, but what is certain is that the vast number _x000D_
of common, responsible farming and forestry practices that _x000D_
occur today without the need for a Federal permit will be _x000D_
highly vulnerable to Clean Water Act enforcement under this _x000D_
rule._x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF HENRY SCHIENEBECK,\1\ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREAT _x000D_
             LAKES TIMBER PROFESSIONALS ASSOCIATION"
2924790,2924789,2924791,19237,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the _x000D_
opportunity to be here today to testify on WOTUS._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Schienebeck appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 96._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    GLTPA believes that WOTUS is a far-reaching, unnecessary _x000D_
rule that provides no documented positive implication for water _x000D_
quality. However, because of the expanded territory, it will _x000D_
undoubtedly add great expense and costs to the operations of _x000D_
farming and forestry. Actually, it is hard to imagine any _x000D_
industry that is not impacted by surface water._x000D_
    The forest industry is the second most financially _x000D_
significant industry in Wisconsin after agriculture, and it _x000D_
generates almost 60,000 direct jobs and over $23 billion in _x000D_
annual activity. Northern Wisconsin's rural communities, in _x000D_
particular, are dependent on forestry for their economic, _x000D_
social, and ecological well-being. Actually, it is our culture, _x000D_
it is our way of life. And a lot of our members are third, _x000D_
fourth, and fifth generation._x000D_
    Due to the naturally wet landscapes of Wisconsin, GLTPA is _x000D_
concerned that WOTUS could irreparably harm Wisconsin's _x000D_
economy._x000D_
    Wisconsin already leads the way in water quality standards _x000D_
associated with forests. In 2013, the Wisconsin Department of _x000D_
Natural Resources conducted 75 audits on State and county _x000D_
timber sales. Best management practices for water quality were _x000D_
correctly applied in 97 percent and 95 percent of the audited _x000D_
sites, respectively. In 2014, the monitoring team visited 58 _x000D_
Federal and large landholder sites and found similar numbers in _x000D_
a positive manner._x000D_
    As it stands, WOTUS seeks to improve water quality by _x000D_
greatly expanding the EPA's already broad authority, thereby _x000D_
reducing local water regulation and control. How could taking _x000D_
control away from people already doing such an exemplary job _x000D_
improve water quality?_x000D_
    EPA may question why GLTPA is concerned about the rule _x000D_
since silviculture currently has an exemption under WOTUS. At _x000D_
this time, it is unclear whether the EPA would seek to remove _x000D_
the silvicultural exemption. Frankly, we do not trust that the _x000D_
exemption will remain in effect for very long. In 2014, the _x000D_
National Resource Defense Council filed a lawsuit seeking to _x000D_
remove the exemption, claiming forest roads cause sediment-_x000D_
laden runoff into WOTUS. Further, EPA itself stated in 2012 _x000D_
that it was looking at regulating forest road runoff._x000D_
    A silvicultural exemption without clear protection of _x000D_
forest roads would mean people could harvest their timber but _x000D_
have no way of removing it from the forest without the _x000D_
permission of the Federal Government. Since there is no _x000D_
evidence removing the exemption will improve water quality, _x000D_
does it make sense to add cost and confusion to an already _x000D_
effective and efficient process?_x000D_
    Given the outstanding job the forest products industry has _x000D_
done in maintaining and even improving water quality, removing _x000D_
this exemption would serve no purpose other than to give the _x000D_
Federal Government expanded jurisdiction. This could cost the _x000D_
industry time and money without additional benefit to the _x000D_
environment. Also, BMP's if WOTUS were to be implemented in _x000D_
place of the State BMPs currently being used by forest _x000D_
managers, the vagueness of the rule would make it very _x000D_
difficult for anyone other than a Federal or affiliated _x000D_
employee to make a determination as to what qualifies as a _x000D_
wetland. Managers would fear being overruled and prosecuted for _x000D_
disturbance of a WOTUS. This would potentially increase cost if _x000D_
a land manager needs to interact with the Corps or the EPA on _x000D_
every decision._x000D_
    EPA has written that the rule does not protect any types of _x000D_
waters that have not historically been covered by the Clean _x000D_
Water Act or add any new requirements for agriculture. This is _x000D_
a very misleading statement. Perhaps the Clean Water Act _x000D_
historically covered wetlands, but it has not covered every _x000D_
drop of water on every piece of land. Under the new WOTUS, _x000D_
every piece of property could be included in wetland _x000D_
regulation, completely stifling or destroying any economic _x000D_
value gained by those resources._x000D_
     Perhaps the rule is not explicitly adding any new _x000D_
requirement for agriculture or silviculture, but how is _x000D_
expanding the regulated land base not requiring more time and _x000D_
money for compliance to expanded EPA and Corps authority? Even _x000D_
though an exemption exists, a farmer must now investigate every _x000D_
potential WOTUS on his property. Even then, because of the _x000D_
vagueness of the rule, he may face government prosecution for _x000D_
up to 5 years after unknowingly having discharged a regulated _x000D_
substance into WOTUS._x000D_
    Despite evidence that current State-level water BMPs are _x000D_
working very well, EPA continues to seek expansion of their _x000D_
authority. It is beyond comprehension that WOTUS will have any _x000D_
significant gain in water quality while expending billions of _x000D_
dollars of taxpayer money that could be put to better use such _x000D_
as reducing the national deficit or dependency on foreign _x000D_
energy._x000D_

2924791,2924790,2924792,19237,1,"    Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson. And thank you _x000D_
for the opportunity to appear here this afternoon. In the _x000D_

    The WEC Energy Group, headquartered in Milwaukee, has $29 _x000D_
billion of assets and employs 9,000 people. We are the eighth _x000D_
largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one _x000D_
of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United _x000D_
States. We provide electric, gas, and steam services to nearly _x000D_
4.4 million customers in four States--Wisconsin, Illinois, _x000D_
Michigan, and Minnesota. Two of our six utilities are in _x000D_
Wisconsin, We Energies is in Milwaukee and Wisconsin Public _x000D_
Service is in Green Bay. We are the largest electric and gas _x000D_
provider in the State, providing half of the electricity and _x000D_
nearly 69 percent of the natural gas delivered to the residents _x000D_
of Wisconsin. Over half of our generation comes from our eight _x000D_
coal plants. All but one of those plants are located in _x000D_
Wisconsin. The seven Wisconsin coal plants are capable of _x000D_
producing over 5,000 megawatts of electricity and employ nearly _x000D_
800 people._x000D_
    Thank you, again, for the opportunity to appear before you _x000D_
today. And thank you for your leadership on this important _x000D_
issue, for your perseverance in pursuing improvements to the _x000D_
Federal permitting process and other regulatory reforms, and _x000D_
for working to keep us safe here at home._x000D_
    I am going to focus my remarks today on the Clean Power _x000D_
Plan because of its significant impacts, but I will be happy to _x000D_
also respond to questions about the Waters of the United _x000D_
States. As you know, the EPA issued its final greenhouse gas _x000D_
rule for existing units in August of this year. We filed _x000D_
comments in response to EPA's proposed rule and also _x000D_
participated in a joint Wisconsin utilities filing. We were _x000D_
pleased that EPA appeared to respond to some of our concerns, _x000D_
mainly the interim target, the safety valve, and trading, but _x000D_
we remain very concerned about some key issues in the EPA final _x000D_
rule, the uncertainty that it brings, the lack of recognition _x000D_
for early action, the 2012 baseline, and the gas dispatch _x000D_
building block._x000D_
    Since 2003, we have invested nearly $12 billion to _x000D_
proactively upgrade our systems and significantly improve the _x000D_
environmental performance of our generating units. We have been _x000D_
leaders in reducing emissions, and we believe EPA should _x000D_
recognize our initiatives, which include investing more than $1 _x000D_
billion in renewable energy, including three large wind farms _x000D_
and a new biomass plant, investing more than 1 and a half _x000D_
billion in state-of-the-art emission control technologies to _x000D_
new and existing units, adding new generation, repowering an _x000D_
older, less efficient coal plant to a combined-cycle natural _x000D_
gas plant, and converting a coal-fueled cogeneration facility _x000D_
to natural gas. We invested in electric and gas distribution _x000D_
system upgrades, and invested in energy efficiency for our _x000D_
customers. As a result of these early actions, the new coal-_x000D_
fueled units at our Oak Creek and Westonsites and the new _x000D_
natural-gas-fueledunits at our Port Washington and Wrightstown _x000D_
sites are among the most efficient in the country._x000D_
    Over the past 15 years, we have increased our generation _x000D_
capacity by more than 40 percent while reducing emissions of _x000D_
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and particulate _x000D_
matter by more than 80 percent. Our CO2 emissions also _x000D_
decreased to a level that is below the year 2000._x000D_
    EPA retained 2012 as the baseline year to calculate State-_x000D_
specific emission rate goals. 2012 is not a representative _x000D_
baseline year. The economy was still recovering, and natural _x000D_
gas prices were unusually low. These factors resulted in a _x000D_
significant reduction in the use of our coal generation._x000D_
    One of the main components in the EPA rule is a series of _x000D_
building blocks. The second building block calls for operating _x000D_
existing gas plants more often. This re-dispatch of existing _x000D_
gas plants is technically feasible but will fundamentally _x000D_
change the operation of our Nation's energy markets from the _x000D_
current practice of economic dispatch to environmental _x000D_
dispatch. Economic dispatch is based on the least cost to our _x000D_
customers. Moving away from economic dispatch to environmental _x000D_
dispatch will increase our customers' costs._x000D_
    In conclusion, EPA's greenhouse gas rule is complex and _x000D_
far-reaching and will significantly change the electric utility _x000D_
industry. There is a great deal of uncertainty throughout the _x000D_
rule, but one thing is certain. Costs will increase for our _x000D_
customers._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, as you know well, we build things in _x000D_
Wisconsin. Wisconsin has a large manufacturing base. And many _x000D_
of those industries and companies rely on electricity to help _x000D_
manufacture their products. An increase in electricity costs _x000D_
could have an impact on their competitiveness, not just in the _x000D_
United States, but abroad as well._x000D_
    Unfortunately, I do not have current cost estimates to _x000D_
provide to the committee at this time. We, along with the other _x000D_
utilities in the State, are modeling our systems and have _x000D_
contracted with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to _x000D_
model the Clean Power Plan and its impact on Wisconsin's State _x000D_
utilities and our customers. Preliminary results should be _x000D_
available next year. EPRI is a recognized expert in the _x000D_
industry._x000D_
    Thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify before the _x000D_
committee and for your leadership on this important issue. And _x000D_
I will be happy to respond to questions as well."

  TESTIMONY OF GEORGE MEYER,\1\ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WISCONSIN _x000D_
                      WILDLIFE FEDERATION"
2924793,2924792,2924794,19237,1,"    Thank you very much, Senator Johnson._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Meyer appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 106._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Before I give my testimony, the Wildlife Federation would _x000D_
like to thank you for your efforts supporting sportsmen on the _x000D_
issue of State management over wolves and your bill that was _x000D_
just introduced this week, your prior efforts in supporting the _x000D_
State Wildlife Grant Program, and your support for attention to _x000D_
Federal lands. We really appreciate that very much._x000D_
    On the issues before us today, the Wisconsin Wildlife _x000D_
Federation represents over 195 hunting, fishing, trapping _x000D_
groups located throughout the State of Wisconsin with a _x000D_
membership of over a hundred thousand members._x000D_
    My personal experience includes 45 years of environmental _x000D_
regulation in the State of Wisconsin. The sportsmen I _x000D_
represent, both in Wildlife Federation and groups like Ducks _x000D_
Unlimited, Pheasants Forever, Trout Unlimited, and scores of _x000D_
other sportsmen's groups across the country, are strongly _x000D_
supportive of the Waters of the United States rule._x000D_
    And it is for very obvious reasons. Those wetlands and _x000D_
small waterways that form the head waters of our streams and _x000D_
lakes in the State provide valuable habitat for fish and _x000D_
wildlife, which is the life blood of our recreational pursuits._x000D_
    But it is not just a cost versus recreational standpoint. _x000D_
We are big business in the country and in this State. In the _x000D_
United States, sportsmen have a total economic impact of $201.4 _x000D_
billion, supporting one and a half million jobs. In the State _x000D_
of Wisconsin, the total economic impact of hunting, fishing, _x000D_
and trapping is $7 billion. We are big business._x000D_
    The WOTUS rule, Waters of the United States rule, has no _x000D_
impact in the State of Wisconsin. And the very reason for that _x000D_
is the first rule was struck down in 2001 by the U.S. Supreme _x000D_
Court. But the citizens of Wisconsin were so concerned about _x000D_
losing that protection of their wetlands and waterways, within _x000D_
90 days, they asked the State legislature to adopt the same _x000D_
regulations under State law. So within 90 days, a bipartisan _x000D_
legislature and a Republican Governor adopted the Federal _x000D_
regulations which had been struck down, which most Federal _x000D_
regulations were stronger than the regulations that are being _x000D_
proposed today. So there is no change in wetlands regulation in _x000D_
the State of Wisconsin because of the Waters of the United _x000D_
States rule._x000D_
    There will be Federal jurisdiction and State jurisdiction. _x000D_
But as there was in the past, there will be a general permit _x000D_
issued by the Federal government to DNR. So anyone that gets a _x000D_
DNR permit automatically gets a Federal permit._x000D_
    So why are we concerned then as sportsmen for the WOTUS _x000D_
rule? Well, we hunt in every State in this country. Right now I _x000D_
have members scattered across the hunter duck hunting or doing _x000D_
other water-based hunting or fishing. We want to be able to go _x000D_
to those other States and enjoy their waterways. Migratory _x000D_
water foul go through--from Canada down through our States down _x000D_
in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana. We want there to be good _x000D_
wildlife water foul habitat in those States so that there will _x000D_
be large enough populations that we will also have water foul _x000D_
in Wisconsin. You need good habitat throughout the flyway._x000D_
    Let us talk about the Clean Power Rule reductions. One of _x000D_
the major concerns raised--and it is a legitimate issue to look _x000D_
at--is the cost of applying the CO2 reduction rules. As was _x000D_
stated previously, we have had strong Federal and State _x000D_
regulation of other pollutants--sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, _x000D_
carbon dioxide. It was because of that Federal and State _x000D_
regulation that we have had those dramatic reductions in those _x000D_
health-problem-causing pollutants. But we have not had CO2 _x000D_
regulations, which have a major impact on climate change and _x000D_
the future of our planet. These are the first regulations of _x000D_
those nature in the U.S. Government. And despite voluntary _x000D_
efforts--and there has been some good voluntary efforts by _x000D_
companies in the State--we are not going to get the kind of _x000D_
reductions we need without regulations. And are not going to be _x000D_
able to get countries like China or Russia or India to step up _x000D_
to the plate if, in fact, we do not show the leadership in this _x000D_
country to reduce carbon reductions._x000D_
    An estimate of the costs have been put together in the _x000D_
State by the Public Service Commission and the Wisconsin _x000D_
Department of Natural Resources that, in fact, the cost would _x000D_
be between 4 billion to $13 billion. I can go into the reasons _x000D_
that those are based on faulty assumptions during my written _x000D_
testimony. But one thing I have learned over 45 years of _x000D_
environmental regulation is that those costs are always _x000D_
substantially overestimated when the rule goes into effect. And _x000D_
my experience is that the final cost is usually between 10 to _x000D_
20 percent of the estimates._x000D_
    And for my tenure as secretary of the DNR, I will give you _x000D_
an example. There was a regulation put into place by the United _x000D_
States to reduce toxic wastewater discharges into the Great _x000D_
Lakes. It is called the Great Lakes Initiative. Industry _x000D_
estimated that in eight Great Lakes States, by regulating the _x000D_
discharges for municipalities and industries into the Great _x000D_
Lakes, it would cost industry and municipality $13 billion. And _x000D_
it allocated $2 billion of those costs to the Wisconsin _x000D_
industry and municipality. We scratched our heads in Wisconsin _x000D_
because we had adopted the same regulations 8 years earlier, _x000D_
and the true cost in Wisconsin was $200 million._x000D_
    I found that to be true in virtually every cost estimate _x000D_
for implementing major environmental regulations over my _x000D_
career._x000D_
    Thank you very much."
2924794,2924793,2924795,19237,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Meyer._x000D_
    I would like to point out before we go into questions that _x000D_
we did invite the EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, to appear _x000D_
here and testify, and she declined. Again, I realize she is _x000D_
pretty busy. So we did ask if she would send a representative, _x000D_
and she did not, which is very unfortunate._x000D_
    We held a field hearing like this in Tomah after the _x000D_
tragedies within the Tomah Veterans Affairs (VA) health care _x000D_
facility. And the VA sent us two really high quality _x000D_
witnesses--it was extremely helpful. They heard the powerful _x000D_
testimony. And as a result, the VAs actually responded. The VA _x000D_
office inspector general retired after deep-sixing about 140 _x000D_
reports. And the doctor who was prescribing opiates--they _x000D_
called him Dr. Candy Man or the Candy Man--has been terminated. _x000D_
So it was extremely helpful that the agencies actually came to _x000D_
a State to hear directly from people affected by their _x000D_
decisions._x000D_
    So it was very disappointing that the EPA would not send a _x000D_
representative. But this is the first step in the process. I _x000D_
mean, this will be something we will continue to explore. And _x000D_
if we have to go to Washington D.C., I might ask a couple of _x000D_
you to travel. I hope you would not mind. But we do have to get _x000D_
the actual agency hearing the stories from Wisconsin as well._x000D_
    Mr. Meyer, let me quick start with you. How many years did _x000D_
you work with the DNR?"
2924795,2924794,2924796,19237,1,32
2924796,2924795,2924797,19237,1,"    32 years. So you have a fair amount of _x000D_
experience with the DNR."
2924797,2924796,2924798,19237,1,    I do. I am an older guy.
2924798,2924797,2924799,19237,1,"    Well, I was not implying that. I have _x000D_
white hair too._x000D_
    I really worked very cooperatively with the DNR in my 37 _x000D_
years in the plastics business and always appreciated their _x000D_
expertise. I did not get the sense that the DNR lacked concern _x000D_
for our environment. I would say they really were concerned _x000D_
about the environment. Is that true?"
2924799,2924798,2924800,19237,1,    Very true.
2924800,2924799,2924801,19237,1,"    So why isn't the DNR in Wisconsin, who is _x000D_
very concerned about the environment, as we all are--why isn't _x000D_
their regulation over Wisconsin's environment adequate?"
2924801,2924800,2924802,19237,1,"    I think it is. And I think my testimony on the _x000D_
Waters of the United States rule is that, in fact, the State is _x000D_
covered. It has been covered except for 90 days in the year _x000D_
2001. And, in fact, that is why I think the adoption of the _x000D_
WOTUS rule is not going to have an impact on forestry and _x000D_
agriculture and the industry in the State of Wisconsin. I do _x000D_
believe in the system that was created by the Federal _x000D_
Government when the Federal Government adopts a regulation and _x000D_
then delegates authority to the States and allows the States to _x000D_
do the regulation._x000D_
    And while one of the methods in the Clean Power Rule is to _x000D_
allow the State here--it sort of gives the goal of what has to _x000D_
be done in terms of reductions but then allows a State to work _x000D_
with its utilities to come up with the right combination, as _x000D_
Bruce indicated, of the various components to tailor-make the _x000D_
regulation to that State and then let the State enforce those _x000D_
regulations. So it is a combination."
2924802,2924801,2924803,19237,1,"    Yes. I would say the Federal Government _x000D_
really did take that attitude, kind of stepping back and _x000D_
letting States really run these things. Maybe, that is a pretty _x000D_
good argument._x000D_
    But do you understand businesses and organizations are _x000D_
concerned that sometimes the Federal Government, even though _x000D_
they say they are not going to get involved, get involved in an _x000D_
awful lot and can do some definite overreaching? I mean, do you _x000D_
understand the concern of the other people on the panel here?"
2924803,2924802,2924804,19237,1,"    I understand the fear. But I found that very few _x000D_
times in my tenure with the DNR, and the head of the _x000D_
enforcement division before I was secretary--that there were _x000D_
very few times, less than a handful--and that covers 20 years _x000D_
in my career where there was overfiling by the Federal _x000D_
Government, that they stepped in where the State did not want _x000D_
to. And some of the situations were dealing with State _x000D_
facilities because they knew the political pressure on the DNR _x000D_
did not regulate the Department of Administration."
2924804,2924803,2924805,19237,1,"    I mean, the concern here is that the _x000D_
Federal Government is ramping up its jurisdiction over the _x000D_
States, though. They have, in some respects, taken a step back._x000D_
    And this is where I really want to go to Ms. Breuer to talk _x000D_
about the history of the Federal Government and federalism as _x000D_
it relates to environmental control. And, obviously in Article _x000D_
1, Section 8, we have the commerce clause, which does allow the _x000D_
Federal Government to get involved in interstate commerce and _x000D_
regulating it._x000D_
    And then in 1824, in Gibbons versus Ogden, in a unanimous _x000D_
Supreme Court decision, they extended the regulation under the _x000D_
commerce clause over navigable waters. And to me, that makes _x000D_
sense._x000D_
    Let us say you have a stream in Wisconsin that enters into _x000D_
the St. Croix River, then dumps into the Mississippi. If you _x000D_
are polluting that stream, it is not just going to affect _x000D_
Wisconsin. It is going to start affecting Minnesota, Iowa, and, _x000D_
all the other States downstream._x000D_
    It is about navigable water. I do want to quick read the _x000D_
definition of navigable water by the Army Corps of Engineers. _x000D_
``Navigable waters of the United States are those waters that _x000D_
are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide,'' ocean tide, _x000D_
``and/or are presently used or have been used in the past or _x000D_
may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign _x000D_
commerce.'' That is pretty clear, and that makes an awful lot _x000D_
of sense. And that's really been the standard for almost 200 _x000D_
years. And it really has not been under dispute. The Federal _x000D_
Government does have--because it is really a national treasure, _x000D_
these navigable waters._x000D_
    Can you just kind of speak to how this is different when we _x000D_
start talking about Waters of the United States?"
2924805,2924804,2924806,19237,1,"    Sure. So one of the things that Waters of the _x000D_
United States rule does is diminish the certainty with regard _x000D_
to what they call neighboring waters or adjacent waters to _x000D_
navigable waters. So the common citizen thinks navigable water _x000D_
is one that I can paddle a boat down--right? or drive a boat _x000D_
down. And the EPA is now saying, well, basically anything that _x000D_
flows into a navigable water is also our jurisdiction, and that _x000D_
includes ponds that are within certain distances of navigable _x000D_
waters, even when there is absolutely no connectivity. So the _x000D_
DNR in the State cannot regulate someone who builds a pond on _x000D_
their land that has no connectivity to a navigable water, but _x000D_
now the EPA has potential jurisdiction over those on private _x000D_
land, on public land. It does not matter._x000D_
    And the neighboring waters, it is really just about where _x000D_
they are distance-wise in relation to navigable waters._x000D_
    This rule really expands what we think of as navigable _x000D_
waters to touch pretty much anything, including the streams _x000D_
that run through farms and land that do not even have water _x000D_
running on them every day, every year."
2924806,2924805,2924807,19237,1,"    But again, you were actually using a more _x000D_
expansive definition of navigable waters than the Army Corps. _x000D_
Again, the Army Corps is very clear that it has to be affected _x000D_
by the tides. Is there any water in Wisconsin that's affected _x000D_
by the tides other than the Great Lakes?"
2924807,2924806,2924808,19237,1,    Maybe the Mississippi.
2924808,2924807,2924809,19237,1,"    OK. Or have been used in the past, _x000D_
presently used, or susceptible for use to transport interstate _x000D_
or foreign commerce. I mean, little streams that----"
2924809,2924808,2924810,19237,1,    Right.
2924810,2924809,2924811,19237,1,"    Intermittent streams, things that dry up _x000D_
when it is not raining, they cannot be----_x000D_
    That is actually a very clear definition; correct? Has _x000D_
there been an expansion in law beyond that definition?"
2924811,2924810,2924812,19237,1,"    No. The expansion has come through the rules, _x000D_
which we argue in our lawsuit is illegal and violates the _x000D_
commerce laws. And that is one of the main arguments that we _x000D_
put forth in the challenge to the Waters of the United States _x000D_
is that this is a complete constitutional violation."
2924812,2924811,2924813,19237,1,"    Mr. Holte, in your testimony, you talked _x000D_
about an attempt in 2009. It was the Clean Water Restoration _x000D_
Act. This is, again, in the first two years of Obama _x000D_
Administration where they had a 60-vote filibuster-proof _x000D_
majority in the Senate. A strong----_x000D_
    Oh, I am sorry. Mr. Vebber."
2924813,2924812,2924814,19237,1,    Yes.
2924814,2924813,2924815,19237,1,"    A strong majority in the House. And there _x000D_
is a recognition that on the part of Congress and in the party _x000D_
that is in control, that in order to change the definition of _x000D_
navigable water, they actually had to pass a law. Can you _x000D_
describe a little bit more about that?"
2924815,2924814,2924816,19237,1,"    Sure. Absolutely._x000D_
    You saw the bill introduced, which would have changed the _x000D_
definition of--it would have changed navigable waters to Waters _x000D_
of the United States in Federal law. That bill was introduced _x000D_
because members of Congress felt that they needed a law to make _x000D_
that change. That law was not passed, despite having what could _x000D_
have been a path to passage there with majorities of both _x000D_
Houses and control of the White House."
2924816,2924815,2924817,19237,1,    How far did it get?
2924817,2924816,2924818,19237,1,"    I believe it got through the Committee process _x000D_
and then never passed on the floor._x000D_
    But unfortunately then, shortly 120 thereafter, we saw the _x000D_
administration forward the rule, a rule that was based largely _x000D_
on the bill that failed to pass._x000D_
    I think you see similar things playing out, unfortunately, _x000D_
in other EPA rules. You see the Clean Power Plan, for example, _x000D_
anticipates some type of a cap-and-trade system which has been _x000D_
introduced time and time again in Congress and time and time _x000D_
again rejected._x000D_
    It is a troubling State of affairs certainly."
2924818,2924817,2924819,19237,1,"    In the Clean Water Restoration Act, the _x000D_
information I have is, again, they were not trying to redefine _x000D_
navigable waters. They were just trying to increase the _x000D_
jurisdiction of the Federal Government over different types of _x000D_
waters and wetlands._x000D_
    Included in the definition would be including intermittent _x000D_
streams. Anybody know what an intermittent stream is? Is there _x000D_
a pretty exact definition of that somewhere in law?"
2924819,2924818,2924820,19237,1,    It does not flow all the time.
2924820,2924819,2924821,19237,1,"    OK. So that would be a long ways from _x000D_
navigable water then; correct? You certainly would not be able _x000D_
to use an intermittent stream to engage in interstate or _x000D_
internet--or foreign trade and commerce; correct?"
2924821,2924820,2924822,19237,1,    Right.. You would not.
2924822,2924821,2924823,19237,1,"    OK. So that would be a significant _x000D_
expansion of the navigable water standard; correct?_x000D_
    Prairie potholes. Anybody know what a prairie pothole is? _x000D_
Kind of a----"
2924823,2924822,2924824,19237,1,    Great place to duck hunt.
2924824,2924823,2924825,19237,1,"    Duck hunt. OK._x000D_
    Wet meadows?_x000D_
    And then I--actually, a playa lake. That is just a bigger _x000D_
prairie pothole, I think, is what that is._x000D_
    Again, all these things are intermittent and a long way _x000D_
from navigable for the use of interstate or foreign trade and _x000D_
commerce; correct?_x000D_
    So, again, the point I am trying to make is this really is _x000D_
an attempt for a dramatic increase in jurisdiction by the _x000D_
Federal Government over waters within States. Again, this is a _x000D_
Federal system here that I would agree with, Mr. Meyer, that _x000D_
the DNR really is concerned. By the way, so are Wisconsinites. _x000D_
We are really concerned about our environment. We are a bunch _x000D_
of hunters. I am a fisherman. We really are concerned about _x000D_
that._x000D_
    And I guess that is the question. Is the Federal Government _x000D_
really more concerned about Wisconsin's environment than we _x000D_
are? And is it worth the concern? I think it is a legitimate _x000D_
concern in terms of the Federal Government coming in here and _x000D_
creating an awful lot of uncertainty in terms of permitting, _x000D_
and exactly how to comply."
2924825,2924824,2924826,19237,1,"    I am confident Wisconsin can handle it because _x000D_
of our legislation, but what I am not confident is that other _x000D_
States are going to be able to do the same thing without some _x000D_
Federal involvement."
2924826,2924825,2924827,19237,1,"    OK. One of the things we have to consider _x000D_
is the potential penalties. And who is best able to talk about _x000D_
the fact that, I have seen reports that potentially 92 percent _x000D_
of land mass of Wisconsin be subject to the Waters of the _x000D_
United States."
2924827,2924826,2924828,19237,1,    No.
2924828,2924827,2924829,19237,1,"    OK. So I would like to have a discussion _x000D_
there._x000D_
    Also, potentially, per violation, $37,000 per day could be _x000D_
the potential fines if you do not obtain the necessary permit._x000D_
    It looks like Mr. Holte would like to talk to that."
2924829,2924828,2924830,19237,1,"    Yes. You mentioned about the amount of the land _x000D_
in the State that could be subject to control. And that really _x000D_
comes to the point that we made about the vagueness of the _x000D_
rule. You could easily take this rule and interpret it to say _x000D_
that when I have an inch and a half of rain on my sloping _x000D_
ground and the water runs in little rivulets off it, that _x000D_
becomes the Waters of the United States."
2924830,2924829,2924831,19237,1,    That would be like an intermittent stream.
2924831,2924830,2924832,19237,1,"    I guess it could be._x000D_
    But the impact is that, therefore, in that stream, I now _x000D_
need a permit in order to do tillage, I need a permit in order _x000D_
to spread fertilizer or manure, I need a permit to apply any _x000D_
crop protection products on any ground that has enough slope _x000D_
that water can run off it in a two-inch rain. And there comes _x000D_
where our great concern in agriculture is where this could--by _x000D_
the simple interpretation of the rule where it is vague, it _x000D_
could include, as you say, 80, 90 percent of the ground in _x000D_
Wisconsin._x000D_
    We have asked, as an organization, the EPA to take a look _x000D_
at five or six different farms across the country and give us _x000D_
interpretations on those areas. They have declined. We still _x000D_
struggle with this vagueness._x000D_
    And again, as they have gone through the process of _x000D_
creating this rule and taking comments and testimony and then, _x000D_
in the end, implemented a stricter rule, in the tip of a pen, _x000D_
they can eliminate any exemptions we currently have. And we _x000D_
have no recourse, no legislative recourse. This is done without _x000D_
any legislation passing. That kind of capitalizes the concerns _x000D_
we have in agriculture--the vagueness, the ability to eliminate _x000D_
any exemptions that are there very simply and quickly. We think _x000D_
it is a great overreach._x000D_
    And if we had some opportunity for the Corps and EPA to _x000D_
come and visit with us on farms and show us how it would work, _x000D_
we would have a lot more comfort, but we have not been able to _x000D_
do that."
2924832,2924831,2924833,19237,1,"    So why is that not a valid concern about _x000D_
kind of a capricious----"
2924833,2924832,2924834,19237,1,"    Well, unfortunately----"
2924834,2924833,2924835,19237,1,    Of those rules?
2924835,2924834,2924836,19237,1,"    I would agree with Jim. I think the EPA and the _x000D_
Corps should come and provide those examples._x000D_
    But this EPA regulation is actually weaker than the one _x000D_
that was in effect up until 2001._x000D_
    And I have a lot of experience. I cut my teeth on wetlands _x000D_
regulation and waterway regulation, and it did not include that _x000D_
percentage of Federal regulation of land in the State of _x000D_
Wisconsin._x000D_
    But I think you should have the right to be shown exactly _x000D_
how it is going to apply on your farm."
2924836,2924835,2924837,19237,1,"    That comes to the point, George, of our concern _x000D_
about the vagueness of the rule and the ease of changing the _x000D_
interpretation and, therefore, vastly change the impact of the _x000D_
rule._x000D_
    And as I explained--and there is where--a lot of _x000D_
Wisconsin's farmland slopes. I mean, anywhere from the 2 to 6 _x000D_
and 6 to 12 percent of slopes are very common. And those could _x000D_
easily, by just interpretation, be interpreted to be a Waters _x000D_
of the United States. Because when I have a two-inch rain in _x000D_
late April and water runs off that ridge in different areas, _x000D_
now that whole hillside is a Waters of the United States. And I _x000D_
have to have a permit to do all those things I talked about."
2924837,2924836,2924838,19237,1,"    Mr. Holte, in your testimony, you also _x000D_
talked about the exemption of ongoing farming, but you say that _x000D_
your concern was because the exemption was originally enacted _x000D_
in 1977. But the only farmland that would be exempted would be _x000D_
something that has been in continuous farm use since 1977."
2924838,2924837,2924839,19237,1,"    Well, that----"
2924839,2924838,2924840,19237,1,    Can you speak to that? That is really----
2924840,2924839,2924841,19237,1,"    That gets into some of the details of whether or _x000D_
not farmland is continuously operated, if it changes owners or _x000D_
change--goes from a parent to a child or, that is one more of _x000D_
the vague issues that we have great difficulty with, maybe not _x000D_
as extreme in that particular example, but in the vagueness of _x000D_
where exemptions apply and do not and what really does _x000D_
constitute a Water of the United States and what is an _x000D_
intermittent stream? Is it one that occurred once in the last 8 _x000D_
years on this hillside of mine, or is it one that has to occur _x000D_
monthly every year?_x000D_
    Again, our great discomfort comes with the vagueness and _x000D_
the ease of changing of the interpretation of the rule by just _x000D_
a changing of the rule with no congressional oversight."
2924841,2924840,2924842,19237,1,"    Mr. Holte, I believe it is also in your _x000D_
testimony you expressed some concern about the way the EPA _x000D_
actually marketed or solicited comments outside the way they _x000D_
normally do. I mean, normally the way the comment is supposed _x000D_
to work with the Federal agency is they are supposed to issue _x000D_
the rule as kind of a neutral arbiter. And then based on that _x000D_
rule proposal, they are supposed to solicit pretty much in an _x000D_
unbiased fashion comments from the public that would be _x000D_
affected by that; correct? Can you say how this was different?"
2924842,2924841,2924843,19237,1,"    Well, that is very accurate._x000D_
    From the very beginning of this rule's forming and _x000D_
composition and coming forward, our organization across the _x000D_
whole country has been very concerned. And so we took a great _x000D_
deal of activity and participation in the process of commenting _x000D_
on it. And it was as if our--because we were contrary to where _x000D_
the rule was going, our comments were made to seem unimportant. _x000D_
And there's occasions where they even discredited us as being--_x000D_
what was it?--silly or ludicrous or--or carrying on myths. So _x000D_
was it their place to judge our character in the submission of _x000D_
the rules, or is it their place to accept all submissions of _x000D_
comments regardless of where they come from? And that is the _x000D_
point I had made, Chairman."
2924843,2924842,2924844,19237,1,"    I had written an oversight letter to Mr. _x000D_
Howard Shelanski, the administrator of the Office of _x000D_
Information and Regulatory Affairs, concerned about that. _x000D_
Because we do actually have a law, the Antilobbying Act, makes _x000D_
it a Federal crime to use appropriated money to influence, _x000D_
quote, ``in any manner a Member of Congress, a jurisdiction, or _x000D_
an official of any government to favor, adopt, or oppose any _x000D_
legislation, law, ratification, policy, or appropriation.'' The _x000D_
EPA was really utilizing social media to solicit comments that _x000D_
were favorable to their ruling. Do you have that similar type _x000D_
of concern?"
2924844,2924843,2924845,19237,1,"    I do. In this whole process, I would have to _x000D_
step back and say that the EPA, I think, in their minds, has an _x000D_
honorable goal. And they saw this as something they needed to _x000D_
do to protect resources. But what they failed to do was have _x000D_
understanding of what actually happens on the ground. And by _x000D_
this they discredited the process of submitting opinions and _x000D_
comments, and they are not taking under serious concern those _x000D_
of us that are on the ground every day. And that is one of the _x000D_
greatest concerns I had."
2924845,2924844,2924846,19237,1,"    OK. Which is, again, why we invited an EPA _x000D_
representative to listen to testimony, provide testimony _x000D_
themselves. By the way, they have a statement for the record, _x000D_
which we will enter._x000D_
    But it would have been nice to have them here, and we could _x000D_
have bounced some of these ideas off them. Mr. Schienebeck."
2924846,2924845,2924847,19237,1,    Yes?
2924847,2924846,2924848,19237,1,"    I have done an awful lot--and by the way, _x000D_
you have been helpful--I appreciate it--touring the timber land _x000D_
and learning an awful lot in the last 5 years._x000D_
    Can you compare--this is a little bit off topic, but I _x000D_
think it is relevant. Can you compare the permitting process _x000D_
for harvesting timber from a county standpoint to a State _x000D_
standpoint to trying to harvest timber in a Federal forest? Can _x000D_
you just kind of talk a little bit about that? Because I think _x000D_
it is somewhat relevant to the issue we are talking about here, _x000D_
how the ease with which we can do this so we can maintain _x000D_
healthy forests. County, State, to Federal Government."
2924848,2924847,2924849,19237,1,"    Well, actually, a lot of the permitting _x000D_
for a stream crossing would go through the Department of _x000D_
Natural Resources. And we would get into the Corps----_x000D_
    For us, a navigable stream is something that we can put a _x000D_
canoe in anytime of the year and float a canoe. It does not _x000D_
matter how far as long as it can hold a canoe at that point in _x000D_
time. So for----"
2924849,2924848,2924850,19237,1,"    But that is a far stricter or more _x000D_
stringent standard than what the Army Corps lists as a _x000D_
navigable water; correct? So the DNR has a much tighter _x000D_
standard for navigable water than what the Army Corps does; _x000D_
correct?"
2924850,2924849,2924851,19237,1,    Yes.
2924851,2924850,2924852,19237,1,"    Mr. Meyer, you agree with that?"
2924852,2924851,2924853,19237,1,"    Yes. That is our BMPs for water quality. _x000D_
That is what we follow for forestry operations. I mean, that is _x000D_
in our manual."
2924853,2924852,2924854,19237,1,"    Let me quick--because I think it might _x000D_
have been when I was on tour with you. I have heard reports--_x000D_
again, it is just anecdotal--that the way the DNR determines _x000D_
whether they can float a canoe is they will definitely pick a _x000D_
really wet day after a really heavy rainstorm with a really _x000D_
light canoe or--and--kayak._x000D_
    And then they will--if they can float that thing on initial _x000D_
water, that is navigable. Is that----"
2924854,2924853,2924855,19237,1,"    We used to like those 80-pound kayakers._x000D_
    We really liked them."
2924855,2924854,2924856,19237,1,"    OK. So obviously--I mean, basically you _x000D_
have heard that. So the point being is, the DNR is far more _x000D_
stringent in terms of its definition of navigable water here in _x000D_
Wisconsin to protect our environment than the Army Corps is _x000D_
under current navigable water standards."
2924856,2924855,2924857,19237,1,    Yes
2924857,2924856,2924858,19237,1,"    Yes. I would agree with that._x000D_
    And the difference is--I mean, if you are on county timber _x000D_
lands, they do a super fantastic job of managing their lands. _x000D_
They provide all the benefits-- ecological, environmental, all, _x000D_
social, everything that we need._x000D_
    The State does a very good job, I would say, in Wisconsin._x000D_
    And I also represent a lot of people in Michigan, and _x000D_
Michigan does a great job as well._x000D_
    And the Federal forests are getting a lot better._x000D_
    They are kind of going back to where we were 10 or 15 years _x000D_
ago. And I think a lot of that is due, in part, because you _x000D_
have come up, Senator Baldwin has been to our forests many _x000D_
times, and we have gone out and looked at them._x000D_
    And good neighbor authority is going to be a huge help in _x000D_
implementing more of that management._x000D_
    The fact of the matter is that we are all really concerned _x000D_
about the environment and--all of the forests because they are _x000D_
all multiple-use forests."
2924858,2924857,2924859,19237,1,"    But again, from that standpoint, good _x000D_
neighbor authority is really moving more toward the type of _x000D_
approval process, sort of the one-stop approval process, in our _x000D_
State process versus the multiple approval process for _x000D_
harvesting on Federal; correct? That is I really want you just _x000D_
to kind of get into who the agency is State versus Federal--and _x000D_
what that approval process is in terms of the timber _x000D_
harvesting."
2924859,2924858,2924860,19237,1,"    Well, I mean, first of all, if you are _x000D_
going to do a timber harvest, you have to have an approved _x000D_
plan. And that has to be approved by a certified plan writer. _x000D_
And then you set up that management plan. And if you are going _x000D_
right along, we will just expedite this whole process. Then you _x000D_
would set that timber sale up._x000D_
    And it really depends upon the amount of paperwork. Let us _x000D_
say if I am doing a private timber sale, my contract might be _x000D_
two, three, four pages. If I am doing a county timber sale, the _x000D_
most of them that I have done are no more than 8 to 10 pages. _x000D_
If I am doing a Federal timber sale, it is going to be a _x000D_
hundred pages and----"
2924860,2924859,2924861,19237,1,"    And it is a multiple-step process; right? _x000D_
So it is----"
2924861,2924860,2924862,19237,1,    Yes.
2924862,2924861,2924863,19237,1,"    County land and State, you get that _x000D_
approval process once, and you can go in and correct? You go _x000D_
through----"
2924863,2924862,2924864,19237,1,"    Well, they all have their own approval _x000D_
process. So they are separated out that way. But once we have _x000D_
that approval, we move forward."
2924864,2924863,2924865,19237,1,"    But in Federal, you get the approval. And _x000D_
then there is another chance, really, for litigation."
2924865,2924864,2924866,19237,1,"    Well, not----"
2924866,2924865,2924867,19237,1,    That is how it was described to me.
2924867,2924866,2924868,19237,1,"    Yes. I mean, once I buy the sale, it is _x000D_
good to go._x000D_
    But to get to that point, first, when they do their 10 to _x000D_
15-year plan, there is a lot of people that put comments in, so _x000D_
on and so forth. But then once the plan is approved, which is _x000D_
probably what you are referring to, is when we had our 15-year _x000D_
plan in place. But then when they go to put up those sales, _x000D_
then the litigants come forward and they want to sue after the _x000D_
plan has already been approved. So then----"
2924868,2924867,2924869,19237,1,"    That is what I am talking about. In the _x000D_
State, you do not have that capability."
2924869,2924868,2924870,19237,1,"    Right. We do not have that--necessarily _x000D_
all that red tape that we go through. But it is quite common on _x000D_
the Federal forest._x000D_
    And so we have the plan. They set up--let us just say. That _x000D_
is multiple timber sales up there. And litigants come forward _x000D_
and wanted to stop the sale. And actually, there has been a _x000D_
couple instances where the sales were actually sold, but they _x000D_
were litigated. So the foresters actually had to buy the sale _x000D_
back from the person that won the bid because they could not _x000D_
get in there for a 10-year period._x000D_
    And it starts out, in a particular instance over by Laona, _x000D_
it was a 12-year process to get through that whole litigation _x000D_
to bring everybody together. There was, like, endangered _x000D_
species there such as ginseng, those type of things. So to get _x000D_
through that whole process was a 12-year process. And that is _x000D_
where we see where WOTUS could have a huge impact."
2924870,2924869,2924871,19237,1,"    There is your concern. If the Federal _x000D_
Government gets involved and claims jurisdiction over these _x000D_
things, you are concerned, just like in terms of harvesting _x000D_
timber, to produce jobs, but also to keep the forests healthy. _x000D_
I mean, that is probably the greatest impression I have had as _x000D_
I have taken the tours. Those forests that are managed where we _x000D_
actually allow timber harvesting are far healthier. There is _x000D_
far more animals in those forests as opposed to the old growth _x000D_
ones. I mean, they look kind of cool. They are kind of spooky, _x000D_
but they are dying."
2924871,2924870,2924872,19237,1,"    Yes. Absolutely._x000D_
    And here is one of our major concerns. And I think _x000D_
everybody in here that is a landowner would have the same _x000D_
concern. And we have a lot of private landowners in Wisconsin. _x000D_
If I want to come onto your property, build a road to get in _x000D_
there, do my harvesting, and get out, I am going to spend about _x000D_
1,200 bucks to get across the 40. And I am just going to make _x000D_
this simple. Let us say we are going to do a mile of road. If I _x000D_
am just going to do a simple mile of road, I am going to look _x000D_
at about $4,400. I will get in there, do my harvest, get out. _x000D_
And that road will be there for the next----"
2924872,2924871,2924873,19237,1,"    And it is the property owner that makes _x000D_
the decision whether he is going to let you do----"
2924873,2924872,2924874,19237,1,    Yes.
2924874,2924873,2924875,19237,1,"    And you can work out a deal in terms of _x000D_
any kind of remediation or covering up the road or sodding over _x000D_
it with that landowner."
2924875,2924874,2924876,19237,1,"    Yes. So let us say that if we are going to _x000D_
look at WOTUS, we are going to look at every water pocket that _x000D_
is on that road. Now I am going to have to spend probably about _x000D_
$8,000 because I am going to want to make sure that if you want _x000D_
that road to remain on your property for the next entries into _x000D_
your property, if there is any water sitting anywhere that _x000D_
generates any type of plant or a cattail or anything like that, _x000D_
now I am going to be required to get a permit to use that sale _x000D_
the next time. And if I want to make sure there is going to be _x000D_
no water sitting anywhere on that road, I am going to be _x000D_
spending about $38,000 to put a road in because it is going to _x000D_
be graveled, ditched, crowned. It is going to have every _x000D_
feature of basically a spec road. That means you, as the _x000D_
landowner, are going to get less money. That means I am going _x000D_
to take less money as a producer. But it also means that there _x000D_
is going to be zero improvement in water quality because none _x000D_
of those ponds or none of those borrow pits that I might have _x000D_
created are going to have anything to do with water quality."
2924876,2924875,2924877,19237,1,    Because it is not navigable water.
2924877,2924876,2924878,19237,1,    Exactly.
2924878,2924877,2924879,19237,1,"    And again, now with the State rules, you _x000D_
do not have to go through any of that process. You still have _x000D_
the DNR jurisdiction in some way, shape, or form."
2924879,2924878,2924880,19237,1,"    Yes. And we follow best management _x000D_
practices._x000D_
    Senator Johnson.: You have that already done. It works in _x000D_
the State of Wisconsin. And you really do not need the Federal _x000D_
Government butting in and creating high levels of uncertainty._x000D_
    Mr. Meyer, do you understand the concern?"
2924880,2924879,2924881,19237,1,"    I do. But there will be--what is happening when _x000D_
there has been dual restriction, since 1977, is that the _x000D_
Federal Government has deferred to the State government and _x000D_
stayed out of it so ."
2924881,2924880,2924882,19237,1,    But they are not----
2924882,2924881,2924883,19237,1,"    There was actually a joint application. We _x000D_
filled out one application. The State issued the permit. It _x000D_
covered the Federal permit. And Henry would not have to build _x000D_
that road any differently than he does right now for the State _x000D_
government."
2924883,2924882,2924884,19237,1,"    Well, what has changed since 1977 until _x000D_
today, the standard was navigable water where the Wisconsin DNR _x000D_
has a more stringent definition of navigable water than the _x000D_
Army Corps. And now that would be changing under this."
2924884,2924883,2924885,19237,1,"    The standard you read was the former standard _x000D_
from jurisdiction of the Federal Government, but that changed, _x000D_
and the 1972 Clean Water Act was far broader._x000D_
    Now, the regulations that got struck down in 2001 took the _x000D_
tip off of that broader jurisdiction. But there was far greater _x000D_
jurisdiction between the Federal navigable water standard and _x000D_
that covered by the 1972 Clean Water Act._x000D_
    Most of the water in this State is covered by the Clean _x000D_
Water Act, not just those subject to time."
2924885,2924884,2924886,19237,1,"    OK. Where would I find the current _x000D_
definition of navigable water?"
2924886,2924885,2924887,19237,1,"    Well, for navigable water, that would be in the _x000D_
Section 10 of the--and I forget what law or regulation, but it _x000D_
goes back to the turn of last century. But the Clean Water Act _x000D_
jurisdiction is in the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act."
2924887,2924886,2924888,19237,1,"    OK. Well, I will check that out."
2924888,2924887,2924889,19237,1,    Please.
2924889,2924888,2924890,19237,1,"    I mean, this is my understanding that this _x000D_
was the current."
2924890,2924889,2924891,19237,1,    It is a complicated variable believe me.
2924891,2924890,2924892,19237,1,"    I think, everybody's concern. I am a _x000D_
business guy. I like keeping things as simple as possible._x000D_
    Mr. Meyer, let us talk a little bit about costs of some of _x000D_
these regulations."
2924892,2924891,2924893,19237,1,    Sure.
2924893,2924892,2924894,19237,1,    I mean Mr. Ramme.
2924894,2924893,2924895,19237,1,    OK.
2924895,2924894,2924896,19237,1,"    You stated that costs will increase. We _x000D_
just do not have the figure at the tip of your fingers._x000D_
    President Obama, when he was a candidate, was talking about _x000D_
his proposed cap-and-trade policy. And he said, if enacted, _x000D_
because of his cap-and-trade proposal, electricity rates would _x000D_
necessarily skyrocket. That little chunk, that is an exact _x000D_
quote. Do you agree with what Candidate Obama said back then, _x000D_
that, his policy as it relates to the power plant, power _x000D_
generation, will cause electricity rates to skyrocket?"
2924896,2924895,2924897,19237,1,"    I would say already, over the last half of a _x000D_
dozen years or so, we have seen so many regulations occurring._x000D_
    If we go to this Clean Power Plan that we are talking about _x000D_
and the Waters of the United States, I see increased costs _x000D_
coming from both._x000D_
    And in the case of the Waters of the United States, it just _x000D_
adds additional complexity. Now we are running electric or gas _x000D_
lines somewhere. We have to go spend the time to figure out, is _x000D_
it a jurisdictional ditch or not? So a lot of this is about _x000D_
ditches, really, in there. And Wisconsin already has very _x000D_
protective rules._x000D_
    On the Clean Power Plan side, if we look at that, we do not _x000D_
have our estimates yet. Whatever number I would give you today _x000D_
I can just about guarantee would be wrong. And so I do not want _x000D_
to do that. And----"
2924897,2924896,2924898,19237,1,"    Of course, isn't that part of the problem _x000D_
is we just, in the end, never know? I mean, the costs end up _x000D_
being hidden? Nobody, in the end, really accounts for them in _x000D_
terms of when these things were implemented. And 5, 10 years _x000D_
later, now they have been--people have spent the money. And you _x000D_
have your costs. And you go to the Commission and submit your _x000D_
rates, and you get--because you can justify the costs, rates go _x000D_
up. And who ends up paying for that?"
2924898,2924897,2924899,19237,1,"    All of our customers. And I said in my testimony _x000D_
there that the cost will increase. I am confident of that. It _x000D_
is just by how much in this case._x000D_
    And I think these are very complex rules. And, we have been _x000D_
analyzing them. We have commented on the proposals and when _x000D_
they came out. And we keep learning things, as we go through _x000D_
these rules._x000D_
    The other thing that goes on, I think George mentioned, _x000D_
that a lot of times the estimates tend to come in lower than _x000D_
originally projected. And that may be true in some cases _x000D_
because there is a lot of uncertainty that comes with the rule._x000D_
    And, you are looking at how are we going to do it? Once _x000D_
this becomes a regulation or rule, we have to rise to the _x000D_
occasion and find a way to meet those requirements. And, _x000D_
sometimes we are very good at that. And in this case, I think _x000D_
this is more challenging than usual."
2924899,2924898,2924900,19237,1,"    Well, in my background memo, one of the _x000D_
things the staff listed for me a number of different standards. _x000D_
And these actually come from the Department of Energy. Things _x000D_
like refrigerator efficiency standards and water heaters. For _x000D_
example, in 2011, the refrigerator efficiency standard _x000D_
increased the price of a refrigerator by $83. In 2010, the _x000D_
water efficiency standard increased the cost of a water heater _x000D_
by $464. A fluorescent lamp, $12. Another one for a fluorescent _x000D_
lamp is $3. Electric motor efficiency standard, $313. A walk-in _x000D_
cooler--now, probably not a whole lot of people buy walk-in _x000D_
coolers--but, $1,086. You just total the whole thing up, just _x000D_
from 2009 to 2014, some of these efficiency standards, if you _x000D_
were unlucky enough or lucky enough to be able to afford to buy _x000D_
all these products, that is about $2,400 of increased cost on _x000D_
the product that is pretty hidden._x000D_
    And isn't that part of the problem that you in the end, we _x000D_
just all end up paying----_x000D_
    I would ask the question--because I have seen different _x000D_
studies. And one of the reasons I do not throw out the numbers _x000D_
is because, I see a wide variation of it. But does anybody have _x000D_
a study or a quote or figure in terms of estimates of how much _x000D_
it costs per Wisconsin family some of these regulations on _x000D_
energy? Anybody want to step up to the plate on that one?"
2924900,2924899,2924901,19237,1,"    I can speak to it a little bit. It is more of a _x000D_
percentage than an actual number. I was very intimately _x000D_
involved in the modeling that Mr. Meyer does not like that the _x000D_
PSC did. So I was very close to this in my last position at the _x000D_
Public Service Commission. And it is more of a percentage. And _x000D_
it is double digits, 10 to 25 percent._x000D_
    The reason there is such a range in the cost estimates, the _x000D_
4 to 13 billion, is because of the different compliance options _x000D_
and the different ways that different plants are treated._x000D_
    One way to come into compliance with this plan is to build _x000D_
all new natural-gas-fired plants. Take a bulldozer to the rest _x000D_
of your old fleet even though you are still paying for that. _x000D_
Because those new plants are under a different standard. They _x000D_
are not under the 111(D). They are under the 111(B). And so _x000D_
they do not really count under 111(D). That is not a practical _x000D_
solution, but it is the lowest cost option._x000D_
    And the better way to do it is to keep some of your coal _x000D_
online for reserve, but then you are going to have to buy _x000D_
credits from somewhere else. And that is a more expensive _x000D_
option._x000D_
    So it is more about a percentage increase than an actual _x000D_
number. Because right now the large energy users that Lucas _x000D_
represents carries so much of the burden of the infrastructure _x000D_
costs that if they start going away, then all of the _x000D_
residential bills will go up even more because they will have _x000D_
to pay for what industry was previously paying for."
2924901,2924900,2924902,19237,1,"    Mr. Ramme, you talked about investing 13, _x000D_
$14 billion already. Do you have a calculation in terms of what _x000D_
that--obviously you invested that money. That goes into your _x000D_
rates. Do you know how much those investments have increased _x000D_
the families' of energy costs?"
2924902,2924901,2924903,19237,1,"    It was, I think, $12 billion that I cited there. _x000D_
And, I would have to go back and look at the revenues over that _x000D_
period of time. Sorry. I don't know that."
2924903,2924902,2924904,19237,1,    OK.
2924904,2924903,2924905,19237,1,    I can get back to you with that.
2924905,2924904,2924906,19237,1,"    But again, those are costs. And those do _x000D_
get allocated into rates; correct?"
2924906,2924905,2924907,19237,1,    They are very real as far as that goes so .
2924907,2924906,2924908,19237,1,"    OK. Ms. Breuer, I did really want to _x000D_
talk--because you did not cite in your testimony the actual _x000D_
decision, but the Chevron decision. You were talking about how _x000D_
the agencies, particularly over time, have really become, I _x000D_
would say, a little more vague in their regulations because of _x000D_
that Chevron decision by the Supreme Court that basically says _x000D_
that the agencies themselves will be responsible and, really, _x000D_
be looked upon for guidance in terms of, what the law actually _x000D_
says._x000D_
    Now, I want to just quickly quote some examples of what we _x000D_
are doing here in Congress in terms of writing frameworks for _x000D_
laws rather than the actual laws. But both Obamacare and Dodd-_x000D_
Frank. And I always get them mixed up. But I think Dodd-Frank _x000D_
was 350,000 words. Obamacare was 380,000 words when passed. The _x000D_
last time I looked, about a year ago, Dodd-Frank was up to 15 _x000D_
million words, and Obamacare was over 12 million words. An _x000D_
enormous amount of law being written by the agencies._x000D_
    And then the Supreme Court relies on the agencies in terms _x000D_
of how to interpret it; correct? Can you just kind of speak to _x000D_
that? Because you did allude to that in your testimony."
2924908,2924907,2924909,19237,1,"    Yes, absolutely._x000D_
    It is sort of a fill-in-the-blank game. The regulations, _x000D_
the laws, and then subsequently the rules are written _x000D_
intentionally vague, in my opinion, so that, later on, the _x000D_
agency can mold that law to do what they want it to do._x000D_
    So one example is the Clean Power Plan. They are using _x000D_
Section 111 of the Clean Air Act that has so rarely been used _x000D_
that nobody really knows what it means. And they are relying on _x000D_
Chevron deference to be able to interpret that law to mean what _x000D_
they want it to mean._x000D_
    And that is exactly the concern with the Clean Water Act _x000D_
and the Waters of the United States rule as well. If they leave _x000D_
it vague, if they do not add clarity, then maybe not next year, _x000D_
maybe not the following year, but in 5 years, they are going to _x000D_
say, well, we really want more control over the farms and the _x000D_
hillside of Wisconsin, so this is what we really meant to say _x000D_
back then._x000D_
    And even more concerning is the holes that they leave in _x000D_
those regulations, leave the folks subject to those regulations _x000D_
open for citizen lawsuits. And any ambiguity in these _x000D_
regulations just encourages citizen lawsuits from Sierra Club _x000D_
or others which costs a lot of money to defend and bring no _x000D_
value to the farmers and the timber workers of Wisconsin."
2924909,2924908,2924910,19237,1,"    Can anybody here on the panel speak the _x000D_
process of sue and settlement?"
2924910,2924909,2924911,19237,1,    I can speak a little as well.
2924911,2924910,2924912,19237,1,    OK. Sure.
2924912,2924911,2924913,19237,1,"    We see this in the utility industry on occasion _x000D_
where an environmental group or an NGO will bring a case _x000D_
against the EPA, trying to force the EPA to move in a certain _x000D_
direction. And then that group and the EPA will settle even _x000D_
though, relatively speaking, they Are on the same side. So they _x000D_
will settle. And then, the folks on the other side of the issue _x000D_
are not really brought into those discussions._x000D_
    And we have seen it with some of the past national ambient _x000D_
air quality standards. The utilities have to negotiate consent _x000D_
decrees with the EPA, and the State regulators have no say in _x000D_
that. So the utilities and the EPA agree to spend a certain _x000D_
amount of money on upgrading, your fire-power heater, your wood _x000D_
heater, or what have you. And then they bring it to the Public _x000D_
Service Commission of the State. And the Public Service _x000D_
Commission--the State regulators have no choice but to allow _x000D_
the utilities to do it and to charge it back to their _x000D_
customers. So it is an agreement between basically the _x000D_
environmentalists and the EPA. But they are using rate payer _x000D_
and taxpayer dollars to pay off that settlement. And it is _x000D_
frustrating, and it is a broken process."
2924913,2924912,2924914,19237,1,"    And it pretty well renders Congress pretty _x000D_
much useless----"
2924914,2924913,2924915,19237,1,    That's right.
2924915,2924914,2924916,19237,1,    And which means the people.
2924916,2924915,2924917,19237,1,    And State regulators as well.
2924917,2924916,2924918,19237,1,"    I think final line of questioning, I would _x000D_
like to talk to Mr. Ramme about the 2012 baseline._x000D_
    And I think, Mr. Meyer, you might have a different opinion _x000D_
on that._x000D_
    So can you just kind of talk a little bit about the way the _x000D_
EPA set those rules and why the 2012 baseline, which is really _x000D_
penalizing in terms of Wisconsin?"
2924918,2924917,2924919,19237,1,"    Well, if we look back at 2012, it was a year _x000D_
where the economy was not doing very well. And it was also a _x000D_
year that natural gas prices were unusually low. So that _x000D_
combination resulted in the natural gas generation facilities _x000D_
running much more than they ever had."
2924919,2924918,2924920,19237,1,    Which would have lower CO2 emissions.
2924920,2924919,2924921,19237,1,    Right.
2924921,2924920,2924922,19237,1,    OK.
2924922,2924921,2924923,19237,1,"    And, of course, if those facilities are running _x000D_
and the economy is not going great, the coal facilities are not _x000D_
running as much. And so the CO2 emissions were much lower that _x000D_
year._x000D_
    But again, when you look at the cost of natural gas, it is _x000D_
not representative. And the CO2 emissions are not _x000D_
representative. And the coal plants running were not _x000D_
representative. It is very, advantageous to take a baseline _x000D_
year of 2012 and then look at reductions out in 2030 and--as _x000D_
you do that because you already have a head start there."
2924923,2924922,2924924,19237,1,"    Well, advantageous to who?"
2924924,2924923,2924925,19237,1,    To the regulator.
2924925,2924924,2924926,19237,1,    EPA?
2924926,2924925,2924927,19237,1,"    And so that is why that really isn't, we feel--_x000D_
--"
2924927,2924926,2924928,19237,1,"    Mr. Meyer, you had a slightly different _x000D_
thought on that."
2924928,2924927,2924929,19237,1,"    I do. But I will preface it by saying I am not _x000D_
an expert in this, and Mr. Ramme knows quite a bit._x000D_
    I made two points. One is, yes, if you had used 2005, a _x000D_
maybe advantageous base, but you have had to make more major _x000D_
reductions. And the estimate is half the companies of the _x000D_
utilities in the Nation would be complaining more than they are _x000D_
now, including some in the State of Wisconsin._x000D_
    I mean, while I was not involved in studying the baseline _x000D_
year for this, you can never pick a perfect baseline year. By _x000D_
definition, it is arbitrary and depends where you are as an _x000D_
individual company or a State. You may have a State that is in _x000D_
a slump, be treated differently, and some States roaring. So _x000D_
there is never a perfect number._x000D_
    In 2005 this would have resulted in, we believe, more _x000D_
complaints by utilities with regard to it._x000D_
    Now, the other thing that I think is important is to have _x000D_
the baseline year, but also, under the State plan--and I know _x000D_
Bruce and some other companies made reductions during the 2005, _x000D_
2012. And while that isn't taken into account in the baseline _x000D_
year, it can be taken into account in the compliance plan by _x000D_
the State of Wisconsin. And the State can adjust it saying this _x000D_
utility did quite a bit before then, so we are not going to _x000D_
impose as much. There is that kind of flexibility in the law--_x000D_
or in the regulations to allow those judgments be given credit. _x000D_
Is it perfect? No._x000D_
    One thing that really concerns me about this rule is I am _x000D_
sure there could be a better rule than this, a better plan, but _x000D_
no one else is laying one out there. We have a climate change _x000D_
problem in this world. We need to deal with it. And I give _x000D_
credit to the EPA for doing it. It may not be perfect, but we _x000D_
need one."
2924929,2924928,2924930,19237,1,"    OK. Well, what I would like to do is give _x000D_
everybody an opportunity and just kind of wrap up the hearing _x000D_
and spend about a minute--I do not want you waxing on too long _x000D_
here. I want to respect everybody's time because people have _x000D_
been very patient. But if you have something that you really _x000D_
want to reveal or talk about that has not been either asked or _x000D_
you did not get an earlier opportunity----_x000D_
    So we will start with you, Ms. Breuer."
2924930,2924929,2924931,19237,1,"    Yes. I will just reiterate that, General _x000D_
Schimel and the State of Wisconsin feels that it is in the best _x000D_
interests of Wisconsin citizens to fight this type of _x000D_
regulatory overreach, not because we do not like the _x000D_
environment, but because we do think that it is State _x000D_
regulators and Wisconsinites who know our energy system best, _x000D_
who know our land best, and know the best way to use it. And we _x000D_
are the largest overreach we have seen in decades. And we are _x000D_
going to do everything we can from a litigation perspective to _x000D_
stop that."
2924931,2924930,2924932,19237,1,"    Thank you, Ms. Breuer. Mr. Vebber."
2924932,2924931,2924933,19237,1,"    Yes. That was well said. And I would say that _x000D_
in Wisconsin, it has been said today that we make things. We _x000D_
are a manufacturing heavy State. We have members who use over a _x000D_
million dollars a month in energy. When you drive up the cost _x000D_
10 to 25 percent of that, that is a serious expense that is _x000D_
going to drive jobs out of our State. Manufacturers make up .15 _x000D_
percent of the total customer base, but they use a third of the _x000D_
energy. If those manufacturers start leaving, that means that _x000D_
the rest of the energy costs in the State are going to go up _x000D_
dramatically on families and other businesses. And that is _x000D_
going to be devastating._x000D_
    So thank you, again, for allowing us to testify today, and _x000D_
I appreciate it."
2924933,2924932,2924934,19237,1,    Mr. Holte.
2924934,2924933,2924935,19237,1,"    Well, I guess I would come back to the point I _x000D_
made earlier about the vagueness of the rule and the _x000D_
opportunity for it to change and be interpreted differently _x000D_
down the road with no opportunity for us to change that. And _x000D_
that vagueness gives us a great sense of discomfort."
2924935,2924934,2924936,19237,1,    Mr. Schienebeck.
2924936,2924935,2924937,19237,1,"    Like what I used to be, many of our _x000D_
members are independent businessmen. And we comply with _x000D_
everything we can comply with obviously. We care about the _x000D_
trees and the forests more than anybody. Because if you are a _x000D_
logger, the last thing you want to do is run out of trees to _x000D_
cut. And we have more trees now than we have ever had. I mean, _x000D_
we are well beyond the late 1800s and 1900s. And even then we _x000D_
did not actually run out of trees._x000D_
    And as an independent businessman, we are seeing more and _x000D_
more costs added on, and we have nowhere to pass those costs _x000D_
on. I mean, the utility company, they can raise my rates._x000D_
    If I am buying equipment when we are right in the final _x000D_
stage of a Tier 4 engine. That added $18,000 on to the cost of _x000D_
the machine. Now we are talking Tier 5 engine, and that is _x000D_
going to be probably $30,000 onto the cost with such a minute--_x000D_
you talked about the teaspoons before. This would be a thimble _x000D_
for the gain of the cost. Quite honestly, we cannot afford to _x000D_
pay the costs anymore of these overreaching rules that have no _x000D_
benefit to them."
2924937,2924936,2924938,19237,1,"    Again, those trees did grow back, and they _x000D_
did have to have some CO2 to grow back."
2924938,2924937,2924939,19237,1,"    Absolutely. And we had a Council on _x000D_
Forestry meeting today. And we just had another lesson about _x000D_
CO2. And we have trees, and they are absolutely (inaudible)."
2924939,2924938,2924940,19237,1,    I could not help myself. Mr. Ramme.
2924940,2924939,2924941,19237,1,"    Well, I guess the last comment I would make is _x000D_
certainly to acknowledge that the legal challenges need to run _x000D_
their course. And hopefully they can occur in a timely fashion. _x000D_
And we have to get back to a balance of, environmental _x000D_
protection and considering the economy."
2924941,2924940,2924942,19237,1,    OK. Mr. Meyer.
2924942,2924941,2924943,19237,1,"    I started working for the Department of Natural _x000D_
Resources before the Clean Water Act, and before the Clean Air _x000D_
Act. And you could not eat the fish here in Stevens Point. You _x000D_
could not swim the rivers. Snowbanks were covered with soot and _x000D_
coal. And it did take Federal intervention to, in fact, cleanup _x000D_
those waters and lakes. We have done a good job, and the _x000D_
citizens have done a good job._x000D_
    We need Federal intervention on climate change. And this _x000D_
rule does it for the first time."
2924943,2924942,2924944,19237,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Meyer, for your efforts. _x000D_
And again, we agree on so much because we are here in _x000D_
Wisconsin, we love our environment, and we want to keep it _x000D_
clean._x000D_
    So, again, I just want to thank all the witnesses for your _x000D_
thoughtful testimony, for taking the time, for your thoughtful _x000D_
answers to my questions._x000D_
    I certainly want to thank UW-Stevens Point here for opening _x000D_
up this room. It is a beautiful facility. We appreciate that._x000D_
    And in particular, I want to thank Bill Rowe and his team _x000D_
and campus security._x000D_
    We want to thank all of the members of the audience in _x000D_
being very respectful, in taking the time to hear everybody _x000D_
out._x000D_
    This has been a good hearing. This is just a first step. We _x000D_
will, have a hearing in Washington D.C., and we will get the _x000D_
EPA in there, and we will hear their side of the story. And _x000D_
hopefully, they will also listen to some of these, I think, _x000D_
very legitimate concerns by business interests. This is going _x000D_
to affect our economy in some way, shape, or form. We can argue _x000D_
on exactly how much because it is just very difficult to _x000D_
calculate these things in perspective and even retrospectively. _x000D_
But it does have an economic impact, which is why this is of _x000D_
interest to this Committee._x000D_
    So again, I want to thank everybody for their attendance _x000D_
and their participation._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 15 days until _x000D_
November 28 at 5 for the submission of statements and questions _x000D_
for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned._x000D_
    At 2:41 p.m., the Committee was adjourned._x000D_

2924944,2924943,2924945,19238,1,"    This hearing will come to order. I wanted _x000D_
to do an opening statement, and then Senator Carper is on his _x000D_
way. Senator Johnson is also on his way, and so as they slip _x000D_
in, we will recognize them at the appropriate time as well. I _x000D_
want to have this Committee come to order so we can begin this _x000D_
process on time today._x000D_
    I would like to welcome everyone to this afternoon's _x000D_
hearing on the ``2020 Census: Challenges Facing the Bureau for _x000D_
a Modern, Cost-Effective Survey.'' I will begin by recognizing _x000D_
myself for this opening statement._x000D_
    Director Thompson, let me first say to you on behalf of the _x000D_
Committee, we would like to express all of our condolences on _x000D_
the loss of Lawrence Buckner. We lost him in the line of duty _x000D_
on April 9 in Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. _x000D_
Know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the agency _x000D_
as you all walk through this time together. It was a senseless _x000D_
act of violence, and we will all walk through it together with _x000D_
his family._x000D_
    The United States Constitution mandates that an actual _x000D_
enumeration be made within 3 years after the first meeting of _x000D_
the Congress of the United States and every subsequent 10 _x000D_
years._x000D_
    As the 2020 decennial census approaches, I appreciate the _x000D_
fact that the Census Bureau is actually taking steps to prepare _x000D_
since, as we have seen in the past, a failure to do so can _x000D_
drastically increase costs for the Federal Government and _x000D_
ultimately the taxpayers. It is laudable that the Bureau is _x000D_
working toward implementation of an innovation strategy with _x000D_
the goal of saving the taxpayers' money._x000D_
    However, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO), has _x000D_
noted, although progress has been made since 2010, more work is _x000D_
needed to ensure that technology systems are fully operational _x000D_
and information remains secure and confidential._x000D_
    While it is important that we have information regarding _x000D_
the makeup of this Nation, it is also important that we _x000D_
safeguard the privacy of the American people. Questions asked _x000D_
of citizens of this Nation must be cost-effective and should _x000D_
not be overly intrusive. When the questions go too far and _x000D_
exceed what we should ask from the U.S. Government, it is _x000D_
invasive and fuels an environment of distrust._x000D_
    It is important that we examine not just the preparation _x000D_
for the 2020 Census itself, but also the manner in which the _x000D_
Census and other surveys, like the American Community Survey _x000D_
(ACS), are being conducted, as well the substantive nature of _x000D_
the questions asked. I look forward to the testimony, and I _x000D_
will acknowledge the Ranking Member Senator Carper for his _x000D_
opening statement when he arrives as well._x000D_
    Let me introduce the witnesses. Then I am going to swear _x000D_
the witnesses in as we go from here._x000D_
    John Thompson is the Director of the Census Bureau. Before _x000D_
his appointment as Director, Mr. Thompson was the President and _x000D_
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the National Opinion Research _x000D_
Center (NORC). Thanks again for being here._x000D_
    Robert Goldenkoff is the Director of Strategic Issues at _x000D_
the GAO. Mr. Goldenkoff leads reviews of the governmentwide _x000D_
civil service reforms and ways of improving the cost-_x000D_
effectiveness of the Federal statistical system._x000D_
    Carol Cha is the Director of Information Technology _x000D_
Acquisition Management Issues at the Government Accountability _x000D_
Office. Before joining GAO, Ms. Cha led numerous reviews of _x000D_
information technology (IT) systems at Federal agencies, _x000D_
including the Departments of Commerce, Defense (DOD), and _x000D_
Homeland Security (DHS)._x000D_
    Thank you, all three of you, for being here, and thanks for _x000D_
your testimony, both your written testimony and the oral _x000D_
testimony that you are about to begin as well._x000D_
    I would like to ask unanimous consent that Senator _x000D_
Johnson's statement be included in the record.\1\ Without _x000D_
objection, so ordered._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 33._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee that we swear in all _x000D_
witnesses, so would you please rise and raise your right hand? _x000D_
Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?"
2924945,2924944,2924946,19238,1,    I do.
2924946,2924945,2924947,19238,1,    I do.
2924947,2924946,2924948,19238,1,    I do.
2924948,2924947,2924949,19238,1,"    Thank you. You may be seated._x000D_
    Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in _x000D_
the affirmative._x000D_
    I will ask that each of you will give your testimony. You _x000D_
have plenty of time to be able to do that. We are glad that you _x000D_
came and you came well prepared on that. When Senator Carper _x000D_
comes, I will recognize him for an opening statement. That may _x000D_
be in between one of you, but I will not interrupt you in the _x000D_
middle of your statement if he comes in during that time._x000D_
    Mr. Thompson, you are first. Thank you. We would be glad to _x000D_
receive your testimony now._x000D_
_x000D_
 TESTIMONY OF HON. JOHN H. THOMPSON,\1\ DIRECTOR, U."
2924949,2924948,2924950,19238,1,"    Thank you, Senator Lankford. I would also _x000D_
like to thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper and _x000D_
the Committee for allowing me this opportunity to testify on _x000D_
our preparations for the 2020 Census._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Thompson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 38._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Before I testify, however, I would like to take a moment to _x000D_
honor a true hero, Officer Lawrence Buckner, who lost his life _x000D_
protecting all of us at the U.S. Census Bureau. We are _x000D_
profoundly saddened by the loss of Officer Buckner. No one can _x000D_
ever measure the loss to his family. But our hearts are full, _x000D_
and the Census Bureau extends its deepest sympathy to his wife, _x000D_
Linda, his son, Lawrence, and his family. Thank you, and we _x000D_
mourn this tragic loss._x000D_
    I will now proceed with my testimony. The Census Bureau is _x000D_
fundamentally changing the way we will conduct the decennial _x000D_
census, which is the largest civilian mobilization in the _x000D_
United States. These efforts began earlier this decade by _x000D_
establishing a goal to design and conduct the 2020 Census to _x000D_
cost less per housing unit than the 2010 Census, while _x000D_
maintaining the highest levels of quality._x000D_
    The Census Bureau then identified the major cost drivers, _x000D_
and with the Congress' support, we began researching and _x000D_
testing major innovations oriented around technology and the _x000D_
strategic use of information to rein in these cost drivers._x000D_
    Today I will describe our work in four key innovation areas _x000D_
that will lead to the reengineered 2020 Census. We believe that _x000D_
investing now in these four key innovation areas can yield up _x000D_
to $5 billion in savings relative to repeating the 2010 Census _x000D_
in 2020. The tests we conducted in 2013 and 2014 and the four _x000D_
tests we are conducting this year are informing the 2020 Census _x000D_
design decisions, which we will deliver later this year. I will _x000D_
discuss how these tests informed our planning and how the next _x000D_
2 years position us for the critical end-to-end test in 2018. _x000D_
The alternative is repeating the 2010 Census, which would _x000D_
forfeit the savings of $5 billion._x000D_
    There are four key areas of innovation and potential _x000D_
savings:_x000D_
    First, better address validation. By using the U.S. Postal _x000D_
Service (USPS) and other information sources, including aerial _x000D_
imagery, we plan to avoid walking every street in the Nation to _x000D_
validate the address list. We can save $1 billion through these _x000D_
efforts._x000D_
    Second, better response options. By making responding to _x000D_
the Census more convenient through the Internet, phone, or by _x000D_
mail, we can potentially save approximately $550 million._x000D_
    Third, better use of existing information. By using _x000D_
existing government and commercial information to reduce the _x000D_
need to follow-up with non-responding housing units, we can _x000D_
potentially save $1.2 billion._x000D_
    Fourth, better field operations. By using technology to _x000D_
manage and track cases, as well as to route the Census takers _x000D_
who will be using smartphones and tablets rather than pencil _x000D_
and paper, we can potentially save $2.3 billion._x000D_
    As I noted above, the total savings we expect from these _x000D_
four areas of innovation is $5 billion. I will now discuss each _x000D_
of these innovation areas in more detail._x000D_
    The foundation of an accurate Census is an accurate address _x000D_
list, which includes both the address and the geospatial _x000D_
location. Over the past few years, there have been tremendous _x000D_
technological advances in the geospatial field. More and more _x000D_
data become available, meaning that we no longer have to _x000D_
validate every address by a personal visit. We are now _x000D_
examining how to refine our procedures to integrate private _x000D_
sector data and services to update our geospatial assets. _x000D_
Specifically, we want to purchase address, road, and satellite _x000D_
imagery instead of physically walking the entire United States._x000D_
    This year's Address Validation Test encompasses two _x000D_
components that will also bring insights into how we can build _x000D_
a better address frame. The first component is to assess the _x000D_
ability of statistical models to predict change, such as new _x000D_
roads, new housing units, or other changes. The second _x000D_
component will provide measures of the current accuracy of our _x000D_
address list and our geospatial database._x000D_
    The second area of innovation is developing better response _x000D_
options. We are moving away from relying solely on the mailed _x000D_
questionnaire and enumerator to count every household. We are _x000D_
expanding options for people to self-respond by the Internet, _x000D_
at home or on a mobile device remotely, as well as by _x000D_
telephone. However, it is important to note that paper will _x000D_
continue to be an option._x000D_
    We want to make the Census as mobile and convenient as _x000D_
possible. This means allowing respondents to answer the Census _x000D_
without entering a Census ID. In fact, we anticipate that by _x000D_
promoting the Internet option, there will be a dramatic _x000D_
increase in the number of these responses in 2020. For this to _x000D_
work, we must validate these responses quickly in real time._x000D_
    The third area of innovation is better use of existing _x000D_
information. The increased use of administrative records from _x000D_
other Federal and State government agencies and third-party _x000D_
commercial data can reduce costs. The use of administrative _x000D_
records is not new to the decennial census, and we want to _x000D_
expand our use of these data for the 2020 Census. We are _x000D_
exploring several options, and two of the most promising are _x000D_
using those data to help manage and even reduce the field _x000D_
workload._x000D_
    The two most significant areas of innovation and cost _x000D_
savings are removing vacant units and using existing _x000D_
information on persons to enumerate occupied housing units, _x000D_
thereby removing them from the non-response follow-up _x000D_
operations._x000D_
    For example, during the 2010 Census, the field workload _x000D_
included 50 million housing units. Each housing unit received _x000D_
at least one in-person visit. Of these, 19 million were either _x000D_
vacant or no longer existed. By using administrative data from _x000D_
the Postal Service and other agencies, we believe we can _x000D_
identify these vacant and non-existent housing units and remove _x000D_
them from the in-person follow-up workload, achieving _x000D_
substantial cost savings._x000D_
    Administrative records may also us to enumerate occupied _x000D_
housing units rather than enumerate them directly, and I would _x000D_
like to have a conversation with the Congress about this _x000D_
potential step._x000D_
    Ultimately, we will have to send Census takers into the _x000D_
field to enumerate the remaining non-responding households, _x000D_
which underscores the importance of the fourth area of _x000D_
innovation: better field operations. As part of the research _x000D_
and testing, including the 2015 Census test in Maricopa County, _x000D_
Arizona, we are examining our field staffing structure and _x000D_
testing several technological innovations. The goal of _x000D_
reengineering our field operations is to use technology more _x000D_
efficiently and effectively to conduct and manage the 2020 _x000D_
Census field workload._x000D_
    In previous Censuses, the entire process, both data _x000D_
collection and management, was conducted by paper and pencil. _x000D_
To measure progress, we had to rely on daily in-person meetings _x000D_
with field staff and had no ability for real-time _x000D_
communication. This paper-based data collection process was a _x000D_
significant contributor to the overall cost increases of the _x000D_
previous Census field operations._x000D_
    We are developing a sophisticated operational control _x000D_
system that will manage tasks and assignments in real time. We _x000D_
intend to send our interviewers out with mobile devices rather _x000D_
than paper and pencil. They will use these devices to collect _x000D_
responses and report their time and attendance instead of using _x000D_
the paper forms as in 2010. And we will have real-time measures _x000D_
of progress._x000D_
    Our goals are to incorporate operational best practices, _x000D_
including the optimization of daily assignments, intelligent _x000D_
routing, and real-time issue management. We are working with _x000D_
the private sector as we build these systems._x000D_
    The four key innovation areas represent significant cost _x000D_
savings that can only be achieved if we get the opportunity to _x000D_
complete significant testing and development in the next 2 _x000D_
years. We have very little time left to test and ultimately _x000D_
important these innovations before we reach 2018, when the cost _x000D_
of the Census will rise. 2018 is also important because we must _x000D_
conduct a complete end-to-end test so we can be confident that _x000D_
when we go live in 2020, all of our systems will work._x000D_
    To realize the most modern decennial census ever, we have _x000D_
to stay on track. That is why next year is crucial to the 2020 _x000D_
Census for the development of the key systems to support the _x000D_
infrastructure to handle data collection and processing._x000D_
    One of the critical activities in 2016 is the continued _x000D_
development of our Census Enterprise system that will support _x000D_
not just the 2020 Census but all of our data collection _x000D_
activities at the Census Bureau. We will no longer build a _x000D_
system that we will throw away after the decennial, as we have _x000D_
for each previous Census. Known as the Census Enterprise Data _x000D_
Collection and Processing (CEDCaP) program, we are moving to a _x000D_
smarter, more cost-efficient, enterprise-level strategy to _x000D_
manage core information technology aspects for all of our _x000D_
Censuses and surveys._x000D_
    At the core of this modern system that we are building is _x000D_
our continued commitment to protecting privacy and _x000D_
confidentiality of individuals' information. Confidentiality _x000D_
and privacy is the very core of the Census Bureau's mission and _x000D_
deeply ingrained in our culture. We protect the information the _x000D_
public provides with a robust, comprehensive, and layered _x000D_
cybersecurity system. We are actively engaged with the National _x000D_
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department _x000D_
of Homeland Security on these efforts._x000D_
    From the Census Enterprise system and cybersecurity to each _x000D_
test, each activity plays a significant role helping the Census _x000D_
Bureau design an accurate and cost-effective 2020 Census. _x000D_
Scaling up to the decennial census is complex, ranging over _x000D_
many years and many operations, which must be synchronized to _x000D_
meet our ultimate mandate. The $5 billion in savings cannot be _x000D_
achieved without rigorous testing designed to inform _x000D_
development of the systems and operations. We need your support _x000D_
to achieve these goals._x000D_
    Thank you, and I hope this update has been informative, and _x000D_
I look forward to answering your questions."

         ISSUES, U."
2924951,2924950,2924952,19238,1,"    Thank you, Senator Lankford. I would like _x000D_
to thank you and Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper for _x000D_
the opportunity to be here this afternoon to discuss the Census _x000D_
Bureau's progress in developing a more cost-effective approach _x000D_
to counting the Nation's population._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Goldenkoff and Ms. Cha _x000D_
appears in the Appendix on page 45._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As you know, this month the Bureau marked the midway point _x000D_
in the decade-long countdown to Census Day 2020, giving greater _x000D_
urgency and importance to the testing, operational, and _x000D_
procurement decisions that it will make in the months ahead. _x000D_
For example, this September, the Bureau plans to announce its _x000D_
preliminary design for the 2020 Census, and two key field tests _x000D_
to inform that decision are currently underway._x000D_
    The cost of the decennial census has continually increased _x000D_
during the past 40 years, in part because the Nation's _x000D_
population has grown steadily larger, more diverse, and _x000D_
increasingly difficult to enumerate. At about $13 billion, the _x000D_
2010 Census was the costliest U.S. Census in history and was 56 _x000D_
percent more expensive than the $8.1 billion spent on the 2000 _x000D_
Census in constant 2010 dollars._x000D_
    In my remarks today, I will discuss the Bureau's progress _x000D_
in implementing four critical cost-savings initiatives and _x000D_
their associated challenges. The four areas include: using data _x000D_
previously provided to the government to help enumerate the _x000D_
population; new processes for updating the Bureau's address _x000D_
list and maps; reengineering field operations; and maximizing _x000D_
self-response._x000D_
    As the Director said, combined, the Bureau estimates that _x000D_
these efforts could generate up to $5 billion in cost savings _x000D_
and enable the Bureau to conduct the 2020 Census at a total _x000D_
life-cycle cost of around $12.7 billion, or about the same as _x000D_
the 2020 head count._x000D_
    With respect to using data previously provided to the _x000D_
government, the Bureau estimates that this initiative, _x000D_
sometimes referred to as ``using administrative records,'' _x000D_
could save as much as $1.2 billion by reducing the need for _x000D_
costly, labor-intensive follow-up work with non-responding _x000D_
households._x000D_
    The Bureau is testing the extent to which it can use _x000D_
Federal data such as Social Security and Medicare records as _x000D_
well as records from State, local, and tribal governments and _x000D_
commercial sources to reduce the number of in-person visits, _x000D_
local Census offices, and operations needed to ensure a _x000D_
complete count._x000D_
    However, before it will be able to realize cost savings or _x000D_
improvements in data reliability from the use of these records, _x000D_
the Bureau will first need to address such questions as the _x000D_
quality of the records and whether they will meet the Bureau's _x000D_
needs. For example, while race and ethnicity data are collected _x000D_
in the Census, certain records available to the Bureau do not _x000D_
include this information._x000D_
    To reduce the cost of its efforts to update its address _x000D_
list and maps by as much as $1 billion, the Bureau is testing _x000D_
whether it can rely mainly on data from government agencies at _x000D_
all levels to share and continuously update their address list _x000D_
and street data with the Bureau._x000D_
    In prior decennials, thousands of Bureau field staff walked _x000D_
almost every street in the Nation as one of several operations _x000D_
to update the Bureau's address list. Key questions here include _x000D_
which map and address data sources are the most cost-effective _x000D_
and whether the Bureau can accurately target its address _x000D_
canvassing efforts._x000D_
    With respect to improving the management of its field _x000D_
operations, the Bureau is examining, among other things, how _x000D_
best to automate enumerators' work, which could save an _x000D_
estimated $2.3 billion. However, the Bureau must first resolve _x000D_
whether it can fully test all the systems and procedures in _x000D_
time for 2020._x000D_
    A fourth cost-saving area involves maximizing self-response _x000D_
through enhanced outreach and an Internet response option. This _x000D_
effort could reduce the need for enumerators to visit non-_x000D_
responding households and save around $500 million. However, _x000D_
among other issues, the Bureau has yet to establish reliable _x000D_
estimates of how much it will cost to deliver an Internet _x000D_
response option and does not have integrated schedules for _x000D_
completing the work._x000D_
    The Bureau has identified or acknowledged many of the _x000D_
challenges and questions associated with these four initiatives _x000D_
and is working to address them. Because of their interrelated _x000D_
nature, shortcomings in any one area could impact the success _x000D_
of the others and thus put estimated cost savings and the _x000D_
accuracy of the count at risk._x000D_
    Going forward, it will be important to ensure the research _x000D_
and testing for these initiatives continue as planned to inform _x000D_
key design decisions later this year._x000D_
    This concludes my prepared remarks, and I will be happy to _x000D_
answer any questions that you may have."

     TESTIMONY OF CAROL R. CHA,\1\ DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION _x000D_
   TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT ISSUES, U."
2924953,2924952,2924954,19238,1,"    I would like to express my thanks to you, Senator _x000D_
Lankford, to Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and _x000D_
Members of the Committee for inviting me to testify today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Ms. Cha and Mr. Goldenkoff _x000D_
appears in the Appendix on page 45._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    IT implementation will be a key factor in whether the _x000D_
Bureau will be able to adequately contain the costs for 2020. _x000D_
The Bureau's past efforts have not always gone well. Our work _x000D_
on the 2010 Census highlighted the mismanagement and major _x000D_
cost, schedule, and performance issues associated with several _x000D_
critical IT investments, one of which was intended as a cost-_x000D_
savings measure but instead increased the costs of the Census _x000D_
by up to $3 billion._x000D_
    For 2020, the Bureau will rely on an enterprisewide IT _x000D_
initiative called ``CEDCaP'' to deliver the systems and IT _x000D_
infrastructure needed to carry out its cost-savings _x000D_
initiatives._x000D_
    For example, CEDCaP is planning to deliver the online _x000D_
survey instrument and a cloud computing solution to support an _x000D_
Internet response option. For field reengineering, the program _x000D_
is planning to implement a new system to track and manage field _x000D_
work. It will also test the use of mobile devices, either _x000D_
government-issued or employee-owned, for field data collection._x000D_
    Recent estimates put the program's cost at about $548 _x000D_
million through 2020. Given the Bureau's prior and existing _x000D_
challenges, we highlighted CEDCaP as part of a new entry onto _x000D_
this year's GAO high-risk list as one of a handful of major IT _x000D_
investments in need of the most attention, and we plan to _x000D_
initiate an in-depth review for this Committee later this year _x000D_
on CEDCaP._x000D_
    Based on our work to date, I would like to highlight two _x000D_
key challenges this afternoon regarding the Bureau's IT plans _x000D_
for 2020._x000D_
    First, the time constraints. September's decision is _x000D_
expected to drive the business requirements for CEDCaP's _x000D_
systems and infrastructure. This milestone, which has already _x000D_
been delayed by a year, cannot afford to slip further. However, _x000D_
as we reported earlier this year, the Bureau had not yet _x000D_
addressed how two critical inputs into this decision would be _x000D_
addressed. These inputs relate to the Internet self-response _x000D_
rate and the IT infrastructure security and scalability needs. _x000D_
And if they are not adequately addressed by September, it could _x000D_
lead to system rework downstream, eating into an already narrow _x000D_
schedule margin._x000D_
    By October 2018, the Bureau intends to begin end-to-end _x000D_
testing to validate that CEDCaP's systems are ready to go live _x000D_
on Census Day. This gives the Bureau roughly 3\1/2\ years to _x000D_
develop and integrate planned systems, which may seem like a _x000D_
lot of time but is not based on past performance, and a lack of _x000D_
experience implementing technologies at the scale of the 2020._x000D_
    The October 2018 milestone date is a prudent one for _x000D_
planning purposes. If this date slips to the right and system _x000D_
testing is compressed, then we very well could have another _x000D_
HealthCare.gov on our hands._x000D_
    In order to decrease the risk of system rework downstream _x000D_
and protect the October testing date, the Bureau should fully _x000D_
implement the recommendations we made to ensure that this _x000D_
September's decision will be adequately informed._x000D_
    The second key challenge is the Bureau's current IT _x000D_
posture. The Bureau has made important progress to strengthen _x000D_
and institutionalize IT governance and requirements management, _x000D_
and as a result, the Bureau is better positioned to manage and _x000D_
oversee its IT investments than in prior decennials. However, _x000D_
more work is needed to address critical IT workforce gaps and _x000D_
information security deficiencies._x000D_
    In particular, the Bureau does not have the requisite _x000D_
competencies in enough numbers to meet IT workforce needs. _x000D_
These skills gaps include systems engineering, IT security, _x000D_
cloud computing, and Internet data collection, to name a few._x000D_
    To the Bureau's credit, it is aggressively working to close _x000D_
these gaps. However, if they do remain open, the Bureau's _x000D_
ability to deliver CEDCaP effectively will be hampered._x000D_
    In addition, the Bureau does not yet have a comprehensive _x000D_
information security program, something we first reported on in _x000D_
January 2013. Among other things, the Bureau had not _x000D_
effectively implemented appropriate access controls to protect _x000D_
its systems from intrusion. For example, the Bureau did not _x000D_
adequately encrypt Title 13 data in transmission and at rest, _x000D_
nor did it use secure protocols to manage its IT _x000D_
infrastructure, which placed sensitive data such as _x000D_
administrative user accounts and passwords at risk of _x000D_
compromise. As a result, we made 115 recommendations to address _x000D_
these control deficiencies. As of today, the Bureau has fully _x000D_
addressed 19 of them._x000D_
    Given that the Bureau is considering using IT systems to _x000D_
collect the public's personal information in ways that have not _x000D_
been used in the prior decennial, implementing our security _x000D_
recommendations must be a high priority._x000D_
    In summary, while the Bureau is in a stronger position to _x000D_
manage its IT investments than in the 2010 Census, it is also _x000D_
starting development work much later in the decade. The margin _x000D_
for error is slim. And the current workforce and information _x000D_
security gaps add significant risk to the 2020 Census. Moving _x000D_
forward, swift actions to fully implement our open _x000D_
recommendations must be taken. Doing so will improve the _x000D_
Bureau's ability to deliver on its IT plans and realize cost _x000D_
savings._x000D_
    That concludes my statement, and I look forward to _x000D_
addressing your questions."
2924954,2924953,2924955,19238,1,"    Thank you, all of you._x000D_
    And as promised, Senator Carper is here and will give an _x000D_
opening statement."
2924955,2924954,2924956,19238,1,"    Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. What I would _x000D_
really like to do is get right into the questions. It is nice _x000D_
of you to yield to me._x000D_
    I would say that I would like to ask that my statement be _x000D_
made part of the record,\1\ unless one of my colleagues _x000D_
objects._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Carper appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 35._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2924956,2924955,2924957,19238,1,    Without objection.
2924957,2924956,2924958,19238,1,"    All right. Good._x000D_
    Just very briefly, we have been doing this for 200-and-some _x000D_
years--not us here. We have not been in the Senate that long. _x000D_
But we have had Senators interested in trying to get a good _x000D_
Census and trying to do it in a cost-effective way._x000D_
    A lot of people think that we in Washington cannot organize _x000D_
and run a good three-car funeral procession. And we have a _x000D_
great opportunity here to demonstrate, by careful planning, _x000D_
smart funding, good oversight, that we can do some amazing _x000D_
things with the technology and the tools and the people that we _x000D_
have. It is just really imperative that we deliver. And this _x000D_
oversight hearing today is in part designed to make sure that _x000D_
you can deliver and that we will be proud of the work that is _x000D_
done in the next 5 years._x000D_
    Thank you."
2924958,2924957,2924959,19238,1,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Let me address just a few questions, and then we will _x000D_
continue moving through questions here on the dais as people _x000D_
arrived._x000D_
    Mr. Thompson, you had mentioned that there are some things _x000D_
you need to talk to Congress about, about vacant units. Is _x000D_
there something you are needing from Congress directly, _x000D_
clarification or statutory changes?"
2924959,2924958,2924960,19238,1,"    Thank you, Senator. There is, but let me _x000D_
clarify my statement first. So in collecting the information _x000D_
from our non-responding households to the Census, we are _x000D_
testing ways in which we can use administrative records to _x000D_
enumerate occupied housing units instead of direct in-person _x000D_
enumeration. And we want to make sure that we are on the same _x000D_
page as the Congress in terms of taking this step, if we should _x000D_
propose to take this step._x000D_
    Now, with regard to help from the Congress, there is a data _x000D_
set--it is called the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH)--_x000D_
and it is maintained at the Department of Health and Human _x000D_
Services (HHS), and it would help us greatly in our program, _x000D_
and we would need some legislative changes to have access to _x000D_
that file."
2924960,2924959,2924961,19238,1,"    OK. What other data do you need here? _x000D_
Obviously there are multiple different databases between the _x000D_
IRS, Social Security, Department of Labor (DOL); HHS has it, _x000D_
you have it. There are lots of data sets around there. I guess _x000D_
the question for me initially would be: Which particular data _x000D_
sets do you want to be able to use? And, second, are any of _x000D_
these agencies charging Commerce to be able to have access to _x000D_
that data?"
2924961,2924960,2924962,19238,1,"    Thank you. So you have named some of the data _x000D_
sets that we already have access to. We are also in the process _x000D_
of acquiring the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program _x000D_
(SNAP) records State by State and the Women, Infants, and _x000D_
Children (WIC) program records so we can put these together in _x000D_
a very private way, protecting privacy, and using them and _x000D_
research them as we proceed with the Census._x000D_
    We are not being charged by the other agencies for these _x000D_
data sets. In fact, the Secretary of Commerce has great _x000D_
authority to ask for these records in conducting the job of _x000D_
carrying out the Census."
2924962,2924961,2924963,19238,1,"    OK. We had an extensive conversation here _x000D_
at this same Committee room just a couple of weeks ago about _x000D_
the Death Master File (DMF), and that we have about 6.5 million _x000D_
people that are listed in our systems right now that are over _x000D_
114 years old, I believe--112? Excuse me. A lot younger than _x000D_
that, 112 years old, when we actually think there are less than _x000D_
two dozen in the United States. So we have some problems in _x000D_
those data sets that are out there. How are you going to try to _x000D_
address that to make sure we do not get individuals into the _x000D_
system that are not really alive anymore?"
2924963,2924962,2924964,19238,1,"    Part of our research program, is to look at _x000D_
which records can be effective and in which combinations of _x000D_
records that link together. So we do need to do an extensive _x000D_
research program to feel comfortable before we use _x000D_
administrative records. And we are looking at those very things _x000D_
right now."
2924964,2924963,2924965,19238,1,"    OK. That is one of the aspects that we _x000D_
will need to resolve, both how that is resolved within Census _x000D_
and then obviously we would like to know that information so we _x000D_
can get a chance to share that with other entities within the _x000D_
Federal Government, because as I mentioned, with the Death _x000D_
Master File, that has extensive millions of names on it that _x000D_
are no longer with us anymore. We have to be able to resolve _x000D_
that._x000D_
    Mr. Goldenkoff, you have a very interesting statement, _x000D_
which I have read and seen multiple times before. If we can put _x000D_
all of these different aspects into place, all these different _x000D_
innovations, we could save $5 billion. And so by saving $5 _x000D_
billion, we would spend the same as we did last time._x000D_
    Now, if I sold you a pizza for $10 and said I am going to _x000D_
sell you the next one for--I am going to save $5 for you, and _x000D_
it is going to be the same cost, I am not sure you would think _x000D_
that was a savings. So I am working through the math here _x000D_
between how we save $5 billion, yet we do it for the same cost _x000D_
as we did last time."
2924965,2924964,2924966,19238,1,"    Well, part of it is a unit cost, roughly _x000D_
$100 per housing unit. So you would expect to see some cost _x000D_
increase because the population----"
2924966,2924965,2924967,19238,1,"    Right, because of the number of people."
2924967,2924966,2924968,19238,1,"    Exactly. The workload is more. So that is _x000D_
why we look at the unit cost, and it works out roughly the _x000D_
same, about $100 per housing unit."
2924968,2924967,2924969,19238,1,"    Is there a way to be able to save unit _x000D_
cost, that the unit cost goes down? Or are we tapped out? I _x000D_
think it is $97, the last stat that I saw, per person to be _x000D_
able to do this. Is there a way to be able to save money per _x000D_
unit cost rather than saying we had a growing population, we _x000D_
assume it still costs $97 per person to do this."
2924969,2924968,2924970,19238,1,"    Well, there is always a cost-quality _x000D_
tradeoff. You can always conduct a count for less. The question _x000D_
is: How accurate is it going to be? And that is always--that _x000D_
has to be weighed. I mean, the Constitution requires that _x000D_
everybody be counted, and so that is the gold standard. And so _x000D_
because of the increasing complexities of counting everybody, _x000D_
the cost goes up from Census to Census. The Census Bureau needs _x000D_
to work harder each decade just to stay in place."
2924970,2924969,2924971,19238,1,"    So going back to something Ms. Cha _x000D_
mentioned before, in 2010 we had a $3 billion process of _x000D_
innovation that came through. I think that was dealing with the _x000D_
handhelds--is that correct?--is what it circled around."
2924971,2924970,2924972,19238,1,    That is correct.
2924972,2924971,2924973,19238,1,"    So a $3 billion cost. A $13 billion _x000D_
program really cost $10 billion because we had a $3 billion _x000D_
program that ended up not being fully implemented and we lost _x000D_
there. So what I am trying to figure out is we save $5 billion, _x000D_
however we are still at basically the same cost as we did last _x000D_
time per person, and we had a $3 billion failure last time."
2924973,2924972,2924974,19238,1,"    That is correct. And I also need to say _x000D_
that, GAO has not verified these cost estimates, so we are _x000D_
relying for now on the Bureau's estimates. We will probably be _x000D_
doing work in the future where we will look into the validity _x000D_
of those estimates."
2924974,2924973,2924975,19238,1,"    Is there a difference in the American _x000D_
Community Survey and the cost per person in that piece versus _x000D_
the every-10-year-Census piece, cost per person?"
2924975,2924974,2924976,19238,1,    I do not have that information.
2924976,2924975,2924977,19238,1,"    Mr. Thompson, do you happen to know that _x000D_
number, cost per person, the American Community Survey that we _x000D_
do every quarter basically?"
2924977,2924976,2924978,19238,1,    I am sorry. I do not have that figure.
2924978,2924977,2924979,19238,1,"    Do you think it is higher or lower? Just _x000D_
a ballpark on that."
2924979,2924978,2924980,19238,1,"    I think it is probably higher for the _x000D_
American Community Survey, somewhat."
2924980,2924979,2924981,19238,1,"    OK. I am going to keep going on _x000D_
questions, and I will come around for a second round here in _x000D_
just a moment. I will recognize Senator Carper, the Ranking _x000D_
Member, for the next set of questions."
2924981,2924980,2924982,19238,1,"    Why don't I just go last? I would like to _x000D_
hear the others."
2924982,2924981,2924983,19238,1,    OK.
2924983,2924982,2924984,19238,1,"    Then I will just come in at the end. Thank _x000D_
you."
2924984,2924983,2924985,19238,1,"    Senator Ayotte, you came in next after _x000D_
that."
2924985,2924984,2924986,19238,1,"    Thank you. Thank you all for being here._x000D_
    Here is what I wanted to understand. I know that you have _x000D_
taken steps to use commercial mapping information in putting _x000D_
together the proposal for the upcoming Census. And as I _x000D_
understand it, you are using portions of that commercial data _x000D_
to fill in gaps, but you still would be creating essentially _x000D_
your own product of the map that you need for this. What I _x000D_
wanted to understand is why we do not further use the _x000D_
commercial products that may be available. Why is the Request _x000D_
for Proposal (RFP) limited to filling in gaps rather than _x000D_
relying more heavily on commercial, already existing products _x000D_
where they already have? I know that their products may not be _x000D_
able to fully do this, but could do a significant amount of it. _x000D_
So what is the thinking there?"
2924986,2924985,2924987,19238,1,"    Well, thank you, Senator. We have been _x000D_
talking with a number of the companies in that field. We have _x000D_
an RFP, as you noticed."
2924987,2924986,2924988,19238,1,    Right.
2924988,2924987,2924989,19238,1,"    We want to evaluate the quality of the _x000D_
materials that are available in the private sector and where _x000D_
they will work and save us from walking the ground where we _x000D_
intend to use them._x000D_
    We also will be having another RFP coming out soon which is _x000D_
going to be asking the private sector for services such as _x000D_
automated change detection and the like._x000D_
    So we are looking forward to seeing the responses to the _x000D_
RFP, and we are looking forward to using commercial data where _x000D_
it is available."
2924989,2924988,2924990,19238,1,"    So couldn't commercial data be used in a _x000D_
much broader capacity than what your current RFP suggests?"
2924990,2924989,2924991,19238,1,"    I did not think that we were trying to limit _x000D_
the commercial data through the RFP process."
2924991,2924990,2924992,19238,1,"    So are you open to--for example, if _x000D_
commercial data for mapping would get you--I am just using a _x000D_
number--90 percent there and you had to fill in the rest to _x000D_
complete your product, are you open to doing that?"
2924992,2924991,2924993,19238,1,    Yes.
2924993,2924992,2924994,19238,1,    OK.
2924994,2924993,2924995,19238,1,    Yes.
2924995,2924994,2924996,19238,1,"    It seems to me, I mean, so many of us use _x000D_
this data in so many capacities, and so always re-creating the _x000D_
wheel, this is a place where I know you are already taking _x000D_
important steps to do this, but we could save a lot of money _x000D_
for the public."
2924996,2924995,2924997,19238,1,    Yes.
2924997,2924996,2924998,19238,1,"    I wanted to follow-up on some of the GAO _x000D_
findings. What are the issues that you are going to be able _x000D_
to--one of the big things, I think, that overlies all of this _x000D_
is transparency in costs and measuring and achieving savings. _x000D_
How do you think that you will meet the transparency goals so _x000D_
that we can actually understand how much we are paying for _x000D_
things in a much more open way so that when we have our _x000D_
oversight function we do not end up in a position where we are _x000D_
not having the right type of oversight?"
2924998,2924997,2924999,19238,1,"    Well, thank you. We are committed for this _x000D_
Census and the 2020 cycle to being very open and transparent _x000D_
with our methods. I think we have a good relationship with the _x000D_
GAO. We certainly hope that they will--and we know they will--_x000D_
look carefully at what we are doing._x000D_
    I should also note that once a quarter we have a project _x000D_
management review in a public way for the 2020 program, and we _x000D_
webcast it. We make it available and we want everyone to see _x000D_
how we are planning and what we are doing, and we are trying to _x000D_
be very transparent with that."
2924999,2924998,2925000,19238,1,"    So, Ms. Cha, thank you for your testimony, _x000D_
and I think it is an eye opener for all of us when we hear _x000D_
potential analogies to HealthCare.gov, because obviously we all _x000D_
got an earful from our constituents and others over that _x000D_
rollout._x000D_
    What are the most significant steps that we could take in _x000D_
this Committee to make sure that, in fact, this IT procurement _x000D_
goes properly? One of the issues that we have I think overall _x000D_
in the government--it is not just unique to this. We are _x000D_
particularly bad at this. Throughout the government we have had _x000D_
numerous occasions where we have invested a lot in a particular _x000D_
system, and we have not ended up with the system that we hoped _x000D_
for or the costs went way over. So I just wanted to hear from _x000D_
your perspective. If you were sitting in our shoes, what would _x000D_
you think that we should do most to make sure that the warnings _x000D_
that you have given us do not occur?"
2925000,2924999,2925001,19238,1,"    Well, Senator, your continued and sustained _x000D_
oversight of the 2020 Census and particularly the CEDCaP _x000D_
program will be vital. These large and complex IT modernization _x000D_
programs are challenging, and it is one of the reasons why we _x000D_
cited CEDCaP as part of a new GAO high-risk entry this year in _x000D_
terms of improving IT management governmentwide. These programs _x000D_
rarely meet cost schedule and performance goals, and we have an _x000D_
opportunity here. The train has not left the station. And so, _x000D_
when we look at CEDCaP and we look at the complexity and the _x000D_
risks associated with this program and you layer on top of that _x000D_
the key challenges that I identified in terms of the time _x000D_
constraints as well as the risks associated with the IT _x000D_
workforce gap and the information security control _x000D_
deficiencies, there is quite a bit of risk here. I think there _x000D_
is an imbalance._x000D_
    And so to the extent that that the Bureau can focus on _x000D_
implementing a simpler solution, that would, I think, set the _x000D_
Bureau up for success relative to IT."
2925001,2925000,2925002,19238,1,"    So as I see it, I hear you saying that the _x000D_
solution they are proposing may be too complex to achieve _x000D_
during this period with the workforce that they have."
2925002,2925001,2925003,19238,1,    That is correct.
2925003,2925002,2925004,19238,1,"    And is there anything more we should be _x000D_
doing also on the workforce gap issue? Which, frankly, is _x000D_
something that we face across government agencies, because this _x000D_
is a highly competitive field."
2925004,2925003,2925005,19238,1,"    Well, again, it is that continued monitoring on _x000D_
your end. I do want to say that the Bureau is aggressively _x000D_
looking to close these gaps that they do have. However, if _x000D_
these gaps are not effectively closed, then I think the Bureau _x000D_
needs to, again, continue to identify ways to decrease the _x000D_
complexity of the CEDCaP initiative."
2925005,2925004,2925006,19238,1,"    So my timing is up, but I would like to _x000D_
hear what your response would be to that about making this a _x000D_
simpler process so it could be easier to achieve."
2925006,2925005,2925007,19238,1,"    Certainly, Senator. So I think I would coin a _x000D_
phrase from our Chief Information Officer (CIO), and it is _x000D_
something that worked very successfully in the 2000 Census when _x000D_
we did deliver our systems on time and on schedule, and that _x000D_
is, we are innovating but we are not inventing. So our plan is _x000D_
to use existing technology and existing expertise and innovate _x000D_
by using that intelligently._x000D_
    So, for example, we are going to be using a smartphone, but _x000D_
the smartphone already exists. We are not going to invent one _x000D_
like we tried to invent a handheld the last time._x000D_
    We are using optimized systems for our routing, but we are _x000D_
not building--those systems already exist, and a number of _x000D_
people have very good ones, including the United Parcel Service _x000D_
(UPS). So we are trying to take advantage of what is existing _x000D_
and not trying to invent new things."
2925007,2925006,2925008,19238,1,    Thank you.
2925008,2925007,2925009,19238,1,    Senator Peters.
2925009,2925008,2925010,19238,1,"    Thank you for being here and for your _x000D_
testimony. As Senator Carper mentioned, it is important to get _x000D_
this right, and certainly it is a monumental undertaking to be _x000D_
able to count every individual in this country, and this is not _x000D_
an easy task. I appreciate that. But it is a very important _x000D_
task that you undertake, particularly from a public policy _x000D_
standpoint, so that we can make sure folks are protected, have _x000D_
resources, allocations that are done properly, so my hat goes _x000D_
off to you._x000D_
    I represent an area in Michigan, however, that has a very _x000D_
large population of folks from the Middle East and from North _x000D_
Africa. Mr. Thompson, I sent a letter to you earlier this year _x000D_
with a couple of my colleagues talking about that issue and the _x000D_
fact that that classification is not part of the Census. And as _x000D_
you know, it can be problematic because if you are not on the _x000D_
Census, you do not have access to some voting rights _x000D_
protections, including access to ballots in your home language _x000D_
to be able to vote and exercise that right. Also, it is _x000D_
difficult for researchers if we do not have that type of Census _x000D_
information to understand potential health disparities that may _x000D_
exist in the Middle Eastern population in Michigan and other _x000D_
places around the country, as well as employment discrimination _x000D_
and a whole host of things that we need to look into, and this _x000D_
would provide accurate data._x000D_
    My understanding is that you are going to test that _x000D_
category for Middle Eastern descent as well as North African. I _x000D_
appreciate your prompt response to our letter a ways back, but _x000D_
I want to take this opportunity to get an update from you as to _x000D_
where you are. I know when you responded to my letter, you _x000D_
mentioned you were going to be reaching out to stakeholders in _x000D_
the spring and consulting with community leaders within that _x000D_
community to get some assessment as to how you would proceed. _x000D_
Could you give me an update, please, on where we stand on that _x000D_
and how you look to proceed?"
2925010,2925009,2925011,19238,1,"    Certainly. So we have been having ongoing _x000D_
discussions with various members of the Middle Eastern and _x000D_
North African community, and we are testing including that _x000D_
categorization as part of our race and ethnic questions, and _x000D_
that test will take place this fall._x000D_
    We are looking forward to having an expert meeting of _x000D_
various Middle Eastern and North African scholars this spring _x000D_
so that we can really come up with a definition, if you will, _x000D_
of Middle Eastern and North African that everyone agrees to so _x000D_
we can use that as part of how we explain it when we conduct _x000D_
the Census. So we are on track."
2925011,2925010,2925012,19238,1,"    Well, that is good to hear. I appreciate _x000D_
that._x000D_
    Have you heard from any other Americans or other _x000D_
organizations about a lack of representation in the Census? Is _x000D_
this unique to Middle Eastern community, or are there others _x000D_
that you are working on?"
2925012,2925011,2925013,19238,1,    In terms of the----
2925013,2925012,2925014,19238,1,    Classification.
2925014,2925013,2925015,19238,1,"    Classification of Middle Eastern and North _x000D_
African. We have heard from other constituents on other aspects _x000D_
of the question, but for inclusion, it has been basically the _x000D_
Middle Eastern and North African."
2925015,2925014,2925016,19238,1,"    So that is where your focus is, it is going _x000D_
to be on this going forward?"
2925016,2925015,2925017,19238,1,    Yes.
2925017,2925016,2925018,19238,1,"    Great. I have many constituents, as you can _x000D_
imagine, given the large size of our community in Michigan, _x000D_
that are very passionate about this, and I understand that you _x000D_
have received thousands of inquiries from the community. Have _x000D_
you been responding directly? Or how can I respond to my _x000D_
constituents as to how you are listening to them and the _x000D_
response that they will receive?"
2925018,2925017,2925019,19238,1,"    I think what you are referring to is a _x000D_
Federal Register notice we put out that announced our plans for _x000D_
this fall test, and we received well over a thousand _x000D_
recommendations that we include in that test the Middle Eastern _x000D_
and North African category. And we are responding by a comment _x000D_
to the Federal Register notice to those recommendations that we _x000D_
got."
2925019,2925018,2925020,19238,1,    OK.
2925020,2925019,2925021,19238,1,"    Now, we will group them together because many _x000D_
recommendations said the same thing."
2925021,2925020,2925022,19238,1,"    Right. So you will be summarizing that in _x000D_
the Register."
2925022,2925021,2925023,19238,1,    Yes.
2925023,2925022,2925024,19238,1,"    And the folks we could refer them to that _x000D_
as well as get back----"
2925024,2925023,2925025,19238,1,    Yes.
2925025,2925024,2925026,19238,1,"    Well, I appreciate that. The other issue _x000D_
that I am concerned about deals with the homeless population. I _x000D_
know you are reaching out to folks who are not going to be at _x000D_
an address to count to make sure that they are represented. In _x000D_
fact, in Michigan, Washtenaw County is one of 71 communities _x000D_
that participates in Zero: 2016, which is a campaign to end _x000D_
veteran and chronic homelessness. And as a result of a recent _x000D_
survey that they did, they did show a 24-percent decline in the _x000D_
number of people living on the streets and in shelters, which _x000D_
is a good thing. But I am particularly concerned, as they are, _x000D_
with homeless veterans who may be out there, who have the _x000D_
ability and certainly the right to access benefits, but may not _x000D_
be aware of it._x000D_
    It seems to me having Census workers out finding people who _x000D_
are living on the street--and you have the staffing to do _x000D_
that--presents an opportunity, first, to identify those _x000D_
individuals, but also, two, present them with information that _x000D_
may be helpful to get them to a place where they can get the _x000D_
services that they have earned and they deserve._x000D_
    Could you talk a little bit about how you reach out to _x000D_
folks who are homeless living on the streets and if you would _x000D_
be in a position to help in our efforts to bring these folks _x000D_
out of the shadows and into the help that they deserve and _x000D_
need?"
2925026,2925025,2925027,19238,1,"    Senator, getting an accurate count of all _x000D_
Americans is our primary goal for 2020. We are right now at _x000D_
this point in the process of starting to look at how we will _x000D_
blend in operations on top of our automation and reengineering _x000D_
to count these populations. So, for example,_x000D_
    I have a National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and _x000D_
Other Populations, and we are starting a working group on that _x000D_
committee right now to start addressing these issues._x000D_
    We want to address these issues over the years ahead, but _x000D_
right now I do not have a proposal for how we are going to _x000D_
count the homeless and the veterans in 2020. But we do intend _x000D_
to have a plan for that, and we will share it widely."
2925027,2925026,2925028,19238,1,    When do you expect to have that plan?
2925028,2925027,2925029,19238,1,"    I would have to get back to you. I would say _x000D_
by the end of next year we should have some significant _x000D_
progress on that."
2925029,2925028,2925030,19238,1,"    Well, I would appreciate that, and if you _x000D_
could inform our office about that, I would appreciate that. _x000D_
And then the second step is that when we identify these _x000D_
individuals, it also is an opportunity to make sure that these _x000D_
individuals, particularly homeless veterans, that there are _x000D_
benefits that are available to them and places of refuge for _x000D_
them to go. Although it is a different mission than you have _x000D_
for your Census workers now because of certainly the concern _x000D_
about those who have served our country who may be homeless, _x000D_
this may be an opportunity for us to kind of take a whole-_x000D_
government approach to helping those individuals. I would hope _x000D_
you would be open to that as well."
2925030,2925029,2925031,19238,1,    Of course.
2925031,2925030,2925032,19238,1,    Thank you.
2925032,2925031,2925033,19238,1,"    Mr. Thompson, before I recognize Senator _x000D_
Carper, can I get a clarification? By the end of 2015 or by the _x000D_
end of 2016 you will have the plan for the homeless?"
2925033,2925032,2925034,19238,1,    I was referring to the end of 2016.
2925034,2925033,2925035,19238,1,"    OK. So by the end of 2016, you will be _x000D_
able to have articulated a plan for that, for identifying the _x000D_
homeless and then doing a count there?"
2925035,2925034,2925036,19238,1,    Yes.
2925036,2925035,2925037,19238,1,    Great. Thank you. Senator Carper.
2925037,2925036,2925038,19238,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Mr. Thompson, it is very nice to see you, and Mr. _x000D_
Goldenkoff, Ms. Cha. I love saying your name._x000D_
    This is not your first opportunity to be involved at a _x000D_
senior level for the Census. Is that correct, Mr. Thompson?"
2925038,2925037,2925039,19238,1,"    That is correct, Senator. I was the career _x000D_
person in charge of the 2000 Census."
2925039,2925038,2925040,19238,1,"    OK. Just thinking back on your tenure with _x000D_
the Census Bureau, share with us some of the insights or things _x000D_
you have learned in this tour as our Director that are new and _x000D_
that you did not know before and how might they direct us as we _x000D_
try to get a better result for less money?"
2925040,2925039,2925041,19238,1,"    Well, Senator, you are hitting on the reason _x000D_
that I came back into public service. When I left the _x000D_
government in 2002 and went to the private sector, I had no _x000D_
intention of coming back into government. But I could not _x000D_
foresee just the way that technology had developed and offered _x000D_
a lot of opportunities to do the Census fundamentally _x000D_
differently than we had done it before. And that got me excited _x000D_
to come back into government and help the Census Bureau move _x000D_
forward."
2925041,2925040,2925042,19238,1,"    When you watched back in 2010, or actually _x000D_
the run-up to 2010, when they were trying to develop the _x000D_
handheld, and rather than get something off the shelf, actually _x000D_
develop and build and invent it, as you said, invent it _x000D_
ourselves, what did you think as you watched that unfold?"
2925042,2925041,2925043,19238,1,"    I was very disappointed that that happened, _x000D_
that that event happened. I was fairly close to it. I was on a _x000D_
panel that Secretary Carlos Gutierrez called together to give _x000D_
him a recommendation on how to proceed in the aftermath of the _x000D_
handheld contract issues. I was just disappointed and sorry for _x000D_
the Census Bureau. I wish I could have been there, but I was _x000D_
not."
2925043,2925042,2925044,19238,1,"    My recollection was this is when Dr. Coburn _x000D_
and I were taking turns leading the Subcommittee on Federal _x000D_
Financial Management that had jurisdiction over the Census. And _x000D_
it seems to me we went through a period of time where we had a _x000D_
fair amount of churning in terms of leadership at the Census. _x000D_
Is that correct? I think we had someone who was Acting _x000D_
Director, and then within the span of a couple years, we had _x000D_
maybe a couple of other people who were Acting Directors. We do _x000D_
not have that challenge anymore, do we?"
2925044,2925043,2925045,19238,1,    Not right now.
2925045,2925044,2925046,19238,1,    That is right.
2925046,2925045,2925047,19238,1,    I am delighted to be the Director.
2925047,2925046,2925048,19238,1,"    Because we have a law that actually says _x000D_
that the folks who are appointed in the job serve for 5 years, _x000D_
and the idea is that hopefully we will end up in a situation _x000D_
where we are not going to be in the throes or we are in the _x000D_
face of the Census and all of a sudden have turnover in _x000D_
leadership. My hope is that is going to serve us well._x000D_
    I am a guy who likes to think about incentives, how do we _x000D_
incentivize behavior to get better results, and I am real _x000D_
interested in root causes. We have a lot of people that are not _x000D_
interested in cooperating and being counted and providing _x000D_
information to the Census because of their right to privacy or _x000D_
they do not see any value for taking the time to either respond _x000D_
online or in person if somebody knocks on their door. They do _x000D_
not have an appreciation for the value of the information that _x000D_
we gain from the Census. They do not care how their _x000D_
Congressional districts are apportioned and all that._x000D_
    How do we incentivize people to be better citizens in this _x000D_
process? What are we doing, we collectively, to incentivize _x000D_
people to be better citizens in this regard? It is all great _x000D_
that we have the technology, we provide the money, the _x000D_
oversight, the funding. But how do we incentivize people? _x000D_
Collectively, how do we do that?"
2925048,2925047,2925049,19238,1,"    That is a very good question, Senator. We _x000D_
have started research on that issue already for the 2020 _x000D_
Census. We have a test in the Savannah, Georgia, area, the _x000D_
Savannah, Georgia, media market, and we have already started to _x000D_
test different ways to reach out to the American public to _x000D_
encourage them to respond. And this is just the first in a _x000D_
series of tests, but we are starting this process much earlier _x000D_
than we did in the 2010 Census process."
2925049,2925048,2925050,19238,1,    OK.
2925050,2925049,2925051,19238,1,"    But it is something that we have to conduct _x000D_
some research on because the population has changed. It is not _x000D_
the same population that we had in 2010."
2925051,2925050,2925052,19238,1,"    All right. I agree with you. I thought that _x000D_
was a pretty good question, and I am going to ask you to think _x000D_
about your answer and respond to me on the record, because I _x000D_
think this is a big issue, and most people have not a clue of _x000D_
the value to our country, to their communities, of a Census _x000D_
done well._x000D_
    Let me also ask, one of my many favorite sayings is, ``Pay _x000D_
me now or pay me later.'' And I think that also applies with _x000D_
the President's budget request for 2016, and he is asking in _x000D_
his budget for the Census a bump-up in funding. Explain to us _x000D_
why that relates to pay me now or pay me later."
2925052,2925051,2925053,19238,1,"    Certainly. So the biggest part of the bump-up _x000D_
is to start developing the systems and processes that we will _x000D_
use to take this reengineered Census, and it is a challenge _x000D_
because we have never done a Census this way before. We have _x000D_
never used handheld devices. We have never used the Internet as _x000D_
a self-response option for the Census. We have never used _x000D_
optimized routing. So there are a lot of gains through that. _x000D_
But we really have to do the work in 2016 and 2017 to have in _x000D_
place the system so that we can run a complete end-to-end test _x000D_
in 2018, and that would give us the assurance that we could _x000D_
avoid a bad situation, similar to what happened before."
2925053,2925052,2925054,19238,1,"    OK. I have some more questions, and I will _x000D_
look forward to another round. It will give me a chance to pick _x000D_
on our other two witnesses. Do not go away."
2925054,2925053,2925055,19238,1,"    Thank you. We will open it up for _x000D_
questions here, and we will get a chance to go through as much _x000D_
as we can._x000D_
    Mr. Thompson, you had made a comment about identifiers and _x000D_
the Internet, as far as being able to follow-up. Can you _x000D_
complete that thought as well? If individuals go on to the _x000D_
Internet and they actually do their information, will they have _x000D_
an identifier there that is consistent so we will know who that _x000D_
was and have the consistency of that, as we would with a paper _x000D_
form?"
2925055,2925054,2925056,19238,1,"    Thank you, Senator. So let me be clear. What _x000D_
we are testing is in every Census to date, most of the _x000D_
enumeration required that an individual have either a Census _x000D_
questionnaire or an ID number that linked them to an address. _x000D_
What we are testing now is letting people respond with their _x000D_
address alone, and that has two issues that we have to feel _x000D_
comfortable with before we do it. One issue is we have to be _x000D_
able to validate their response as accurate. And the other _x000D_
issue is we know that in the past even we have had more than _x000D_
one response for the same address. And so we are going to have _x000D_
to be able to unduplicate the responses that we get. These are _x000D_
some challenging problems. We are working with experts in the _x000D_
field, including the National Institute of Standards and _x000D_
Technology, the MITRE Corporation, and some others._x000D_
    So we are taking this very seriously, and we need to be _x000D_
convinced that it will work. But if we can make it work, it _x000D_
does give us the opportunity to allow people to be counted when _x000D_
we reach them with a message if they do not have their _x000D_
questionnaire. So we think that the opportunity there is worth _x000D_
trying to do that. But as I said, we are testing it. We are _x000D_
going to have the results of our testing, and we are only going _x000D_
to implement it if we feel comfortable."
2925056,2925055,2925057,19238,1,"    So the assumption is that we would have a _x000D_
master list of every address in the United States, and if they _x000D_
pull up that particular address, they could fill out the _x000D_
information for that address, not that they are creating an _x000D_
address in the system. So there is some sort of verification _x000D_
even at the beginning if they are typing in an identifying _x000D_
address that we do not recognize as a real address."
2925057,2925056,2925058,19238,1,    Yes.
2925058,2925057,2925059,19238,1,"    OK. Ms. Cha, questions and thoughts about _x000D_
that? What are the risks involved?"
2925059,2925058,2925060,19238,1,"    Well, in addition to the address verification, _x000D_
there is also the identity verification as well. So I just _x000D_
wanted to kind of round out that piece, these two key elements._x000D_
    On the former, it seems to be much more simple from a _x000D_
technology perspective to match the address that a respondent _x000D_
enters into the form and match that against the Master Address _x000D_
File (MAF). However, the concern that we have here is that it _x000D_
is unclear as to whether the Bureau knows exactly what it needs _x000D_
to know in time for its September 2015 decision. Again, that _x000D_
milestone decision is going to--it is intended to deliver the _x000D_
complete set of business requirements for the systems _x000D_
development piece._x000D_
    So if there is information regarding non-ID processing that _x000D_
is not contained in that decision, then ultimately it could _x000D_
lead to system rework downstream. So that is the primary _x000D_
concern that we have with regard to non-ID processing, just _x000D_
that the Bureau is--we are in year 5 at this time, and if _x000D_
continued testing in this area proceeds beyond September 2015, _x000D_
it will impact the systems that they are expecting to deliver _x000D_
and to deploy."
2925060,2925059,2925061,19238,1,"    Right. And you made extensive comments _x000D_
about cybersecurity issues and vulnerabilities. Your statement, _x000D_
if I remember correctly, access controls, you have 115 _x000D_
recommendations of which 19 have actually been responded to at _x000D_
this point."
2925061,2925060,2925062,19238,1,    That is correct.
2925062,2925061,2925063,19238,1,"    So what does that mean as far as your _x000D_
perception? At this point you would expect 115, 19 have been _x000D_
responded to. When would you anticipate the other 90-some-odd _x000D_
are going to be responded to?"
2925063,2925062,2925064,19238,1,"    Well, we would like to see this be one of the top _x000D_
priorities for the Census Bureau. My understanding from my team _x000D_
is that the Bureau provided additional evidence late Friday _x000D_
afternoon, so my team will be looking at the progress that they _x000D_
have made in the remaining recommendations. And we are _x000D_
committed to working with the Bureau to ensure that they _x000D_
effectively close those out, because ensuring that the _x000D_
information that they are collecting is secured is of vital _x000D_
importance."
2925064,2925063,2925065,19238,1,"    Sure. Mr. Thompson, do you want to _x000D_
comment on any of that at this point?"
2925065,2925064,2925066,19238,1,"    Yes, Senator. My team is of the perspective _x000D_
that we have responded to all of the concerns. However, we have _x000D_
obviously not communicated that to our colleagues at the GAO, _x000D_
and I certainly intend to make sure we communicate that and we _x000D_
reach agreement as to which ones have been responded to, which _x000D_
ones have not, and what we have to do. And then I would be _x000D_
pleased to send a report back to you."
2925066,2925065,2925067,19238,1,"    Good. There has been great conversation _x000D_
in the last several years about the questions that are included _x000D_
or not included. There was a little bit of conversation in 2010 _x000D_
over the issue of citizenship, as I am sure you will remember _x000D_
distinctly. Where do we stand on that conversation for 2020 as _x000D_
far as whether citizenship will be asked or are we going to get _x000D_
every single house, and then other questions that may change or _x000D_
that are being currently considered and when that list will get _x000D_
to us and we are evaluating these questions to be different _x000D_
than the previous 10 that were there, and when will we get a _x000D_
chance to take a look at those as well?"
2925067,2925066,2925068,19238,1,"    Senator, right now the citizenship question _x000D_
is on the American Community Survey. We have not received a _x000D_
request, because that is what determines the content of the _x000D_
Census, from those entities that have asked us to put that on _x000D_
there. So we have not received a request to put citizenship on _x000D_
the Census itself._x000D_
    Let me be clear about a couple things. In 2017, we will be _x000D_
submitting the topics that we plan to ask on both the Census _x000D_
and the American Community Survey to the Congress, and in 2018, _x000D_
we will be submitting the actual questions."
2925068,2925067,2925069,19238,1,"    OK. And let me ask about the American _x000D_
Community Survey. There has been a lot of consternation in _x000D_
Oklahoma, and I would assume in other States as well, about the _x000D_
nature of how it is collected if you do not respond to it. My _x000D_
office consistently gets calls from individuals saying someone _x000D_
is at their door, someone is parked outside. We have a single _x000D_
mom that is very uncomfortable that there is some guy outside _x000D_
in a car; they are knocking on the door consistently. All of _x000D_
those things to get the American Community Survey. How are we _x000D_
going to put this into a process that they understand this is a _x000D_
Federal Government that is working for them rather than a _x000D_
Federal Government that is stalking them? If they do not want _x000D_
to complete this, shifting that to a voluntary status, and so _x000D_
we can have some way that they do not feel like it is _x000D_
oppressive coming after them to be able to fill out the _x000D_
American Community Survey?"
2925069,2925068,2925070,19238,1,"    Thank you, Senator. I have heard the concerns _x000D_
about the American Community Survey. While it provides a wealth _x000D_
of very important information that is used by the Federal _x000D_
Government to allocate funds by State and local governments and _x000D_
by businesses to create jobs, we understand that there are _x000D_
concerns with the length of the American Community Survey and _x000D_
with the perception that the language on the envelope which _x000D_
says your response is required by law is offsetting. So we have _x000D_
embarked on a program to look at how we can address these _x000D_
concerns, and we are doing a number of things. We are looking _x000D_
to see if we can make the questionnaire shorter by asking some _x000D_
questions every other year if the data is not needed on an _x000D_
annual basis."
2925070,2925069,2925071,19238,1,"    There is some publicly available data as _x000D_
well that we seem to replicate."
2925071,2925070,2925072,19238,1,"    Right. And we are also looking to see if we _x000D_
can use administrative data records to answer some of the _x000D_
questions on the form. We are looking at how we can increase _x000D_
our messaging, change our messaging to be more of a _x000D_
communicator, why it is so important that you fill it out, what _x000D_
it means to your community. And we are also beginning a program _x000D_
to test the language that we put on the envelope. So this May, _x000D_
we are running the test. That is next month. We are doing a _x000D_
test to measure the effect of not putting that language on the _x000D_
envelope so we can see what the effect is. So we are taking _x000D_
these concerns very seriously. The Secretary of Commerce is _x000D_
very attuned to this. I am providing a report to her at the end _x000D_
of this fiscal year, and she expects to see some significant _x000D_
progress in this area."
2925072,2925071,2925073,19238,1,"    Well, surely you can understand someone _x000D_
that shows up on your doorstep repetitively with a badge _x000D_
saying, ``I would like to ask you: What time do you leave for _x000D_
work? How many people are in your house? How many toilets do _x000D_
you have in your house?'' those questions immediately raise red _x000D_
flags for a lot of Americans. They do not want to answer it. _x000D_
But they also cannot make this person go away, which is why our _x000D_
office gets calls to say, ``Why is this person here? Why won't _x000D_
they go away? I have told them no, but yet they just keep _x000D_
coming at me.''_x000D_
    So it is not just the nature of the questions, the length _x000D_
of the questions, the type of questions. It is the treatment of _x000D_
the individual that is at their door and the repetitive push _x000D_
for them. So there is a whole series of issues there. I _x000D_
understand the information is valuable, but there are a lot of _x000D_
issues that are still there in the American Community Survey _x000D_
that we have to resolve, and I am glad to hear that--you said _x000D_
this testing is in May. When will we get results from this?"
2925073,2925072,2925074,19238,1,"    I do not know exactly, but we do not intend _x000D_
to take that long to get it out."
2925074,2925073,2925075,19238,1,    OK. So give me an example: By December?
2925075,2925074,2925076,19238,1,"    Oh, definitely by December."
2925076,2925075,2925077,19238,1,"    OK. So this year, this summer? Into the _x000D_
summer?"
2925077,2925076,2925078,19238,1,"    I would hope so. But I do not want to commit _x000D_
to it, but we will definitely have it by December, probably _x000D_
much sooner than that."
2925078,2925077,2925079,19238,1,    OK. Thank you. Senator Carper.
2925079,2925078,2925080,19238,1,"    Before I move away from the American _x000D_
Community Survey, let us say if my household were one of those _x000D_
chosen in Delaware for the completion of the survey, is the _x000D_
first notification that we have been selected somebody knocking _x000D_
on my door? What would precede that?"
2925080,2925079,2925081,19238,1,"    The first thing you would see would be a _x000D_
postcard notifying you that you have been selected for the _x000D_
survey in the mail."
2925081,2925080,2925082,19238,1,    And then what?
2925082,2925081,2925083,19238,1,"    And then you would get a letter asking you to _x000D_
respond by the Internet, and then you would get a questionnaire _x000D_
asking you to fill out the questionnaire and mail it back._x000D_
    At that point the next step would be if we had a telephone _x000D_
number for you, we would call the telephone number. The next _x000D_
step would be then we would send a person to visit you in _x000D_
person."
2925083,2925082,2925084,19238,1,"    OK. Is there any time during that process _x000D_
we somehow convey to people why this is important for them to _x000D_
do it, to respond?"
2925084,2925083,2925085,19238,1,"    Senator, we do do that, but I think that _x000D_
there is room for us to improve on that. For example, we have _x000D_
already had one training of our entire field staff on how to _x000D_
approach households, and we are going to be doing additional _x000D_
trainings in this area. We need to do a better job of _x000D_
communicating to the American public why this survey is so _x000D_
valuable to them and why----"
2925085,2925084,2925086,19238,1,"    Just to keep in mind maybe what I hope we _x000D_
already do this, but whether it is in the postcard or whether _x000D_
it is in something that folks get over the Internet or _x000D_
something that people get in writing saying, ``You are going to _x000D_
get a survey,'' just to be able to say in a very short few _x000D_
words why this is important, without a whole lot of verbiage._x000D_
    I want to sort of refocus for a little bit, if we could, _x000D_
and talk about cybersecurity. Ms. Cha, we are going to get you _x000D_
in the act here. Let me just ask, what do you believe needs to _x000D_
be done with respect to cybersecurity, on the cybersecurity _x000D_
front, as we prepare for the 2020 Census?"
2925086,2925085,2925087,19238,1,"    First and foremost, it has to be addressing the _x000D_
115 recommendations that we have made relative to those control _x000D_
deficiencies. Again, as I mentioned to Senator Lankford, access _x000D_
controls in particular are of vital importance in _x000D_
strengthening, because those regulate who and what is accessing _x000D_
the Bureau's systems. And so, as the Bureau is exploring these _x000D_
methods to collect data out in the field, including, using _x000D_
personally owned devices or government-issued devices, it is _x000D_
going to be critical for the Bureau to secure those back-end _x000D_
systems to make sure that the information is properly secure._x000D_
    In addition, if they are expanding the use of _x000D_
administrative records, they are also going to have to shore up _x000D_
the controls there to ensure that that information is _x000D_
adequately protected._x000D_
    So addressing our 115 recommendations made is the top _x000D_
priority."
2925087,2925086,2925088,19238,1,    115? That sounds like a lot.
2925088,2925087,2925089,19238,1,"    Well, actually, it is a little lower since the _x000D_
Bureau at this time has addressed 19 of them, so roughly 20 _x000D_
percent."
2925089,2925088,2925090,19238,1,"    OK. You have already talked a little bit _x000D_
about this today, I think, Mr. Thompson. Would you just kind of _x000D_
think out loud again for us on the cyber front? As we sit here, _x000D_
folks from all over the world are hacking into government _x000D_
systems trying to steal our intellectual property, identifiable _x000D_
information, and it is a huge challenge for us. What can you _x000D_
tell us that would make us think that we are up to this _x000D_
challenge?"
2925090,2925089,2925091,19238,1,"    Yes. So we have a multi-layered system to _x000D_
protect information. We limit the access to our systems. Within _x000D_
our program we have ways to control who can access the data. We _x000D_
encrypt all of our individual data when it is at rest, so, for _x000D_
example, our philosophy is that if we have data on a machine, _x000D_
we assume the machine can be compromised and, therefore, we _x000D_
have to protect and encrypt the data._x000D_
    We have some very sophisticated ways that we look at the _x000D_
Internet traffic that moves in and out of the Census Bureau. We _x000D_
work with the Department of Homeland Security on that _x000D_
detection. We also scan all of our outgoing traffic to make _x000D_
sure there is no personal information in it._x000D_
    But having said that, and we do want to get straight with _x000D_
the GAO on the 119 recommendations because we take that very _x000D_
seriously, and we want to be in compliance with those because _x000D_
that is the kind of practices that we need, and we will get to _x000D_
the bottom of that."
2925091,2925090,2925092,19238,1,"    Let me just ask a question. Of the 115 _x000D_
minus 19--what is that, 96--outstanding, are some more _x000D_
important than others? I presume they are."
2925092,2925091,2925093,19238,1,"    Yes, and the access controls-related _x000D_
recommendations are of the utmost priority."
2925093,2925092,2925094,19238,1,"    What Ms. Cha just said, is that something _x000D_
that rings a bell, access controls?"
2925094,2925093,2925095,19238,1,"    I believe we have addressed that. But, again, _x000D_
I need to get with our people and her people and make sure that _x000D_
what we think is addressed is what the GAO thinks is addressed, _x000D_
because I would rely on them and their final say on that."
2925095,2925094,2925096,19238,1,"    OK. Let me ask you about hard-to-count _x000D_
populations. We talked about this already, but it is certainly _x000D_
one of the most challenging jobs in the Census and also one of _x000D_
the most expensive, a real cost driver. Maybe what we learned _x000D_
from the last couple of times out, 2000, 2010, about counting _x000D_
hard-to-count populations, one of the ideas I floated, I guess _x000D_
in the run-up to 2010, was maybe we could have--in terms of _x000D_
incentivizing people, to find ways to really say, ``I would _x000D_
love to''--``I cannot wait to respond to the Census because _x000D_
this is what I will get out of it.'' We threw out ideas for _x000D_
lotteries where people could have their name--if they were _x000D_
early responders, they could be in a lottery, just all kinds of _x000D_
ideas. But hard-to-count populations, people who do not want to _x000D_
be counted, people who do not want you to know they are there, _x000D_
folks who maybe because they are undocumented, or maybe because _x000D_
they are parole violators, how do we get some of those people _x000D_
to come out of the shadows?"
2925096,2925095,2925097,19238,1,"    So one of the most important ways that we _x000D_
have found to help count those populations is through a program _x000D_
that we call ``local partnership,'' and that is where during _x000D_
the decennial census we have a number of individuals that we _x000D_
identified that have local ties to communities, they are _x000D_
trusted voices in the community, and by working with these _x000D_
people, giving them materials about why the Census is important _x000D_
to their community in particular, not just in general but to _x000D_
particular communities, we have seen gains in the 2000 Census _x000D_
and the 2010 Census in reducing the differential undercount _x000D_
between minority and non-minority populations. So we are seeing _x000D_
those gains. It is not perfect, but it does show that the more _x000D_
we can reach out on the local level with trusted voices to _x000D_
convince people to be counted, that works and pays big _x000D_
dividends. And that is something else we are starting to work _x000D_
on at this point in the decade."
2925097,2925096,2925098,19238,1,"    Good. All right. Thanks. Thanks so much._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, if we have another round, I have a few more _x000D_
questions."
2925098,2925097,2925099,19238,1,    Go ahead.
2925099,2925098,2925100,19238,2,"    Mr. Goldenkoff and Ms. Cha, what is next _x000D_
for GAO's oversight for the 2020 Census? Give us a look ahead."
2925100,2925099,2925101,19238,2,"    Our focus is on the operational aspects and _x000D_
the cost-savings estimates, so we are going to be looking at _x000D_
these other four cost-savings initiatives that Director _x000D_
Thompson mentioned. We have ongoing work that is looking at the _x000D_
Census Bureau's use of administrative records. That report will _x000D_
be out in a couple of months. After that, we will be looking at _x000D_
the Census Bureau's use of targeted address canvassing, and we _x000D_
also expect to look at the Census Bureau's cost estimates, and _x000D_
we will try and validate them. Right now they are estimates, _x000D_
but we do not know what is behind them."
2925101,2925100,2925102,19238,2,    Ms. Cha.
2925102,2925101,2925103,19238,2,"    In addition to that, Senator Carper, we will be _x000D_
starting a review for this Committee with regards to the CEDCaP _x000D_
initiative, and we will be starting that later this year, _x000D_
roughly in the October timeframe. So that is going to be very _x000D_
critical because we will know early on whether or not the _x000D_
quality of the September 2015 decision is good or not in terms _x000D_
of the completeness of the business requirements, again, _x000D_
because having a full, comprehensive set of business _x000D_
requirements is critical to informing the system development _x000D_
work downstream."
2925103,2925102,2925104,19238,2,"    Why don't each of you give us--we have _x000D_
already heard you in response to other questions talk a little _x000D_
bit about this. But if you were sitting up here with us and you _x000D_
wanted to make darn sure that we got a good Census at a _x000D_
reasonable price, what are the one or two things that you would _x000D_
do if you were in our shoes to make sure that that happened so _x000D_
that it would not be on us and we would have better met our _x000D_
responsibilities? Ms. Cha, why don't you go first? You look _x000D_
like a potential Senator."
2925104,2925103,2925105,19238,2,"    Well, I think going back to my response to Senator _x000D_
Ayotte, with regards to the complexity of the CEDCaP initiative _x000D_
itself, I think based on the risk that the Bureau currently has _x000D_
relative to IT acquisition, it would behoove them to look at _x000D_
whether there are simpler ways to go about acquiring the CEDCaP _x000D_
initiative. It is quite ambitious, and, again----"
2925105,2925104,2925106,19238,2,"    There are people who might be watching this _x000D_
on television or listening, and they would say, ``What is _x000D_
CEDCaP? '' Could you just explain it in terms that people might _x000D_
understand?"
2925106,2925105,2925107,19238,2,"    Yes. It is the enterprisewide IT initiative that _x000D_
will deliver the systems and the infrastructure to support the _x000D_
2020 Census. So it is a collection of roughly 14 projects and _x000D_
multiple systems beneath those projects. So it is a large and _x000D_
complex IT modernization program, and it is critical that the _x000D_
risks that we have identified with regards to the time _x000D_
constraints as well as their IT posture in general, that those _x000D_
risks inform the decisions about IT that they will be making in _x000D_
September in terms of what is actually realistic and viable for _x000D_
2020."
2925107,2925106,2925108,19238,2,"    All right. Same question. Mr. Goldenkoff, _x000D_
please."
2925108,2925107,2925109,19238,2,"    I would hold the Bureau accountable for _x000D_
meeting costs and scheduled milestones. If you look at where _x000D_
the 2000 Census went off the track and the 2010 Census went off _x000D_
the track, past experience has shown that the Census Bureau _x000D_
either runs out of time or runs out of money. So the best way _x000D_
to make sure that the Census Bureau is on track is regularly _x000D_
checking in with them and monitoring whether they are meeting _x000D_
their cost milestones and their schedule milestones. And that _x000D_
is the early indication that things are going off the rails."
2925109,2925108,2925110,19238,2,"    All right. Director Thompson, if you were _x000D_
Senator Thompson and this was Director Lankford, what would you _x000D_
make sure we get done?"
2925110,2925109,2925111,19238,2,    I would rather comment in a different way.
2925111,2925110,2925112,19238,2,    OK.
2925112,2925111,2925113,19238,2,"    We are putting some things in place to try to _x000D_
minimize the risk, because you can never be sure. So, for _x000D_
example, the document we are producing this fall, the 2020 _x000D_
Census Operational Plan, and it will be 3 years earlier than we _x000D_
issued an operational plan for the 2010 Census. So we are _x000D_
getting an early start on it._x000D_
    We have in place an active risk management framework (RMF) _x000D_
and risk management process where we constantly identify major _x000D_
risks, and we constantly look at how we can find contingencies _x000D_
for those risks. We would be happy to share that with the _x000D_
Committee so you can feel comfortable that we are looking at _x000D_
the right risks._x000D_
    In terms of the enterprise IT systems, we do not argue with _x000D_
the GAO that it is a high-risk system because we are developing _x000D_
new processes. But I can assure you that this is getting full _x000D_
attention from the Department of Commerce. The Department of _x000D_
Commerce CIO is fully engaged with this program and with our _x000D_
CIO on the program. In fact, he is running an independent _x000D_
verification and validation (IV&V) process on the program. So _x000D_
he is taking it very seriously, too. The whole Department of _x000D_
Commerce has this as one of their priorities, and success is _x000D_
one of the priorities of the Department of Commerce."
2925113,2925112,2925114,19238,2,"    Good. Mr. Chairman, I have one more. Do we _x000D_
have----"
2925114,2925113,2925115,19238,2,    Sure.
2925115,2925114,2925116,19238,2,"    In my old job as Governor, when we were _x000D_
wrestling with a problem in Delaware, trying to figure out how _x000D_
to deal with a challenge, sometimes in a Cabinet meeting I _x000D_
would say to my Cabinet, ``Some other Governor in some other _x000D_
State has dealt with this issue. They figured out how to deal _x000D_
with it in an appropriate way successfully. What we have to do _x000D_
is find that State, that Governor, whoever worked on this issue _x000D_
in another State, and find out: Did it really work? Is their _x000D_
solution transferable to us in Delaware?''_x000D_
    We are not the only nation grappling with doing a Census, _x000D_
and we are not the only nation grappling with doing it in a _x000D_
more cost-effective way. Who are some other countries that we _x000D_
are learning from? What are we learning from them?"
2925116,2925115,2925117,19238,2,"    We regularly work with other countries like _x000D_
the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and share our progress; _x000D_
we share our problems. We have an ongoing dialogue about what _x000D_
works, what does not work._x000D_
    So, for example, Canada has been using the Internet as a _x000D_
response option before we have, so we have been working with _x000D_
the Statistics Canada people to understand what they have _x000D_
learned that is both good and not good in terms of how to _x000D_
implement an Internet self-response option. But we do have _x000D_
active discussions going on with our fellow countries."
2925117,2925116,2925118,19238,2,"    Could you give us just maybe one example, a _x000D_
clear, easy-to-understand example of something that we have _x000D_
learned in this back-and-forth with other nations, maybe the _x000D_
ones you mentioned, maybe others, say this is what we learned _x000D_
from Canada, this is what we learned from Britain that we are _x000D_
going to be doing differently this cycle?"
2925118,2925117,2925119,19238,2,"    Well, I think there were two things with _x000D_
Canada. One thing was that the Internet can be a very _x000D_
successful way to get responses in on a very timely basis, and _x000D_
Canada has had great success in using the Internet as a primary _x000D_
response option._x000D_
    The other thing we have learned from Canada is that if you _x000D_
are not cautious about how you word the equivalent of the _x000D_
American Community Survey and the messaging on that, you can _x000D_
lose a lot of data quality. At the last minute Canada had to _x000D_
make their survey voluntary in 2011, and they did not have much _x000D_
time to work on it, and they lost a lot of data quality and _x000D_
were not able to publish a lot of the data from their _x000D_
equivalent to the American Community Survey. So those are two _x000D_
examples of some things that we have learned."
2925119,2925118,2925120,19238,2,"    Good. Thanks._x000D_
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
2925120,2925119,2925121,19238,2,"    One other thing I would just ask you to _x000D_
submit for the record is the controls and how you are going to _x000D_
handle staff for 2020, background checks, citizenship status, _x000D_
and such for actual Census takers and Census staff, so when _x000D_
that is settled and resolved. Do you have a good idea of when _x000D_
you are going to set those parameters?"
2925121,2925120,2925122,19238,2,"    Right now, our intention is to use similar _x000D_
processes in terms of fingerprinting and validation as we did _x000D_
before. However, there is still an active class action suit on _x000D_
that issue, and so we are awaiting the outcome of that, and I _x000D_
do not have an estimate of when that suit may be resolved."
2925122,2925121,2925123,19238,2,"    OK. So the assumption is to use basically _x000D_
the same standards as the last time, pending this class action _x000D_
suit."
2925123,2925122,2925124,19238,2,    Yes.
2925124,2925123,2925125,19238,2,"    OK. Then we will follow-up from there._x000D_
    Going back to the American Community Survey again, is there _x000D_
anything on the American Community Survey that is not publicly _x000D_
available from other places or from other survey teams? I _x000D_
understand our every-10-year Census, that one is _x000D_
constitutionally mandated. The American Community Survey is _x000D_
not. And so what I am looking for are some of the efficiencies _x000D_
that are there of cost. What data can we buy at less _x000D_
expensive--you are saying if it is $97 a person for a main _x000D_
Census but you think it is more for the American Community _x000D_
Survey, is there a company we can buy this same information _x000D_
from for $50 apiece and save us half the money? That is what I _x000D_
want to try to figure out and to see do we need to gather this _x000D_
data this way from Census, or is there a more efficient way to _x000D_
do that? And I would be interested to know if GAO has examined _x000D_
that in the past._x000D_
    So, Mr. Thompson, if you want to just be able to address _x000D_
just some of the other resources that are out there that are _x000D_
publicly available that may already be there. I am sure you are _x000D_
talking about that with your questions, and then other places _x000D_
and efficiencies."
2925125,2925124,2925126,19238,2,"    So, Senator, we are looking right now as we _x000D_
speak at what resources are available to supplement or remove _x000D_
some of the questions on the American Community Survey and _x000D_
getting them from other places. I must say, though, having run _x000D_
a business myself, my efforts in running the business were, _x000D_
trying to keep the business in business and to grow the _x000D_
business. And so I was not motivated to form a comprehensive _x000D_
data series for the entire United States. I was looking at _x000D_
where my data was most important to my business."
2925126,2925125,2925127,19238,2,    Right.
2925127,2925126,2925128,19238,2,"    And so that is why it would be very difficult _x000D_
to get from the business community a comprehensive data set for _x000D_
all parts of the United States._x000D_
    That being said, we are certainly looking to use existing _x000D_
information in lieu of asking people that information."
2925128,2925127,2925129,19238,2,"    Right. So my question is: There are _x000D_
businesses that do this kind of investigation all the time, _x000D_
this kind of research. You are right, they are not trying to _x000D_
comprehensively touch on every single area, but if we are able _x000D_
to say to them, ``We want to buy your data. It has to include _x000D_
this,'' they already have half the data, they could gather the _x000D_
other half and probably half the cost for us as well. I am _x000D_
trying to figure out how do we get below $100 apiece to be able _x000D_
to ask a set of questions when everyone who does surveys--and _x000D_
maybe I am missing it, but I do not know of another survey that _x000D_
costs as much as that one does to be able to do it. I _x000D_
understand the unique parameters that we have with every _x000D_
household, every street. That is different. It is like U.S. _x000D_
Mail has a different set of cost parameters than FedEx does _x000D_
because it is every house, every day, every street. I get that. _x000D_
But I am trying to find are there other ways. Has GAO examined _x000D_
something like that in the past?"
2925129,2925128,2925130,19238,2,"    Not a very detailed analysis. We have not _x000D_
gone question by question. What we have looked at is the _x000D_
availability of some of the data in other Federal surveys and _x000D_
other Federal data, and it really varies. In some cases there _x000D_
really is no substitute for the ACS data because it really gets _x000D_
data down to a very low level of geography, and sometimes that _x000D_
is needed for some of the requirements. Some of it goes back to _x000D_
statute. Some statutes require that the data come from the _x000D_
Census. In other cases, it is just the best data available for _x000D_
that need, and so it is more for administrative purposes._x000D_
    So this is something that the Census Bureau has to look at, _x000D_
go item by item and see what are the alternatives and what is _x000D_
the cost-benefit, again, balancing that cost-accuracy tradeoff."
2925130,2925129,2925131,19238,2,"    Right. But has GAO taken a look before _x000D_
about private entities doing this if we paid them--again, if we _x000D_
are at $100 a survey, are there entities that would gather the _x000D_
same amount of data----"
2925131,2925130,2925132,19238,2,"    No, we have not----_x000D_
have a difference between the American Community Survey, the _x000D_
Census between the Census, and the actual Census. We have a _x000D_
constitutional mandate for the actual Census every 10 years. _x000D_
This one is supplementary data that helps us, but it is not the _x000D_
same constitutional mandate, does not have to be done by a _x000D_
government entity, but is useful to us."
2925132,2925131,2925133,19238,2,"    We have not looked into that, no."
2925133,2925132,2925134,19238,2,"    OK. Well, that may be one that we try to _x000D_
follow-up on in the days ahead and try to find the most _x000D_
efficient way to be able to gather this so that we have good _x000D_
data and information, but we do not lose in cost._x000D_
    Senator Carper, any additional questions?"
2925134,2925133,2925135,19238,2,"    Just one. I do not recall whether you are _x000D_
married or not, Director Thompson, but every now and then our _x000D_
spouses have a way of saying to us, ``Well, whatever plans we _x000D_
had for the rest of our career, you can forget about that.'' _x000D_
Every now and then, my wife--I do not know if it is tongue in _x000D_
cheek or not, but she will say, ``Somewhere down the line here, _x000D_
why don't we just put everything we have in storage and just go _x000D_
and travel around the world.'' And I say, ``OK. When do we have _x000D_
to do that?'' And so far she keeps letting me off the hook._x000D_
    But let us say you were married--maybe you are--and you get _x000D_
into 2016 and your spouse says, ``Everything we have, let us _x000D_
just put everything in storage and let us spend the next _x000D_
several years just traveling around the world.'' And, you are _x000D_
serving this 5-year term. We are grateful that you are doing _x000D_
it. But in order to maintain peace in the valley with your _x000D_
spouse, you declined the President's offer for another 5-year _x000D_
term. And so then we have to figure out how do we get a smooth _x000D_
handoff, how do we get a smooth handoff carrying up to the next _x000D_
Census._x000D_
    One of the reasons we have this 5-year term in law is to _x000D_
try to ensure we have a better transition. But there is nothing _x000D_
to ensure that you will want to stay beyond this at this time. _x000D_
Hopefully you will. But what else are we doing to ensure a _x000D_
smooth handoff of the Census? I think this is premature, but _x000D_
what else are we doing and should we be doing to make sure _x000D_
that, whether you stay or do not, we have that smooth handoff?"
2925135,2925134,2925136,19238,2,"    Well, thank you, Senator. So there are some _x000D_
things that are certain, and one is that my term ends December _x000D_
31, 2016, the term I am currently in. Then there will be _x000D_
another term, which I could be reappointed for or not. But _x000D_
there are a lot of things that are going to happen between now _x000D_
and then, including a Presidential election, that I have no _x000D_
control over._x000D_
    So what I am focusing on is putting in place the best plan _x000D_
for implementing the 2020 Census that I can by the end of my _x000D_
term so that the Census Bureau has good guidance. That is _x000D_
something I can control._x000D_
    I also need to say that the Department of Commerce is being _x000D_
very supportive of me in that effort. So that is what I am _x000D_
doing."
2925136,2925135,2925137,19238,2,"    During an earlier administration, I felt we _x000D_
were at a point where we were really struggling with the _x000D_
Census. We reached a point where I felt that there was the kind _x000D_
of engagement from the Secretary of Commerce that we needed. _x000D_
And you mentioned a couple of times the involvement of the _x000D_
Secretary and the Secretary's senior staff. Would you just _x000D_
characterize that again? Because I think it is really _x000D_
important."
2925137,2925136,2925138,19238,2,"    Thank you. The Census Bureau has had _x000D_
tremendous support from the Office of the Under Secretary for _x000D_
Economic Affairs, they oversee the Census Bureau and the Bureau _x000D_
of Economic Analysis. We have had tremendous support from the _x000D_
Office of the Secretary and from the Secretary herself. I met _x000D_
with the Secretary periodically, and she wants to make sure _x000D_
that we are on track to do a good Census and how she can help _x000D_
me._x000D_
    And we have had tremendous support from the Office of _x000D_
Management and Budget, which has understood our needs and has _x000D_
been very helpful in defining those._x000D_
    So the Administration is behind conducting an accurate _x000D_
Census for 2020 and supporting the Bureau in moving forward."
2925138,2925137,2925139,19238,2,"    Good._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, it has been an encouraging hearing and an _x000D_
important one, and I am sorry all of our colleagues could not _x000D_
be here. On the question of the budget issue that we have _x000D_
raised and talked a little bit about for 2016, our Chairman is _x000D_
on the Budget Committee, and he has been out there _x000D_
participating, as you probably know, in a conference on the _x000D_
budget. So he is probably in there wrestling and trying to make _x000D_
sure we get this bump-up so that we will get a good Census in _x000D_
2020."
2925139,2925138,2925140,19238,2,"    While we are in here trying to make sure _x000D_
that we are protected from a $3 billion error."
2925140,2925139,2925141,19238,2,    There you go.
2925141,2925140,2925142,19238,2,"    Back and forth again. So thank you all _x000D_
for being here and what you bring to this. There is a _x000D_
tremendous gain for the entire Nation. It is a constitutionally _x000D_
mandated operation, and we are grateful for the service, and _x000D_
hopefully we can continue to work on efficiencies and bring _x000D_
down the cost per person and try to examine some efficiencies _x000D_
out of the box in the days ahead. So thanks. Good hunting on a _x000D_
lot of the testing and evaluation and things that are happening _x000D_
to us in the days ahead._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 15 days until May _x000D_
the 5 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions _x000D_
for the record. Thank you all for being here."
2925142,2925141,2925143,19238,2,    Mr. Chairman.
2925143,2925142,2925144,19238,2,"    Yes, sir."
2925144,2925143,2925145,19238,2,"    I want to again mention the name of _x000D_
Lawrence Buckner who was killed in the line of duty, I think _x000D_
about 11 days ago."
2925145,2925144,2925146,19238,2,    Right.
2925146,2925145,2925147,19238,2,    I know his name was mentioned earlier.
2925147,2925146,2925148,19238,2,"    Yes, in the opening."
2925148,2925147,2925149,19238,2,"    You and others extended your condolences to _x000D_
his family, but sometimes we talk about nameless, faceless _x000D_
bureaucrats in the Federal Government, and these are people, a _x000D_
lot of them, who work hard, work long hours, in some cases at _x000D_
great risk to themselves, and we remember him and thank him and _x000D_
other of his colleagues who do this dangerous work. Thank you."
2925149,2925148,2925150,19238,2,"    Entirely appropriate. Thank you again for _x000D_
the way you are taking care of them and their families._x000D_
    Thank you. This hearing is adjourned."
2925150,2925149,2925151,19239,1,"    Good evening. This hearing of the Senate _x000D_
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is now _x000D_
called to order. I want to thank everybody in the audience for _x000D_
taking time out of your busy schedules to attend what I hope to _x000D_
be a very informative hearing. I want to thank our witnesses _x000D_
for their time and efforts. I have read all of your testimony, _x000D_
it's very thoughtful; I think it is going to be very helpful _x000D_
and will be informative._x000D_
    I certainly want to thank everybody here at St. Marcus. _x000D_
Henry Tyson, the Principal, who was very instrumental in _x000D_
helping set this thing up. Pastor Mark Jeske whose office I _x000D_
invaded, I appreciate that, Pastor. And we have some student _x000D_
volunteers, I want to call them up. Joanne, Brielle, Justin, _x000D_
Aleshia, Demia and Ambria, thank you all for your help and _x000D_
efforts. If you can give them a round of applause, I would _x000D_
appreciate it."
2925151,2925150,2925152,19239,3,"    Good evening, everyone. I am a bit under the _x000D_
weather today. I will be reciting my Statement completely from _x000D_
memory, so please bear with me. I thank you in advance for your _x000D_
patience and your understanding._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Shorter appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 39._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My educational experiences have taught me the importance of _x000D_
capacity, clarity and equity. In the fall of 2004, my sight _x000D_
began to worsen; and I realized that for the foreseeable _x000D_
future, I would be recognized as someone who was legally blind. _x000D_
At the time, I was already enrolled in the Parental Choice _x000D_
Program as a student at Messmer Catholic High School, a place _x000D_
where I was surrounded by caring and committed individuals who _x000D_
wanted to ensure that I would be able to succeed academically._x000D_
    Nevertheless, neither my family nor Messmer could _x000D_
financially afford to ensure that I would be able to receive _x000D_
all of the accommodations to support my educational endeavors. _x000D_
My mother and I, therefore, needed to research resources; and _x000D_
we independently sought out funding from private donors. _x000D_
Thankfully, I was able to reconnect with a former mentor who _x000D_
shared my story with a foundation which provided me with _x000D_
additional scholarships. We were able to use that funding to _x000D_
purchase several pieces of assistive technology._x000D_
    Now, that technology coupled with the love, support, _x000D_
attention and time that I received from the staff at Messmer _x000D_
allowed me to truly thrive and excel academically in each of my _x000D_
courses. Messmer also was later able to secure financial _x000D_
assistance from donors which has immensely enhanced my _x000D_
educational pursuits as well as the access that I had to _x000D_
adequate accommodations._x000D_
    After graduating from Messmer, I went on to Marquette _x000D_
University where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Journalism _x000D_
with minors in Justice and Peace Studies as well as _x000D_
entrepreneurship._x000D_
    During my time as an undergrad, I studied abroad in _x000D_
Capetown, South Africa, where I focused on community _x000D_
development and social entrepreneurship, as well as in Uganda _x000D_
and Rwanda where I studied peace and post-conflict _x000D_
reconciliation. In one month, the next month, I will officially _x000D_
earn my Master's Degree in Sustainable Development with an _x000D_
emphasis on international policy and management from SIT _x000D_
Graduate Institute in Washington, D.C._x000D_
    These educational opportunities have reinforced my belief _x000D_
in capacity, clarity and equity. First, capacity. My family, _x000D_
the staff at Messmer, my mentors, my supporters, all firmly _x000D_
believe in my capacity to compete academically and to concur _x000D_
seemingly insurmountable odds. Students with disabilities can _x000D_
indeed achieve their academic aspirations. We have the capacity _x000D_
to contribute to classrooms, communities, the city of _x000D_
Milwaukee, the State of Wisconsin, the United States of _x000D_
America, as well as the rest of the world._x000D_
    Second, clarity. Initially my mother and I were quite _x000D_
confused on where to go and what to do concerning educational _x000D_
issues associated with my visual impairment. Students with _x000D_
disabilities and their families must be properly informed on _x000D_
their rights as well as the educational options. I believe that _x000D_
the Department of Public Instruction should indeed provide all _x000D_
schools participating in the Parental Choice Program with the _x000D_
information that they need to raise awareness amongst parents _x000D_
about their educational choices as well as all available _x000D_
resources for students with disabilities._x000D_
    Last, equity. While participating in the Parental Choice _x000D_
Program, I received the same voucher as all students including _x000D_
those without disabilities which did not fully account for the _x000D_
increased expenses associated with my visual impairment, which _x000D_
is why we had to seek out additional funding from outside _x000D_
sources. And, thankfully, I was surrounded by great and _x000D_
phenomenal individuals who were able to help me navigate that _x000D_
process. But not all students have access to that, and I _x000D_
believe that they should._x000D_
    Consequently, I believe that students with disabilities who _x000D_
are voucher recipients should receive equitable access to State _x000D_
aid. We have to ensure that the Parental Choice Program fully _x000D_
considers and effectively incorporates the additional expenses _x000D_
associated with educating students with disabilities. This _x000D_
would allow the schools to operate with the security in knowing _x000D_
that they would be able to financially support all of the _x000D_
reasonable accommodations consistently throughout a child's _x000D_
education, especially those children with disabilities._x000D_
    To be clear, I agree with the principal premise of the _x000D_
Parental Choice Program. We should all be able to make the very _x000D_
best choices for ourselves, our families, our future. However, _x000D_
the problems with students with disabilities not having access _x000D_
to accommodations when attending private schools on vouchers _x000D_
funded by the State of Wisconsin must be rectified._x000D_
     Schools and parents should be secure in the knowledge that _x000D_
funding from the Parental Choice Program will complement rather _x000D_
than complicate the educational choices of students with _x000D_
disabilities._x000D_
    This program clearly has the ability to bring forth _x000D_
transformative change in the city of Milwaukee and the State of _x000D_
Wisconsin. Moreover, if we focus on capacity, clarity and _x000D_
equity, it has even greater potential to serve as a model of _x000D_
what a State of dedicated supporters, parents, educators and _x000D_
legislators can do to ensure the empowerment of students in _x000D_
general and students with disabilities in particular. Thank _x000D_
you."
2925152,2925151,2925153,19239,3,"    Thank you, Ms. Shorter. Our next witness _x000D_
will be Diana Lopez. And I would ask that you speak very _x000D_
closely into the mic. But let me introduce you first._x000D_
    Ms. Lopez is a recent high school graduate of St. Anthony's _x000D_
High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she graduated third _x000D_
in her class. She plans to attend Yale University in New Haven, _x000D_
Connecticut, this coming fall where she will major in global _x000D_
affairs and minor in Arabic. She is also the recipient of the _x000D_
full tuition Gates Millennium Scholarship which is earned by _x000D_
1,000 minority students around the country. Ms. Lopez._x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF DIANA LOPEZ,\1\ FORMER MPCP STUDENT AND GRADUATE _x000D_
        OF ST."
2925153,2925152,2925154,19239,3,"    Hello. I am Diana Yvette Lopez, and I attended _x000D_
St. Anthony's School in Milwaukee, another choice school, from _x000D_
the third grade to my high school graduation._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Lopez appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 41._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My whole life has been a series of causes and effects, and _x000D_
I know this very well. With this in mind, I knew that in order _x000D_
to do well in life and to do what I wanted to do when I grew _x000D_
up, I needed to do well in school. I knew that becoming an _x000D_
archeologist in Egypt would only be done if I planned it out _x000D_
meticulously. So at the age of about nine, I started Googling _x000D_
universities that specialized in Egyptology, and I knew that _x000D_
from then on I would have to work as hard as I could to be the _x000D_
best in middle school and high school._x000D_
    But which middle school would prepare me the best for my _x000D_
future? Before going to St. Anthony's, I went to a nearby _x000D_
public school. Despite being less than 10 minutes apart from _x000D_
each other, it felt like a completely different world. At _x000D_
public school, I had always questioned why Christmas had to be _x000D_
called Xmas, and why I couldn't sing Christmas songs. I felt _x000D_
weird that when I was in my community, a largely Hispanic _x000D_
community, everything seemed to revolve around going to church. _x000D_
But when I went to school, it was nonexistent. When I asked _x000D_
about it, I was gently told to let it go. I was frustrated._x000D_
    Then one day, my grandma took me to pick up my uncle, only _x000D_
4 years older than me, from his school, St. Anthony's. There I _x000D_
saw a multitude of kids dressed in fancy uniforms and a bunch _x000D_
of artwork on the wall like the prep schools I had seen in all _x000D_
the movies. On the overhead as I walked in, there were prayers _x000D_
and announcements blasting and it just clicked. I called my mom _x000D_
from the school office. I would get to dress up in uniforms. _x000D_
And by dressing up in the businesslike uniforms they had, I _x000D_
would be better prepared for when I had college interviews._x000D_
    Middle school was great. I got to learn about so many _x000D_
things, and this time I could ask as many questions about any _x000D_
religion, not just Catholicism, as I wanted. However, I never _x000D_
knew how valuable going to a private school with choice program _x000D_
was until I started looking for high schools. I had my sights _x000D_
on a school in Bay View here in Milwaukee. It was perfect. They _x000D_
taught French, much needed by archeologists, and they had _x000D_
computer program classes, something I thought was cool. I _x000D_
wanted to go so badly, but the problem was the $12,000 tuition._x000D_
    I did everything I could. I applied for scholarship and got _x000D_
them all, I started saving my money, and I started promising my _x000D_
parents I would pay them back for my tuition once I was rich _x000D_
and famous. It just was not meant to be for me. My mom lost her _x000D_
job, and my little brother was born. My dad was about to lose _x000D_
his job, and we were all living paycheck to paycheck. One day _x000D_
they sat me down and told me the reality. And in my mind, my _x000D_
whole future just crumbled._x000D_
    After I cried for days, I looked for alternatives. In the _x000D_
end, I chose to go to St. Anthony's; and because they had the _x000D_
choice program, I was able to go at no cost. In the end, I am _x000D_
happy I graduated from there because not only did I receive a _x000D_
valuable and wholesome education, but I let my parents have _x000D_
some breathing space and not panic over paying tuition._x000D_
    But, again, actions have consequences. Since I went to St. _x000D_
Anthony's, I was able to talk about religion. Many think that _x000D_
going to a Catholic school means being oppressed and kept _x000D_
thinking inside the box. However, that is not the case. _x000D_
Naturally curious, I was able to ask about my religion and ask _x000D_
my religion teacher about the differences between the Muslims _x000D_
and Christian ideals._x000D_
    Suddenly, my dream of becoming an Egyptologist dissipated _x000D_
and I became interested in global affairs. What if I had never _x000D_
been able to ask about religion? Would I have ever discovered _x000D_
my passion? Also, because my parents didn't have to pay for _x000D_
tuition, I was able to go to a summer program that revolved _x000D_
around international relations. I fell in love, and to this day _x000D_
I have not wavered._x000D_
    During the summer program, there was a representative from _x000D_
Yale who gave a speech and I got in contact with her. Never _x000D_
once did I think about going to an Ivy League school. However, _x000D_
after talking to her, I was convinced I would try as hard as I _x000D_
could to get in. A few months ago, after weeks of grueling _x000D_
applications, I discovered that I got into Yale and every other _x000D_
school I applied to._x000D_
    Now I am going to Yale next fall to study global affairs _x000D_
and Arabic. But the point is what if I had never gone to the _x000D_
summer program and met the woman from Yale because my parents _x000D_
had to pay for tuition. Going to a choice school has opened so _x000D_
much for me. I was able to go to March For Life in Washington, _x000D_
D.C., this past winter; and I got to see firsthand a political _x000D_
movement._x000D_
    I have met so many people of the church who have lived all _x000D_
over the world and taught me how to speak different phrases in _x000D_
different languages and who have time after time reinforced in _x000D_
me the idea of curiosity. My teachers care about me, and they _x000D_
are incredibly knowledgeable in their fields._x000D_
    I hear horror stories about neighboring schools having _x000D_
fights every day and teachers that do not care about their _x000D_
students. I was never afraid of that happening at St. _x000D_
Anthony's. I was able to get the same quality education as _x000D_
someone of a higher socioeconomic standing without burdening my _x000D_
parents and sacrificing their peace of mind._x000D_
    So to those who are thinking about signing your kids up for _x000D_
a choice school, think about the consequences of your actions. _x000D_
You are sending your child to a school where they do not have _x000D_
to worry about negligent teachers or fights every day, where _x000D_
they can ask the questions they want, and where you can rest _x000D_
assured that they are receiving a quality education._x000D_
    To the School Choice Program, I want to thank you for _x000D_
giving me the opportunity to ask questions, for giving low _x000D_
income families like my own a chance to receive a peace of mind _x000D_
after being that one step ahead in the road to my future. I _x000D_
hope to make you proud."

TESTIMONY OF BROTHER ROBERT SMITH,\1\ FORMER PRINCIPAL, MESSMER _x000D_
               HIGH SCHOOL, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN_x000D_
_x000D_
    Brother Smith. Thank you very much, Senator Johnson. Good _x000D_
evening, everyone. I am happy to be here. And I hope you are _x000D_
too._x000D_

    \1\ The prepared statement of Brother Smith appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 43._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Back during the times of the suffragette and abolitionist _x000D_
movements, there was a woman by the name of Sojourner Truth who _x000D_
freed many slaves, worked harder than most men, and wrote a _x000D_
very famous speech titled ``Ain't I A Woman.'' Sojourner Truth _x000D_
was illiterate, spoke broken Dutch, yet she met two Presidents _x000D_
of the United States and was a great preacher who memorized the _x000D_
bible._x000D_
    She was invited to come up north to preach at a church; and _x000D_
a group of ministers heard about it and sent word down and they _x000D_
said: You tell that woman if she comes up here to preach, we _x000D_
gonna burn down the church. And in her broken Dutch, Sojourner _x000D_
Truth sent word back: You tell them men that if they burn down _x000D_
the church, ol' Sojourner gonna preach from on top of the _x000D_
ashes._x000D_
    Tonight we are talking from on top of the ashes. Messmer _x000D_
High School in 1984 was closed. It was reopened by a group of _x000D_
folks like you, parents and guardians who want a high quality _x000D_
school, a Catholic school, in the inner city of Milwaukee. What _x000D_
Henry and others have done here, those young ladies coming in _x000D_
nicely dressed, articulate, who shook your hand and looked you _x000D_
in the eye, are poor kids who have the ability like Sojourner, _x000D_
like Diana, like Justice, to create dreams that will lead the _x000D_
city, State, country and world._x000D_
    All they need is a chance. And that is what the choice _x000D_
program was all about. There is no magic, there is no panacea _x000D_
about it. It is hard work, it is sacrifice, it is trusting them _x000D_
and trusting their parents and guardians to choose what school _x000D_
they want their children to attend. And that includes schools _x000D_
of every faith. It includes cyber schools, it includes home _x000D_
schooling, it includes public schools. All of that is school _x000D_
choice._x000D_
    What has angered me over the years are some of the things _x000D_
that get said that are not misconceptions or mistakes, they are _x000D_
flat out lies. To say that private and religious schools do not _x000D_
educate students with disabilities is flat out wrong and has _x000D_
been wrong for decades. If you do not believe me, there is a _x000D_
book that you can get on eBay titled The Three Archbishops _x000D_
written in the 1920s. In that book, Archbishop Sebastian _x000D_
Messmer says: Take our Catholic school students, test them; if _x000D_
they do as well or better than the public students, then let _x000D_
the money follow the student._x000D_
    Go and look at yearbooks of religious schools back in the _x000D_
1930s, 1940s and 1950s. You will see seeing dogs, Braille _x000D_
machines, that were paid for by the religious schools. They did _x000D_
not get reimbursed by anybody. They did it because they cared _x000D_
about the education of the students._x000D_
     At the end of the day, I do not care where a kid goes to _x000D_
school. And I have said that for decades. What I care about is _x000D_
that they and their parents and guardians get to choose a high _x000D_
quality school which can include a school of faith._x000D_
    When I hear people talking about, well, we care about our _x000D_
kids and education, I expect them to be talking about all kids _x000D_
in the State. See, the choice program in Milwaukee started with _x000D_
under a thousand students. In 1998, we added religious schools. _x000D_
Today we have over 22,000 students in Wisconsin. But we were _x000D_
the oldest and biggest school system for years. Today there are _x000D_
27 States in this country with choice programs. That is the _x000D_
miracle. And that is the key to the future._x000D_
    Before I got into education here, I came from Detroit, _x000D_
Michigan. And I was a parole agent. I got burned out from _x000D_
watching people go in and out of prison. There were three _x000D_
things that were common. No. 1, most of the people coming in or _x000D_
out of prison were dropouts. No. 2, they had drug or alcohol _x000D_
problems. And No. 3, they had at or below a third grade reading _x000D_
level. So anybody that does not understand that education and a _x000D_
bright future do not walk on the same line is missing a lot._x000D_
    We need good schools for everyone. And when I talk about _x000D_
education, I am talking about public schools. There are _x000D_
excellent public schools in Milwaukee and around this country. _x000D_
But we need people to be open to educating all kids in all _x000D_
families and let the parents and guardians and students make _x000D_
those choices. Thank you._x000D_
     Senator Johnson. Thank you, Brother Bob._x000D_

   TESTIMONY OF JOHN F. WITTE, PH.D.,\1\ PROFESSOR EMERITUS, _x000D_
                UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON"
2925155,2925154,2925156,19239,3,"    Well, thank you, Senator. And it is nice to be _x000D_
back here in Milwaukee. It has been a long time since I have _x000D_
been here. I was actually born here in 1946, and we left here _x000D_
in 1951 we claim because the schools were so rotten. Was not _x000D_
true._x000D_

    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Witte appears in the Appendix on _x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My career has been studying the voucher program, twice. Two _x000D_
5-year stints, from 1990 to 1996, and then from 2006 to 2012. _x000D_
And I have taken the opportunity that was offered me here for _x000D_
this testimony to write a long paper this last week comparing _x000D_
those two. We have never looked at both of those studies _x000D_
together, we have looked at them separately._x000D_
    So I want to give you a combination here of what happens. I _x000D_
am just going to say what everybody wants to know. Did it work _x000D_
and what worked? OK. And then I am going to give you my _x000D_
normative perspective and it will be my own values, and I _x000D_
realize there is a lot of room for other values involved in _x000D_
this because I am a little bit concerned about the direction of _x000D_
the voucher program today._x000D_
    First of all, test scores. Everybody wants test scores, _x000D_
everybody complains about test scores; but boy, they sit up _x000D_
straight when you start talking about them. I make my living _x000D_
doing it, modeling it, doing everything else, and I am very _x000D_
suspicious of them. They have a lot of measurement error, a lot _x000D_
of problems with test scores. But the test score results have _x000D_
been flat in both times. There's complications that I could go _x000D_
into later; but more or less we have found out that the voucher _x000D_
program and comparison groups in the Milwaukee Public Schools _x000D_
(MPS) do about the same on test scores. Sometimes reading is a _x000D_
little higher, sometimes math is a little higher. But overall, _x000D_
they do about the same. And, again, there's some complications._x000D_
    Parental satisfaction, there's other dimensions to what _x000D_
qualifies as a good education in what we produce. Parent _x000D_
satisfaction and student satisfaction have consistently across _x000D_
all 10 years, both the first study and the second study, have _x000D_
been positive for the voucher program, and really wildly _x000D_
positive in many cases. And one of the interesting things is _x000D_
when you ask parents what they are most concerned about in the _x000D_
Milwaukee Public Schools and why they go to choice and the _x000D_
vouchers, it has to do with a couple of things. The quality of _x000D_
education, the quality of teachers, and safety and discipline _x000D_
within the schools. Those are the things that they are most _x000D_
satisfied with in the private schools, when they come to _x000D_
private schools, those three dimensions. So it just flips _x000D_
around what they are most concerned about and why they are _x000D_
there._x000D_
    Student--another thing that we were not able to study the _x000D_
first time around, because we did not have the resources, to be _x000D_
fully honest about it, and we also only had K-8 schools in the _x000D_
first set of schools from 1990 to 1996. This time when we _x000D_
began, I insisted that we get enough resources so that we could _x000D_
follow kids through graduation. For me, if there's one measure _x000D_
of quality of education in America and one thing we should _x000D_
focus on, it is graduating from high school. And good things _x000D_
happen on average if you graduate from high school; and bad _x000D_
things, as Brother Bob said, do not happen when you do not _x000D_
graduate from high school._x000D_
    We were able to track kids in the graduation and then into _x000D_
college, 4-year colleges, and we are still tracking the kids _x000D_
that began in 2006. The news is very good here. The graduation _x000D_
rates among voucher students are considerably higher than MPS. _x000D_
And we have done this very well. It is also important because _x000D_
there is very little measurement error actually in graduating _x000D_
from high school where there is a lot of measurement error in _x000D_
test scores._x000D_
    The rates may not seem high; but if you are involved with _x000D_
inner city education, you will know. It is between 4 and we _x000D_
think closer to 7 percent higher graduation and 4 to 7 percent _x000D_
higher attainment in 4-year colleges. They also tend to go to _x000D_
better colleges, and we follow them now into their--at the end _x000D_
of their sophomore year, and they have a high persistence rate, _x000D_
much higher than the average in the schools, and they are _x000D_
stretching out over the MPS kids that go to 4-year colleges. _x000D_
That is a big, powerful finding, the first one I think for any _x000D_
voucher program which they usually do not follow kids as far as _x000D_
we have._x000D_
    One other thing, there is another type of study that takes _x000D_
place within vouchers, and that has to do with what we call _x000D_
competition studies. The Senator mentioned this, that is why I _x000D_
want to talk about this. Competition studies are basically if _x000D_
you have competition from vouchers in an area, do the public _x000D_
schools get better? OK. And we measure these a lot of different _x000D_
ways._x000D_
    There have been four studies in Milwaukee going back to _x000D_
1998, actually the first ones, and then our recent one has been _x000D_
done in 2009-2010, sorry. All of those studies have been _x000D_
positive. There is a spillover effect into the public schools _x000D_
that's positive for vouchers. And the more voucher students' _x000D_
options there are around, the better the results. OK? They are _x000D_
not large, they are not really big, but they are statistically _x000D_
significant and they are always positive._x000D_
    There have also been a number of studies in Florida that _x000D_
found the same thing. So we have a consistent range. Finally, _x000D_
one thing that is very important to me and sort of my rub here, _x000D_
and Brother Bob mentioned this in the very beginning, when this _x000D_
program began, it was to give families that did not have _x000D_
opportunities or alternatives in the Milwaukee Public Schools, _x000D_
to have an alternative that many middle class white people had. _x000D_
And that is to _x000D_
leave--if they were not satisfied with their public schools, _x000D_
they could either buy private school education or they could _x000D_
move to the suburbs, which I have studied here in Milwaukee as _x000D_
well, where the schools were much more positive._x000D_
    Poor African-American primarily students did not have those _x000D_
options, and the voucher program provided those opportunities _x000D_
for the first time in many cases. There were no charter schools _x000D_
around, remember, at that time. OK? Now, and there is no _x000D_
question that over the years these opportunities have been _x000D_
extended and there have been many opportunities, the choice _x000D_
environment is much more positive today certainly with places _x000D_
like Messmer High School or this high school or a number of _x000D_
other places in the voucher program, the vast majority of the _x000D_
schools in the voucher program, 110 of them. They provide _x000D_
choices._x000D_
    My problem is that when I was first asked to do this, my _x000D_
relatively liberal friends in Madison said you are being _x000D_
snookered here. This is not providing opportunities for poor. _x000D_
The real intent here is to get the rich people who go to _x000D_
private schools to be subsidized. I said I hope that's not the _x000D_
case because I am not in favor of subsidizing wealthy people to _x000D_
do things._x000D_
    I am a little worried now that we are moving in that _x000D_
direction, to be honest. I was not in favor of lifting the _x000D_
income limit as high as they lifted it. They lifted it to 300 _x000D_
percent of the poverty line from 175 percent. Now, statewide is _x000D_
still at 175. 300 percent of the poverty line to be eligible _x000D_
for the voucher program is $70,000, $70,047 a year for a family _x000D_
of four. $70,000 gets to be up there pretty high for people to _x000D_
buy their own private education. So I am concerned about that. _x000D_
To this point, I do not think it is necessarily going to be _x000D_
that much of a problem. But if it goes that way, you go to _x000D_
what's called a universal voucher program._x000D_
    Most people in the United States have always gone to _x000D_
private schools for religious reasons. God bless them for that. _x000D_
OK. But it is not necessary for me that the government should _x000D_
subsidize people that can afford that. If they cannot afford _x000D_
it, great, go to religious or nonreligious schools. But if they _x000D_
can afford it, we are going to spend all of our money--and I _x000D_
think it is going to be drained. I think the potential is to _x000D_
drain away the choices for the people that need it the most._x000D_
    So that is my only concern. Otherwise, I am very happy to _x000D_
be involved with this program all these years. I am just proud _x000D_
that I made that decision years ago to do this, and I am proud _x000D_
of being friends with Brother Bob. He is not only the greatest _x000D_
speaker 20 years ago, I swore I would never follow him on a _x000D_
stage again in speaking. He is also one hell of an _x000D_
administrator. He built Messmer High School. I was in there, _x000D_
the first time we met was in 1991, and there were 100 kids in _x000D_
that. And to be honest, he was hanging on like this, like a cat _x000D_
hanging onto the wall, because it was coming down. And now that _x000D_
school is just magnificent, if you have not been there. And _x000D_
also all the other schools that are associated. Thank you."
2925156,2925155,2925157,19239,3,"    Thank you, Dr. Witte. Our next witness is _x000D_
Richard Komer. Mr. Komer is a senior attorney for the Institute _x000D_
For Justice where he litigates school choice cases in Federal _x000D_
and State courts. Prior to joining the Institute, Mr. Komer _x000D_
worked as a career civil rights lawyer for the Federal _x000D_
Government, including the Departments of Education and Justice, _x000D_
and at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Mr. _x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF RICHARD KOMER,\1\ SENIOR ATTORNEY, INSTITUTE FOR _x000D_
                            JUSTICE"
2925157,2925156,2925158,19239,3,"    Thank you. It is a great honor to be here today _x000D_
for a wide variety of reasons. But I would like to commend the _x000D_
Senator for chairing this hearing because the Milwaukee _x000D_
Public--Parental Choice Program holds a special place in the _x000D_
hearts of all of us who have advocated for some 25 years for _x000D_
school choice._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Komer appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 81._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I work at the Institute For Justice, a public interest law _x000D_
firm. And one of the things we do is we specialize in defending _x000D_
school choice programs. So our institute defended the Milwaukee _x000D_
program first in--well, actually, twice. Both times in State _x000D_
court all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court where _x000D_
fortunately the program was upheld both times._x000D_
    School choice is an immensely important issue. But what _x000D_
makes it worthwhile for those of us who do that are sharing the _x000D_
stage with people like Justice Shorter or Diana Lopez who have _x000D_
benefited from the school choice programs that we have defended _x000D_
in court._x000D_
    For me, coming here is in a sense coming full circle _x000D_
because this is literally where modern school choice began, _x000D_
with a program that enrolled just over 300 children in I think _x000D_
it was seven private schools until one of them dropped out. _x000D_
That is pretty small._x000D_
    Today, as Brother Bob mentioned, there are 27 States that _x000D_
have over 40 school choice programs; and the 300 school _x000D_
children in the original program have become 300,000 children _x000D_
across the United States._x000D_
    This is an enormous success story. But what also has come _x000D_
full circle is that my first involvement with the Milwaukee _x000D_
Parental Choice Program way back in 1990 was an effort to kill _x000D_
the program by overregulation, by Herbert Grover who was the _x000D_
then superintendent of public instruction here in Milwaukee, _x000D_
who said that the private schools participating in the program _x000D_
were de facto public schools and subject to all of the Federal _x000D_
civil rights requirements that public schools are subject to._x000D_
    This was a transparent effort to kill the program _x000D_
politically by forcing private schools out of the program. They _x000D_
would not participate if they had to provide all of the same _x000D_
services and act like de facto public schools. Because many of _x000D_
the Federal regulations, I hate to say this, imposed by various _x000D_
Federal agencies are part of why public education is the way it _x000D_
is today. And private schools, to offer an actual viable _x000D_
alternative, have to be different._x000D_
     So that program, Senator Bob Kasten from Milwaukee sent a _x000D_
letter to the Department of Education where I was working at _x000D_
the time asking whether Herb Grover was right and that the _x000D_
program had to act like--the private schools had to be treated _x000D_
like public schools. I got the assignment to respond to that. I _x000D_
was at the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. But _x000D_
we had a crosscutting task force of the special ed. people, the _x000D_
Office of General Counsel (OGC), everyone, to try and _x000D_
determine: Are private schools public schools if kids get _x000D_
vouchers? And our answer was clear. They are not. They are not _x000D_
subject to these laws in the same way that public schools are._x000D_
    Well, now, 25 years later, the Justice Department is _x000D_
investigating them, PCP, and trying again to say that through _x000D_
the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), that the private _x000D_
schools have to act like the public schools._x000D_
    They have done this through trying to force the Department _x000D_
of Public Instruction, to basically impose requirements on _x000D_
private schools very similar to what Herb Grover tried to do 25 _x000D_
years ago. This effort is no more well founded legally than the _x000D_
original effort was because for a number of reasons. It is _x000D_
inconsistent with the Americans With Disabilities Act, it is _x000D_
inconsistent with the department's own regulations implementing _x000D_
that act, it is inconsistent with the Technical Assistance _x000D_
Manual the Department of Justice provides to people as to what _x000D_
their regulations mean and what the ADA requires, and it is _x000D_
pretty much inconsistent with common sense. Because the rules _x000D_
of statutory instruction at bottom are really just _x000D_
commonsensical rules. And under the ADA, there are two titles _x000D_
relevant to their investigation. Title II applies to public _x000D_
entities like DPI. Title III applies to private schools. The _x000D_
private schools that participate in the program under Title III _x000D_
are subject to a very different legal standard of what _x000D_
constitutes discrimination than a public school is. Because _x000D_
private schools do not have unlimited access to public _x000D_
resources. They have access only to what the parents are _x000D_
provided by the program and the parents pay the school in _x000D_
exchange for services._x000D_
    Now, Title III contains a broad exemption for religious _x000D_
schools. That exemption is not an exemption the Department of _x000D_
Justice created. It is an exemption the Congress created. And _x000D_
the Justice Department does not get to overcome that exemption _x000D_
in Title III by saying that DPI has to enforce a different rule _x000D_
under Title II._x000D_
    I am not going to get any more technical than that. But the _x000D_
legal rule is that the specific controls the general. It is not _x000D_
complicated when you are interpreting something and something _x000D_
is specific. What are the responsibilities of private religious _x000D_
schools? They are exempted. You do not get to interpret another _x000D_
part and say, oh, no, because Wisconsin is giving money to _x000D_
individual families to spend at those schools, suddenly they _x000D_
become public schools. That theory was rejected by the _x000D_
Wisconsin Supreme Court in the original case here and it should _x000D_
be rejected when the Department of Justice tries to impose it._x000D_
    This is, unfortunately, part of a pattern because there is _x000D_
a second intervention by the same group of the Department of _x000D_
Justice, the Civil Rights Division, Economic Opportunities _x000D_
Section, which has tried to throw a monkey wrench into _x000D_
Louisiana's statewide program which is for students in the _x000D_
worst schools in Louisiana. And they have tried by resurrecting _x000D_
a school desegregation case to force Louisiana, the State of _x000D_
Louisiana, their DPI, to regulate and limit school choice for _x000D_
students otherwise eligible for the program on the theory that _x000D_
because miniscule numbers of students are leaving supposedly _x000D_
integrated public schools for African-American private schools, _x000D_
that this is undercutting school desegregation. It is an absurd _x000D_
theory. It is so lacking in just basic reasonableness that I do _x000D_
not think that the courts are going to let this stand._x000D_
    The third thing we have with respect to school choice _x000D_
programs is the District of Columbia program. The D.C. _x000D_
Opportunity Scholarship Program was modeled consciously on the _x000D_
Milwaukee program, as were inner city programs in Cleveland and _x000D_
New Orleans. All of these programs are modeled on the success _x000D_
here in Milwaukee. And the D.C. program has shown the same _x000D_
sorts of success as Dr. Witte has talked about here in _x000D_
Milwaukee: improved graduation rates, improved parental _x000D_
satisfaction, all, I should add, at considerably less expense _x000D_
to the public taxpayer than the public schools these children _x000D_
left at their parents' choice._x000D_
    Now, the administration, which has been quite enthusiastic _x000D_
about school choice when it involves public schools, has _x000D_
opposed continuation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship _x000D_
Program and has tried to cause it to whither on the vine. It _x000D_
has only been through the active intervention of this committee _x000D_
when it was previously chaired by Senator Joseph Lieberman, a _x000D_
democrat from Connecticut, and the Speaker of the House, John _x000D_
Boehner, that the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program is still _x000D_
up and running and serving the thousands of children that it _x000D_
does._x000D_
    So I would like to just close and, again, thank the Senator _x000D_
for holding this hearing, thank him for supporting school _x000D_
choice, and hopefully thank him for bringing the hammer down on _x000D_
the U.S. Department of Justice. Thank you."
2925158,2925157,2925159,19239,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Komer. We also should thank _x000D_
Mr. Komer because he cut short a vacation in Maine with his _x000D_
family, so he has a little makeup to do there._x000D_
    I want to break procedure a little bit. I would like to ask _x000D_
Mr. Henry Tyson--is it Doctor?----Mr. Henry Tyson then, the _x000D_
principal of St. Marcus. They have been very helpful in _x000D_
obviously opening up their school to us here. It's been _x000D_
relatively disruptive, but we certainly appreciate it._x000D_
    I met with Mr. Tyson earlier today. And I just want him to _x000D_
share kind of his thoughts and, the model here of--St. Marcus _x000D_
has worked. And, Mr. Tyson, why don't you just go ahead and _x000D_
describe that, and we will just have you too share during the _x000D_
questioning period. So Mr. Tyson."
2925159,2925158,2925160,19239,3,"    Thank you, Senator Johnson. Thank you all, _x000D_
especially members of the public, for being here tonight and _x000D_
showing an interest in this issue. Probably the best way for me _x000D_
to do that is to tell St. Marcus's story and how it fits in _x000D_
with what parents are looking for in our city._x000D_
    This school actually opened its doors in 1875, and by the _x000D_
late 1890s was serving 300 children on a relatively ragged _x000D_
building that stood on this site until about 2002. In the late _x000D_
1960s, this neighborhood was decimated by the riots that took _x000D_
place, really centered on North Avenue and King Drive, just to _x000D_
our west. And there was white flight and the historical _x000D_
Lutheran, white, middle class population fled the city._x000D_
    The result of that was that by 1981, the student population _x000D_
had shrunk to just 54 children. And at the time, the _x000D_
conversation was about whether or not the congregation and the _x000D_
school should stay or should it follow the previous student _x000D_
body out to the suburbs and elsewhere or just close entirely._x000D_
    We got a new pastor in 1980, Pastor Mark Jeske, who along _x000D_
with some congregation members worked like crazy to rebirth the _x000D_
school and the congregation. Such that by 1997, there were _x000D_
about 80 children in the school. And it was that year that the _x000D_
voucher program was opened up to parochial schools. St. Marcus _x000D_
jumped into the program that year and by 2000 had just about _x000D_
100 children in the school. And that brought the old building _x000D_
pretty much to capacity._x000D_
    So the congregation at that time, in about 2000, recognized _x000D_
that there was a huge need in our community. The parents were _x000D_
desperate for access to high quality schools. And the school _x000D_
building at that time was filled to capacity, so they started a _x000D_
five and a half million dollar capital campaign. And in 2003 _x000D_
were able to open a new school building just on the other side _x000D_
of that wall that was designed for 300 children._x000D_
    And as they did that, as that school opened in 2003, it was _x000D_
accompanied by a very specific vision. And the vision was to _x000D_
create the best urban Christian school in America. And combined _x000D_
with that vision was a philosophy that was, like most good _x000D_
ideas, stolen from the KIPP schools, the national charter _x000D_
program, that said we are not going to make excuses, there are _x000D_
no excuses for student failure._x000D_
    And so the congregation, the staff, came together and said _x000D_
what do we need to do to make sure that any child who walks _x000D_
through our doors is ultimately successful. And what that meant _x000D_
was to extend the school day, it went from 8 until 4:30. We _x000D_
needed to implement a Saturday school program, a 4-week summer _x000D_
school program. We needed to have evening programs. So for some _x000D_
students, we kept them here and we fed them dinner and they _x000D_
took care of their homework here at school. And then we _x000D_
implemented a nationwide travel program for our middle school _x000D_
students so they could see for themselves the incredible _x000D_
opportunities that this country offers or should offer to every _x000D_
single child._x000D_
    The bottom line is the parents loved it. And within 2 years _x000D_
of opening the 2003 building, the building was completely full _x000D_
and we had a growing waiting list. In response to that waiting _x000D_
list, in 2006 we started another capital campaign, which _x000D_
resulted in 2011 of the opening of the primary grades building, _x000D_
which is behind me, which houses 350 students. And then in _x000D_
2013, this room, the Krier Center, to support the primary _x000D_
grades building. And then just last year, you would have _x000D_
thought if we just kept building we would eventually get to the _x000D_
bottom of the waiting list. Well, it just did not happen. And _x000D_
the reason it did not happen is because if you are, in _x000D_
particular, low income and African-American, in this city you _x000D_
are in a world of hurt._x000D_
    They recently looked to what they call the 80/80 data, _x000D_
which is they looked at all of the schools in our city that are _x000D_
80 percent low income and 80 percent African-American. They _x000D_
identified 95 schools, public, charter and voucher, serving _x000D_
just under 30,000 children with an average reading proficiency _x000D_
of under 8 percent. So what we know is that if you are low _x000D_
income and African-American in this city, the chances of your _x000D_
child being in a high quality school are extremely low._x000D_
     So it is no surprise that the parents kept on coming. So _x000D_
as it is today, we serve 860 students on two campuses. We _x000D_
opened a new campus last year four blocks north of here. That _x000D_
campus has a waiting list, and in the fall we hope to build out _x000D_
that campus to serve 350 children. We follow to the tee the _x000D_
State's random selection process, so we look blindly at all of _x000D_
the applicants. Approximately 10 percent of our students have _x000D_
formal individual education plan (IEP). It means that they have _x000D_
been identified by the district as a student with special _x000D_
needs. And yet, as Ms. Shorter clearly articulated, we receive _x000D_
zero dollars to meet the special needs of those students beyond _x000D_
the $7,200 voucher._x000D_
    That creates immense challenges for us. It means we have to _x000D_
go out of our way to raise the money to provide the services _x000D_
for those students. This coming year, we will have two _x000D_
certified special education teachers and a host of other staff _x000D_
who support those students with special needs._x000D_
    We do track our students for 8 years after they graduate. _x000D_
We know that 93 percent graduate high school through a _x000D_
traditional high school model. And according to, admittedly _x000D_
questionable testing data, we are amongst the highest _x000D_
performing schools amongst the 80/80 schools in Milwaukee._x000D_
    So the bottom line, as we have heard from Brother Bob and _x000D_
others, the bottom line is without schools like St. Marcus and _x000D_
St. Anthony's and Messmer, and Atonement, Notre Dame, Nativity _x000D_
Jesuit, Garden Homes, the Hope Schools, there would be _x000D_
thousands of children who would be trapped in failing schools. _x000D_
And so the voucher program has become a lifeline to thousands _x000D_
of kids, many of whom have special needs._x000D_
    At the end of that, I am compelled to say because we live _x000D_
in such a divided city that as a voucher leader and voucher _x000D_
advocate, I want to acknowledge that our public schools run _x000D_
some fantastic schools, as do our voucher system, and some of _x000D_
the very worst schools in our city are voucher schools. And for _x000D_
those of you, like me, who are voucher proponents, just as the _x000D_
district has to deal with its struggling schools, so have we. _x000D_
And the critical need is to get as many high performing schools _x000D_
for as many kids as quickly as possible. Thank you."
2925160,2925159,2925161,19239,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Tyson. Again, thank you for _x000D_
all your efforts here at St. Marcus for making your facility _x000D_
available to us._x000D_
    I have a host of questions. Let me, before I start asking _x000D_
questions, let me just get a sense from the audience, would you _x000D_
raise your hand if you would like to take 2 minutes is what we _x000D_
will limit a comment to. How many people would be interested in _x000D_
that? Because that will govern my--OK, so a reasonable number. _x000D_
So I think that we will be able to accommodate that._x000D_
    Let me go informal here, and I would like to use first _x000D_
names, and I have already said Brother Bob. I would like to _x000D_
start with you, Justice. Obviously with somebody with a _x000D_
disability that I think we all are very pleased to see you to a _x000D_
great extent overcome, can you just talk to us about the _x000D_
impediments you faced, both in public as well as in Messmer _x000D_
School, with your blindness; and was there a difference, one _x000D_
way or the other, between what you experienced in public versus _x000D_
private school. And speak very close to the microphone so we _x000D_
can hear."
2925161,2925160,2925162,19239,3,    Is this better?
2925162,2925161,2925163,19239,3,    Yes.
2925163,2925162,2925164,19239,3,"    Yes. OK. I was able to receive, as I said, a _x000D_
ton of attention, a ton of time, from the staff members at _x000D_
Messmer Catholic High School; and they were later able to _x000D_
assist me with also securing additional financial assistance _x000D_
which was immensely beneficial._x000D_
    However, students with disabilities have to encounter a _x000D_
slew of barriers, both formally and informally, both perceived _x000D_
and--a whole range of issues that people never take into _x000D_
consideration. It takes a community to ensure that these _x000D_
students will be able to strive and thrive academically. You _x000D_
have to take into consideration the classroom atmosphere, the _x000D_
atmosphere of the entire school, the communities that they live _x000D_
in, the parents, their families, all of these different _x000D_
entities must come together collectively in order to ensure _x000D_
that these students have the capacity to succeed._x000D_
    I think we have to understand that students with _x000D_
disabilities are assets, not liabilities. And we need to _x000D_
understand the full potential of these individuals. Had someone _x000D_
not seen the capacity that I had, had people not acknowledged _x000D_
that, had people not supported that, I would not have been able _x000D_
to do half of the things that I have been able to do in my _x000D_
short lifetime. I am only 25._x000D_
    However, I continue to encounter a number of barriers, even _x000D_
in graduate school, even as someone who can clearly articulate _x000D_
the things that I need at the age of 25 in graduate school. _x000D_
Now, imagine if I was 5 years old or 10 years old or at the _x000D_
time 14 years old when my sight initially began to worsen._x000D_
    The difficulty in simply acknowledging, for one, what was _x000D_
happening to me at the time and, two, what it was that I needed _x000D_
in order to succeed, but having individuals around me who could _x000D_
recognize the problem, but who can also help me find the _x000D_
resources, and not only find that information, but to actually _x000D_
access those resources was absolutely imperative."
2925164,2925163,2925165,19239,3,"    So did you see--I did not realize, you _x000D_
lost your site at about the age of 14, you started losing your _x000D_
sight----"
2925165,2925164,2925166,19239,3,    Yes.
2925166,2925165,2925167,19239,3,"    It began to worsen at 14, yes."
2925167,2925166,2925168,19239,3,"    And you were in public school prior to _x000D_
that? I mean during that time period or----"
2925168,2925167,2925169,19239,3,"    No, I was at Urban Day Middle School, which I _x000D_
believe at the time was a charter school. Yes."
2925169,2925168,2925170,19239,3,"    But you started accessing the voucher _x000D_
system when you started going to Messmer, correct?"
2925170,2925169,2925171,19239,3,"    I believe so, yes."
2925171,2925170,2925172,19239,3,"    OK. Again, were there--I guess the _x000D_
question is really kind of a moot point then, you were sighted _x000D_
in charter school and you started losing your sight in----"
2925172,2925171,2925173,19239,3,"    When I went to high school, yes. So when I was _x000D_
in middle school, I was able to effectively maneuver and _x000D_
operate. My vision was not good whatsoever. However, I was not _x000D_
in need of many of the resources that were absolutely essential _x000D_
once I went to high school because my sight began to worsen _x000D_
even more and I could no longer hide it or pretend as if it did _x000D_
not exist. It was imperative to my learning."
2925173,2925172,2925174,19239,3,"    So can you just tell us a little bit about _x000D_
your aspirations. And, again, you have overcome an awful lot _x000D_
and you have continued to gain education. Can you just tell us _x000D_
really what you plan on doing now with the rest of your life, _x000D_
what you aspire to be."
2925174,2925173,2925175,19239,3,"    No pressure there. No. I graduate in August, _x000D_
and everyone has been asking me that question. But I am excited _x000D_
to continue applying for positions both domestically, _x000D_
nationally across the country, as well as internationally._x000D_
    I would love to continue working on issues related to _x000D_
international policy. During my time in D.C., I have interned _x000D_
for World Learning, which is an international non-governmental _x000D_
organization (NGO); the Hunger Project, another international _x000D_
NGO; as well as Women Enabled International, which focuses on _x000D_
protecting the human rights of women and girls with _x000D_
disabilities worldwide._x000D_
    At present, I am doing an internship for the Department of _x000D_
State, their international visitor leadership program, and I am _x000D_
developing the disability inclusion guides for host families _x000D_
and organizations to use so that when visitors come, they can _x000D_
truly access all of the amazing things that America has to _x000D_
offer._x000D_
    So I will continue to be an advocate for disability issues, _x000D_
but that is not the only issue that I will work on. I intend to _x000D_
work on a plethora of different issues, whether it relates to _x000D_
disability or gender or racial minority issues, LGBC issues, _x000D_
and a whole host of issues. So I am hoping to secure employment _x000D_
after graduation."
2925175,2925174,2925176,19239,3,"    Well, as you realize your aspirations, you _x000D_
are going to continue to inspire people. So, again, thank you. _x000D_
We wish you all the best._x000D_
    Diana, you mentioned uniforms. I thought that was _x000D_
interesting. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what _x000D_
wearing a uniform did. I mean, just the effect it had. And, _x000D_
again, if you would speak very close to the mic so we can hear _x000D_
you."
2925176,2925175,2925177,19239,3,"    OK. So going to a public school, I could wear _x000D_
whatever I want. So in the morning when trying to get to school _x000D_
on time, it would be what should I wear. And when my parents _x000D_
started to lose their jobs, we had to go to the--those centers _x000D_
to get clothes. And finding clothes that everyone else wore was _x000D_
very difficult. And so I often went to school embarrassed and _x000D_
often went home crying and telling my mom why can't you buy me _x000D_
new clothes?_x000D_
    But when I went to St. Anthony's and saw the uniforms, I _x000D_
thought that it was going to prepare me for the future. Because _x000D_
I had seen how presidents and ministers and everyone wears _x000D_
uniforms; and if I wore a uniform, I would have the same type _x000D_
of thinking as them. And in that way I would be better prepared _x000D_
to do what I wanted to do."
2925177,2925176,2925178,19239,3,"    Did you find that was kind of a common _x000D_
attitude among your classmates? Did people enjoy wearing _x000D_
uniforms? Did they feel it was onerous or--what was the general _x000D_
attitude?"
2925178,2925177,2925179,19239,3,"    Most of them hated it, but ."
2925179,2925178,2925180,19239,3,    But they fell into line.
2925180,2925179,2925181,19239,3,"    Yes. After graduating and talking to their _x000D_
friends from public schools, they had kind of an appreciation _x000D_
that they did not have to wake up and figure out what they were _x000D_
going to wear in the morning. Instead they could, figure out _x000D_
how their homework was and where to, spend their money instead, _x000D_
instead of buying clothes. I think it was the general attitude _x000D_
of appreciation that we knew what we were going to wear and we _x000D_
did not have to worry about impressing everyone else."
2925181,2925180,2925182,19239,3,"    OK. Great. You also mentioned in your _x000D_
testimony the word ``safety.'' Can you talk about that, again, _x000D_
just--again, I am always looking for comparison, to compare, _x000D_
contrast, public versus your experience at St. Anthony's. Can _x000D_
you just talk a little bit about that aspect of the choice _x000D_
program."
2925182,2925181,2925183,19239,3,"    While at St. Anthony's, I have friends who on _x000D_
their phones they would show videos of neighboring high schools _x000D_
and the fights that they would have there, and how they would _x000D_
be really intense and really violent. And all of us just went _x000D_
around the person who had the phone and we all could not _x000D_
believe that something like that was happening not that far _x000D_
away from us. And we all kind of had this attitude that thank _x000D_
God this does not happen here."
2925183,2925182,2925184,19239,3,"    Great._x000D_
    Brother Bob, I mean, certainly what I saw within the campus _x000D_
school system was a pretty nurturing environment. Again, and _x000D_
let me say within the Oshkosh school system, which my kids also _x000D_
went to, I saw--and being the co-chair of the Department of _x000D_
Education Council, I saw dedicated teachers across the board, _x000D_
people who were skilled and knew how to educate the kids in _x000D_
their community. But I did notice a difference, a more _x000D_
nurturing environment, certainly the ability to teach morals _x000D_
and values._x000D_
    Can you just talk about the environment within your school, _x000D_
the extent of parental involvement, and again, any kind of _x000D_
comparison of experience that you know about between that and _x000D_
the public situation._x000D_
    Brother Smith. Sure. I have always, Senator Johnson, been a _x000D_
proponent of the Paul Bear Bryant school of education. He was _x000D_
the football coach at Alabama. And he began each season by _x000D_
telling his players be good or be gone. My belief of every _x000D_
educator, every adult in a school building, is you will treat _x000D_
every child as if he or she was your own. And if you can't or _x000D_
won't do that, then you gotta go. Because parents and guardians _x000D_
entrust the most precious thing they have, their children, to _x000D_
us. And a frown, a harsh word, ignoring a kid that's trying to _x000D_
answer a question or to get a need met, that's a start._x000D_
    And, what Justice was saying in answering your question _x000D_
about some of the challenges, simple things like winter _x000D_
weather, which is unpredictable in Wisconsin. I used to watch _x000D_
her out of my window when there was a black ice. And I made our _x000D_
buildings and grounds people as well as our former principal, _x000D_
Mr. Monday, made sure that that back area was clear and dry so _x000D_
that she and other students would not slip. If there was an _x000D_
early day of school, we had to make sure that she was able to _x000D_
get her ride._x000D_
    Schools live by rules. We have an elevator in Messmer. _x000D_
Students are not allowed on the elevator. She was allowed on _x000D_
the elevator because there are three floors. For testing, the _x000D_
tests are done in a certain way. She needed someone to read _x000D_
directions or if there were colored pictures, things like that. _x000D_
So as an administrator, it is the job of an administrator to _x000D_
make sure that everybody else does what they are supposed to do _x000D_
beginning with the adults and then with the students. And the _x000D_
parents and guardians--and, what Henry said earlier is _x000D_
absolutely true. Parents and guardians that I have known in _x000D_
this city and across this country want the best for their _x000D_
children. They hate nothing more than going to jails and _x000D_
prisons and funerals and hospitals, and they expect the _x000D_
educators and the other students in schools to treat their _x000D_
child as they treat their child. And that's what our jobs are, _x000D_
and they start the minute the kids get there to the minute they _x000D_
get home."
2925184,2925183,2925185,19239,3,"    I want to talk a little bit about parental _x000D_
involvement. I am going to transition from you to Dr. Witte _x000D_
during this question. But, again, it is my general sense, _x000D_
again, having attended as well as sending my kids to both _x000D_
systems, that certainly the private school system really _x000D_
encourages parental involvement. I guess it's just my anecdotal _x000D_
belief that parental involvement made a big difference. I mean, _x000D_
can you just talk about, how, to what extent Messmer encouraged _x000D_
parental involvement, kind of what your belief was; and then I _x000D_
am going to turn it over to Professor Witte, is there any study _x000D_
that kind of backs up whatever our beliefs might be. But, _x000D_
Brother Bob._x000D_
    Brother Smith. Yes. The key, Senator, is we tell students _x000D_
that from day one that the adults run this building; and that _x000D_
means the faculty, staff and parents. So just as the students _x000D_
at St. Marcus were out there greeting every person that walked _x000D_
in that door, we teach the students you will treat every person _x000D_
with dignity, respect and love, or you gotta go. And it's _x000D_
really that simple. Parents and guardians do the same thing. _x000D_
And we expect that they will treat the teachers and other staff _x000D_
the exact same way, as adults._x000D_
    It is irrelevant whether I have a Master's Degree or a high _x000D_
school diploma, we are still adults and the education of every _x000D_
single student is the responsibility of every single adult. _x000D_
Private schools and, in particular, religious schools have a _x000D_
lot less money than public schools. We do not have a tax base _x000D_
to operate on. Which means there has to be a lot of volunteer _x000D_
work, it means tutoring, making sure your students do their _x000D_
homework. And it does not matter if you understand trigonometry _x000D_
or Spanish, it means that you have a responsibility, whether _x000D_
you go to the Khan Academies on the Internet or whether you _x000D_
call up another parent and say can you check my child's _x000D_
homework, the homework gets checked. So that when that student _x000D_
comes to school the next morning, that they come prepared._x000D_
    It also means that if you have a problem in your family, _x000D_
that there is an illness or a death and you need money, that _x000D_
you talk to us. We do not have a lot of stuff, but we can do a _x000D_
little. Recently that 11-year-old boy who opened the door, he's _x000D_
a student from Burma, and these guys went in and shot the _x000D_
father. He was a student at St. Rose/St. Leo. The entire _x000D_
Messmer community gathered around as well as Marquette High _x000D_
school to help support funeral costs and other costs of that _x000D_
family because they are dirt poor. You do it not because you _x000D_
have to do, but because you choose to."
2925185,2925184,2925186,19239,3,"    You used a word that put a smile on my _x000D_
face, ``volunteer.'' We had one of the moms--that was her _x000D_
license plate. And she was one heck of a volunteer._x000D_
    Dr. Witte, can you just kind of describe any kind of study _x000D_
results in terms of parental involvement in education."
2925186,2925185,2925187,19239,3,"    Yes. We extensively ask about parental _x000D_
involvement, both the beginning in the first wave, first study, _x000D_
with what they had in the public schools, and then also to _x000D_
compare it to the private schools. And we also asked public _x000D_
school parents. And we asked three types of parental _x000D_
involvement basically. In organizations in school like parent _x000D_
teacher associations (PTAs), in activities in schools such as _x000D_
communicating and connecting to teachers and other things, and _x000D_
then parental involvement at home. And there are different _x000D_
dimensions of all of those, too, so they are very good _x000D_
measures._x000D_
    And in the first wave of studies, parental involvement was _x000D_
higher statistically and considerably higher in the private _x000D_
schools than in the public schools; and also higher when the _x000D_
people moved from public schools to private schools. The second _x000D_
wave of studies, it was higher in the parental activities of _x000D_
the school and in belonging to organizations that communicated _x000D_
with schools. But the parental involvement was slightly higher _x000D_
in the public schools at home. So there was an improvement _x000D_
there. And there was quite a change from the earlier period _x000D_
than the latter period._x000D_
    The other thing I will say about the public schools is WETA _x000D_
asked parents to grade their schools, and it's a very common _x000D_
question around the country. A through F, right? Just like we _x000D_
grade kids and like you will get graded at Yale and like you _x000D_
get graded in high schools. So on a four-point scale. And it _x000D_
turns out the first time around, the public schools had about a _x000D_
2.8 average grade, a little between a B and a C, and 2.7 for _x000D_
the private schools. That's because a dimension came here about _x000D_
the schools closing. In the first 2 years, it was rocky around _x000D_
here in the voucher program because the courts had not yet _x000D_
approved it. So people thought it was going to get closed. And _x000D_
we had this very bad school, the Juanita Virgil Academy, which _x000D_
I can identify because we never got to do a case study of it, _x000D_
and it was very--well, that closed in the middle of the school. _x000D_
It was a terrible school. We had pictures of kids throwing wet _x000D_
toilet paper out of the windows at each other. That's the kind _x000D_
of order they had in Juanita Virgil Academy. So it had a bad _x000D_
reputation. Then it really picked up that last few years._x000D_
    This last time around, the public schools graded out at _x000D_
3.0, an easy B, higher, and the private schools at 3.4. One _x000D_
other thing that's important about the two waves, it turns out _x000D_
that the first wave, which there was about 1,500 students in _x000D_
1995, almost all the students were black. OK. 92 percent. OK. _x000D_
It was an African-American program. There were no Asian _x000D_
students, not a single Asian family that we could identify in _x000D_
the program. It's much more diversified now, with many more _x000D_
students obviously, 20,000 students here rather than 1,500 at _x000D_
the end. And it's 57 percent African-American, 24 percent _x000D_
Hispanic, and then the rest is split. And there's 15 percent _x000D_
white. And then there's smaller numbers of both Asians and _x000D_
Native Americans. So it's a much more diverse program now than _x000D_
it was._x000D_
    The parents of the private school kids are still poor, _x000D_
lower income, than MPS parents. They were both times. But they _x000D_
have slightly higher education levels. Not too much the second _x000D_
time around, actually. They were very close of parent higher _x000D_
education. The first time around, the MPC parents, the public _x000D_
choice parents, were considerably lower educated."
2925187,2925186,2925188,19239,3,"    Now, having read your testimony, I _x000D_
understood most of it, that's the point, I mean, it's very _x000D_
complex. I mean, trying to study these, trying to come up with _x000D_
some kind of evaluation is necessarily very difficult. But it _x000D_
did sound in your testimony that student attainment, graduation _x000D_
rates, that you found some real significance there that's been _x000D_
somewhat indisputable."
2925188,2925187,2925189,19239,3,"    Nobody's disputed it. If anybody quibbles and _x000D_
says, well, it's only 4 percent or 5 or 6 or 7 percent, we _x000D_
think it's closer to 7, 7 percent jump in graduation is big _x000D_
time."
2925189,2925188,2925190,19239,3,"    Let me ask you what you mean by that, _x000D_
though. Is it you are going from 70 to 77 percent or is it a _x000D_
point increase or is it a percentage increase?"
2925190,2925189,2925191,19239,3,"    It's a percentage increase, and it's going to _x000D_
about 75 percent for the kids that are now graduating compared _x000D_
to 69 percent. That's the range. Which we didn't make too much _x000D_
of because the problem is--if the kids stayed for 4 years in _x000D_
the private schools, in other words, they were in the private _x000D_
schools in 2006 and they were still in them in 2010, 93 percent _x000D_
graduation rate. 93 percent._x000D_
    Now, a lot of people think, trick, there's a problem with _x000D_
this, and Brother Bob knows this. The first year in high school _x000D_
for these kids--we discovered this time around, it did not _x000D_
apply to the first group--was very difficult for many kids. _x000D_
Because they took them under lottery conditions, and these kids _x000D_
were sometimes way behind. The private high schools tend not to _x000D_
give grades out free. OK? I do not know how else to say that. _x000D_
They have to earn those grades._x000D_
    So what happens after the first year, and often the kids _x000D_
left the private schools because maybe they only got two _x000D_
credits and they needed six because the private schools have _x000D_
high graduation rates. Right? High graduation levels. You gotta _x000D_
have six credits, 24 credits to graduate in most of these _x000D_
schools. So they only got one or two credits after the first _x000D_
year. Then what happens is they look around and they say, gee, _x000D_
how am I going to graduate on time and they may go back to _x000D_
public schools._x000D_
    The public schools have a lot of ways of getting through _x000D_
that are not quite as rigorous, let me put it that way, as what _x000D_
the private high schools are. Now, what the private high _x000D_
schools will do, after they have figured this out, of course, _x000D_
is they have all kinds of remedial type programs, they have _x000D_
summer school in advance for kids coming out of the eighth _x000D_
grade, kids got into schools, low test scores, for example, or _x000D_
low grades in the middle school, they will require them to go _x000D_
to summer school to try to catch them up. They put them in _x000D_
smaller classes, they put them in--remember, there's a whole _x000D_
series of things that we outline in our reports that the _x000D_
schools do to try to solve this problem, but they can't solve _x000D_
it all because often the kids come in so far behind."
2925191,2925190,2925192,19239,3,"    Thank you. Just one last quick question. _x000D_
You mentioned competition studies. Can you elaborate a little _x000D_
bit on that. Anything definitive there in terms, does choice--_x000D_
even at this very minimal level. I need to point that out. _x000D_
There's only 3 percent of Wisconsin students K through 12 that _x000D_
are actually part of the School Choice Program. Now, that is _x000D_
some competition in the public system, but it's pretty minimal _x000D_
competition._x000D_
    So anyway, what results have you found in terms of _x000D_
competition studies?"
2925192,2925191,2925193,19239,3,"    OK. The competition now is more, Senator, _x000D_
because the voucher programs are one thing, but remember we're _x000D_
looking at competition with charters."
2925193,2925192,2925194,19239,3,"    Correct. That's about 8\1/2\ percent, I _x000D_
think, total."
2925194,2925193,2925195,19239,3,"    Yes. You have a lot more in charters. Not in all _x000D_
these places, because a lot of places like in Oshkosh you may _x000D_
not have that many--you have a lot of charters, actually, in _x000D_
Oshkosh."
2925195,2925194,2925196,19239,3,    Right.
2925196,2925195,2925197,19239,3,"    But in some places you don't, like, I don't _x000D_
know, Fort Atkinson where I was raised, we don't have charters."
2925197,2925196,2925198,19239,3,"    But surely, even there, it's about 8\1/2\ _x000D_
percent of the population. Again, it's competition, but it's _x000D_
still under 10 percent."
2925198,2925197,2925199,19239,3,"    But wherever it occurs, and it occurs mostly in _x000D_
the large cities, it's been positive. And this is really across _x000D_
the country. This is not just Milwaukee. This is not just _x000D_
Wisconsin. Florida has found four major studies of vouchers _x000D_
there, and they have all found competition effects._x000D_
    And they do them in different ways. What we did here with _x000D_
the last study done by a man named Jay Green, who was working _x000D_
with me, they did it very cleverly. They looked at the density _x000D_
of charter schools--I mean of voucher schools, in other words, _x000D_
how many charter schools are close. The more charter schools _x000D_
are close to a public school, the higher the achievement gains _x000D_
of the public school."
2925199,2925198,2925200,19239,3,"    So, again, I guess you are basically _x000D_
confirming what my basic principle would be is competition _x000D_
actually works, it drives quality, even at a pretty minimal _x000D_
level, because we are talking a pretty minimal level of _x000D_
competition. This isn't like it's full competition, this is _x000D_
still pretty minimal."
2925200,2925199,2925201,19239,3,"    Yes. That's correct. I think that's absolutely _x000D_
correct."
2925201,2925200,2925202,19239,3,"    Thank you. Mr. Komer, I know opponents _x000D_
obviously will talk about public payments or public support for _x000D_
religious schools and the separation of church and state. One _x000D_
thing I have always thought about is within our university _x000D_
system, we have Pell Grants, we have student subsidized loans. _x000D_
Is there any legal difference between that type of public _x000D_
support for _x000D_
potential--for example, Notre Dame or, other religious _x000D_
universities, religious high schools or K through 12 or K, _x000D_
lower level? And, again, speak right into your microphone."
2925202,2925201,2925203,19239,3,"    At this point, since we won a case called Zelman _x000D_
versus Simmons-Harris involving the Cleveland scholarship _x000D_
program, which was, once again, modeled on Milwaukee, there is _x000D_
no legal difference between higher education programs and lower _x000D_
education programs. For many years, in trying to explain what _x000D_
is school choice, we would always point to these other programs _x000D_
at higher education, like Pell Grant programs. And almost every _x000D_
State has a Pell Grant-like program of State scholarships that _x000D_
have very similar eligibility requirements as the Federal Pell _x000D_
Grant program. We use vouchers in housing programs. Section 8 _x000D_
housing is a voucher program. We have pre-K voucher programs. _x000D_
We have childcare voucher programs. It was K-12 education that _x000D_
was unique in not having voucher programs and not allowing _x000D_
private religious schools to participate on an equal basis._x000D_
    The difference, of course, was K-12 education is the only _x000D_
place where we provide free public education. And because it _x000D_
was free and a monopoly, there were no competitive effects; and _x000D_
like any public monopoly or private monopoly, monopolists don't _x000D_
like competition, they don't want competition because it allows _x000D_
them to be inefficient. It allows them to get away with _x000D_
failure. Don't get me started on how public education----"
2925203,2925202,2925204,19239,3,"    OK. We won't._x000D_
funding every year. But it is a system that rewards failure and _x000D_
is, just like other systems, based on the ignorance of the _x000D_
American public._x000D_
    Because if you knew what was being spent on children in the _x000D_
public schools per capita, you would be aghast in most States."
2925204,2925203,2925205,19239,3,"    Well, let me give you some figures on _x000D_
that. In Milwaukee, it's about $12,000 per pupil. In _x000D_
Washington, DC, it's $29,000. That's the most recent figure. _x000D_
Now, just real quick, I mean, think of if you had 20 students _x000D_
and you got $29,000 per student, that's almost $600,000. I _x000D_
mean, in the hands of an experienced educator, I think you _x000D_
could do a pretty good job educating 20 kids for $600,000._x000D_
    But let me ask you, because in your testimony, your written _x000D_
testimony, you talked about--I think you raised this issue, _x000D_
that with the Department of Justice investigation of with the _x000D_
way DPI is administering this program in terms of disability _x000D_
discrimination, that would really be more the jurisdiction and _x000D_
function of Department of Education, not Department of Justice._x000D_
    Can you just talk about that, the appropriateness or the _x000D_
legal jurisdiction of the Department of Justice to even be _x000D_
pressing this investigation."
2925205,2925204,2925206,19239,3,"    Sure. The Americans With Disabilities Act covers _x000D_
pretty much everything. But it assigns to eight different areas _x000D_
of enforcement, to different Federal agencies. Not _x000D_
surprisingly, education is generally assigned to the U.S. _x000D_
Department of Education where it's vested in the Office For _x000D_
Civil Rights which is when I was at the Office For Civil Rights _x000D_
we were answering the Milwaukee question way back in 1990 under _x000D_
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which _x000D_
was a Department of Education program, and under Section 504._x000D_
    Now, the IDEA says that for education, you are supposed to _x000D_
enforce it the way you do the IDEA in Section 504, which are _x000D_
Department of Education responsibilities in education, and _x000D_
generally everything education related is supposed to be done _x000D_
at the U.S. Department of Education. But in this particular _x000D_
case, there was no referral of the complaints that triggered _x000D_
this investigation to the U.S. Department of Education which _x000D_
has considerable experience with the sort of handicap _x000D_
discrimination issues. Instead it was held by the Department of _x000D_
Justice with no explanation why._x000D_
    And I have no idea why they kept it. It's not really a _x000D_
violation of law not to send it to the U.S. Department of _x000D_
Education. But it left it in the hands of some people who, _x000D_
quite frankly, don't know what the hell they are doing, _x000D_
compared to sending it to people who actually generally know _x000D_
what they are doing."
2925206,2925205,2925207,19239,3,"    We are going to try and get to the bottom _x000D_
of that. By the way, we did invite a representative from the _x000D_
Department of Justice to testify here and they declined._x000D_
    Professor Witte, before--I forgot to ask you a little bit _x000D_
about in terms of just macro evaluations. And, from my _x000D_
standpoint, for example, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship _x000D_
applied. There's 6,252 vouchers that are granted. So people are _x000D_
applying at 2.5, 2.6 times the rate. So demand is 2.6 higher _x000D_
than supply._x000D_
    And then, again, how--it's incredibly complex trying to _x000D_
evaluate this. I got this little chart from School Choice _x000D_
Wisconsin. Obviously an advocate. But I thought this was a _x000D_
pretty strong evaluator. As a business person, if I am looking _x000D_
at a sales chart that looks like this, and let me just--I know _x000D_
it's hard to see. But let me just read off the results here. In _x000D_
the year 2000, 8,000 students took advantage of school choice; _x000D_
in 2005, it was almost 16,000. By 2010, it was 21,000. Last _x000D_
year it was almost 30,000. No matter what your studies say, no _x000D_
matter, the controversy over does it do a better job, have _x000D_
better educational outcomes, I mean, this is a pretty strong _x000D_
indication that the parents and the kids, the customers, _x000D_
obviously see value in their voting with their feet by _x000D_
accessing and taking advantage of the voucher program._x000D_
    Would you kind of agree with that statement?"
2925207,2925206,2925208,19239,3,"    Yes. I think that 29,000 might be applications. _x000D_
Does that----"
2925208,2925207,2925209,19239,3,"    No. I believe this is total, this is _x000D_
Milwaukee, plus Racine, this is the statewide program."
2925209,2925208,2925210,19239,3,"    Oh, yes, sure. Yes, let me put it this way. 25 _x000D_
years ago I started to study choice. And at that time, _x000D_
basically there wasn't any choice. I mean, you went where you _x000D_
were assigned, and that assignment came because if your address _x000D_
was on one side of the street you went to that school, if it _x000D_
was on the other side of the street you went to another one. _x000D_
And that's still the case in a lot of cases._x000D_
    So what's happened in the United States is just _x000D_
extraordinary. I mean, now most of the people in Milwaukee _x000D_
actually choose a school that's not their neighborhood school. _x000D_
Either through a charter school or the Chapter 220 program _x000D_
that's still going. That's still going out there. That sends _x000D_
kids to the suburbs from the city, or from the voucher program. _x000D_
So it's an extraordinary situation that Milwaukee has done. And _x000D_
the change over time is just amazing._x000D_
    It's actually hard to figure out who is in MPS anymore. _x000D_
Because charter schools are in some cases they are on the books _x000D_
if they go to the Chapter 220 program, they are still on the _x000D_
book at MPS. So it's really kind of difficult to even get the _x000D_
numbers of kids. So you have an unbelievably changed _x000D_
environment. And, in fact, a lot of the times when kids go back _x000D_
to MPS from the private schools, it's because there's no slots, _x000D_
they run out of slots at the high school level or even _x000D_
sometimes at the middle school level. So there aren't enough _x000D_
positions._x000D_
    Henry was saying how they are expanding so fast, it's _x000D_
amazing what's happening with these schools. And they can't _x000D_
keep up, they can't keep up. The good schools can't keep up. _x000D_
They can't expand fast enough. And you literally, unless you _x000D_
want to go to a virtual world, still bricks and mortar matter. _x000D_
And you don't want to have, 50 kids in a classroom to do it. _x000D_
Maybe we should go back to that, years ago, the Catholic _x000D_
schools had 40 kids in the classroom and they did pretty darn _x000D_
well. But, no, it's greatly expanded and that certainly is an _x000D_
indication."
2925210,2925209,2925211,19239,3,"    So, Mr. Tyson, if you would quick grab the _x000D_
mic there. As long as we are talking about waiting lists, just _x000D_
real quickly, how--out of a student body of about 800 you said?"
2925211,2925210,2925212,19239,3,860
2925212,2925211,2925213,19239,3,    What's your waiting list?
2925213,2925212,2925214,19239,3,"    It's somewhere around 300, 330."
2925214,2925213,2925215,19239,3,"    Almost 35, 40 percent are waiting to get _x000D_
into the system. What I am going to do is I am going to ask----"
2925215,2925214,2925216,19239,3,"    What's Messmer's?_x000D_
    Brother Smith. It's a good question. I retired in 2012."
2925216,2925215,2925217,19239,3,    So did I.
2925217,2925216,2925218,19239,3,"    Do you know what it was then?_x000D_
    Brother Smith. I'm sorry?"
2925218,2925217,2925219,19239,3,"    Do you remember what it was then?_x000D_
    Brother Smith. The high school, probably 150, 200. The _x000D_
elementary schools--boy."
2925219,2925218,2925220,19239,3,"    Higher? More than that?_x000D_
    Brother Smith. Yes, it was more than that. I can tell you _x000D_
the _x000D_
K-4, K-5 and first grade were extremely high, almost two to one _x000D_
for every student that was accepted. And there were two classes _x000D_
of every grade."
2925220,2925219,2925221,19239,3,"    So the demand definitely outstrips the _x000D_
supply which, again, if I were judging the success of a _x000D_
program, I would say the demand outstripping the supply by that _x000D_
much is certainly evaluated._x000D_
    What I am going to do because, again, I want to be _x000D_
respectful to St. Marcus's time here, is I do want to give _x000D_
those audience members a chance to make comments. If you want _x000D_
to start lining up, where are we going to set up the _x000D_
microphone? And while you are doing that--so if you want to ask _x000D_
questions, start lining up over here. And then I am going to _x000D_
ask a couple of questions of Mr. Tyson and Brother Bob here as _x000D_
well._x000D_
    You talked about the individual education plan. Can you _x000D_
describe, in the public school system when a child gets an _x000D_
individual education plan, then they get the funding to provide _x000D_
those services, correct? Can you just give us some sort of _x000D_
range of how much additional funds go into a public school _x000D_
versus people on vouchers, you get the 7,200 voucher and that's _x000D_
it."
2925221,2925220,2925222,19239,3,"    Yes. If I may just dismiss the students, the St. _x000D_
Marcus students. You guys are good to go. Some of your parents _x000D_
may be waiting. So you can just--nice job, by the way."
2925222,2925221,2925223,19239,3,"    Yes, thank you very much."
2925223,2925222,2925224,19239,4,"    Senator, I do not have a real definitive answer _x000D_
to that question simply because, as you have stated, in our _x000D_
experience when we have those children with special needs, _x000D_
there are no dollars. So for us it's a moot point._x000D_
    Now, from what I understand, in the public sector, the _x000D_
amount of money that is available to educate the child depends _x000D_
upon the severity of the need. So if you go to Gaenslen _x000D_
Elementary School, MPS, just up the street, absolutely _x000D_
phenomenal school with their special needs population. They _x000D_
have some kids that have two adults on one child, and it's tens _x000D_
of thousands of dollars."
2925224,2925223,2925225,19239,4,"    So bottom line, we already have a system _x000D_
in the State of Wisconsin to accommodate those disabilities, _x000D_
provide the funding to provide the services within the public _x000D_
system. That would be I would think pretty transferable, again, _x000D_
it's a State issue. Professor Witte."
2925225,2925224,2925226,19239,4,"    Yes. We did a report on this. When DPI came out _x000D_
a few years ago saying that there were 2 percent or less than 2 _x000D_
percent of the kids identified in the voucher program whereas _x000D_
Milwaukee had 20 percent identified, this means formally have _x000D_
an IEA, they have an IEA, right, they have an education plan, _x000D_
an IEP. OK. We felt that was wrong and we had some data that _x000D_
applied to it. Because we had these kids that were in the _x000D_
public school and then switch to the private school._x000D_
    And we were able to estimate that in fact the private _x000D_
schools were taking care of kids with disabilities at a rate of _x000D_
about between 8 and 14 percent depending on how we did it. And _x000D_
we also felt that the MPS school with 20 percent were probably _x000D_
over-identifying. They were under-identifying in the private _x000D_
schools because of two reasons; no money, OK, in some cases _x000D_
very severe disabilities that they could not deal with, which _x000D_
is true also of the public. And then also there were some _x000D_
parents that did not want their children to be identified. They _x000D_
were identified in the public system, but they did not want to _x000D_
because they lose legal rights when you get identified. And so _x000D_
they came to the private schools in some cases because they _x000D_
wanted to get help from under. Now, that says a lie. So we felt _x000D_
the numbers were really wrong. And we have them in a report, a _x000D_
pretty sophisticated report."
2925226,2925225,2925227,19239,4,"    So we will close out with two more _x000D_
questions, two questions for both Brother Bob as well as Mr. _x000D_
Tyson. I want you first to address your accommodation of _x000D_
students with disabilities. Brother Bob, you were pretty clear _x000D_
in your statement on that earlier. In one of your testimonies, _x000D_
one of you reported that the public school system sometimes _x000D_
refers students with disabilities._x000D_
    So if you can speak to that. And then second--and do it at _x000D_
the same time, just the financial challenges of running a _x000D_
private school system. I am certainly well aware of that having _x000D_
worked to try and keep the Bleward (phonetic) system _x000D_
financially solvent. And it's a struggle. It's always going to _x000D_
be a struggle._x000D_
    But if you can address both those issues. Then I will close _x000D_
out the hearing and turn it over to 2 minutes of comments to _x000D_
those who want to make them. Mr. Tyson, we will start with you."
2925227,2925226,2925228,19239,4,"    Sure. Well, to answer the first question, last _x000D_
school year, we had students with autism, cognitive _x000D_
disabilities, emotional behavior disabilities, specific _x000D_
learning disabilities, other health impairments, significant _x000D_
developmental delays, and speech and language impairments. So _x000D_
about 8 of the 12 possible diagnoses, we had them here._x000D_
    Some of the more severe students, such as students with _x000D_
moderate autism to severe autism, require one-on-one or small _x000D_
group instruction throughout most of the day. So we have two _x000D_
certified special education teachers who meet that need. We _x000D_
have another non-certified special education teacher who works _x000D_
with other students._x000D_
    We receive about $300,000 in Federal title money, so this _x000D_
is Federal money for low income students who are at least one _x000D_
grade level behind. And some of that staffing is used to meet _x000D_
the needs of the special education students."
2925228,2925227,2925229,19239,4,"    But it's not specifically for that _x000D_
purpose, you are just able to utilize it for that purpose."
2925229,2925228,2925230,19239,4,"    Correct. You asked about the challenges. I mean, _x000D_
I think everybody in the room knows this, urban education in _x000D_
any context is phenomenally challenging. The single greatest _x000D_
challenge that we face is the fact that we have in aggregate a _x000D_
lower income population than the district and we are being _x000D_
asked to educate those children with about 70 percent of the _x000D_
dollars. When you do the math and you figure out, even if you _x000D_
add $2,000 more per child, the number of additional teachers _x000D_
that we would get is absolutely stunning._x000D_
    And so the challenge is how do you meet all of the needs _x000D_
because we want to meet the needs of every single child _x000D_
excellently, how do you do that on such a relative low dollar _x000D_
amount."
2925230,2925229,2925231,19239,4,"    And, again, the cost to educate a child in _x000D_
your system is slightly under $9,000, you get a $7,200 voucher?"
2925231,2925230,2925232,19239,4,"    Yes. The voucher is $7,200 and then we raise _x000D_
about $1,700 per child or about $1.5 million a year."
2925232,2925231,2925233,19239,4,"    That compares to a cost per pupil in _x000D_
Wisconsin in general of about $11,000, Milwaukee is about _x000D_
$12,000, correct?"
2925233,2925232,2925234,19239,4,    Correct.
2925234,2925233,2925235,19239,4,"    Brother Bob, can you answer those two _x000D_
questions?_x000D_
    Brother Smith. Yes, Senator Johnson. One of the things, and _x000D_
Dr. Witte said it earlier, that it's really important for _x000D_
people to know in education and in particular in urban schools, _x000D_
probably the top goal for many parents is safety and security _x000D_
of their children. There are parents who will bring a child to _x000D_
a private school and who will say my child has no special need _x000D_
when in fact the child is attention deficit disorder (ADD), _x000D_
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexic. It _x000D_
may be because I don't want the child on Ritalin or any other _x000D_
medication. It may be because I think the child is going to get _x000D_
labeled later on. It may be because I think you are going to _x000D_
try to kick my child out of school. What is important and what _x000D_
Messmer and other schools have done for years is we try to _x000D_
counsel parents and guardians. No. 1, we do a disservice to you _x000D_
and your child if your child cannot do college prep work if _x000D_
it's at the high school level or other things._x000D_
    That does not mean there are not ways, as Dr. Witte _x000D_
mentioned, if a child comes in deficient in credits, there's _x000D_
Saturday school, there's taking an eighth period, there are all _x000D_
types of things. But the child has to do it, the parent and _x000D_
guardian has to help provide transportation, et cetera. It can _x000D_
happen, but it's not cheap._x000D_
    What also is important is MPS has always referred in _x000D_
Milwaukee students to private schools. And I will be very _x000D_
frank. Sometimes it's done in a very collegial way, other times _x000D_
some of the State superintendents who have said that if _x000D_
religious schools were in the program, we would have Wiccan _x000D_
schools or David Koresh schools. Those same State _x000D_
superintendents called me when a student in MPS was expelled, _x000D_
for reasons I will not give, to say, Bob, can Messmer take this _x000D_
kid. What the superintendent did not say was, Bob, we will pay _x000D_
you for doing it. It means that the kid's low income, you take _x000D_
this kid and you pay for the kid. We took the kid because _x000D_
education is our business._x000D_
    I think at the end of the day, what is important to _x000D_
remember, too, is there are some students that even MPS or _x000D_
other public systems cannot educate. That's why we have a St. _x000D_
Francis School next to Cardinal Stritch, St. Amelia's, the _x000D_
former St. John's School. There are a number of places that _x000D_
students are educated that are paid for, but it's very _x000D_
expensive. And whether you are talking about Milwaukee, D.C., _x000D_
the North Mariana Islands. It's anywhere from $15,000 to _x000D_
$50,000. It's expensive. But the students need to be educated."
2925235,2925234,2925236,19239,4,"    OK. Well, again, I just want to thank all _x000D_
of our witnesses for taking the time and your thoughtful _x000D_
written and oral testimony and answering my questions. I could _x000D_
keep going on, but I want to be very respectful. We told St. _x000D_
Marcus we would close this out by 7, and I want to give members _x000D_
of the audience a chance._x000D_
    What I will do is formally close out the hearing here by _x000D_
saying that this hearing record will remain open for 15 days, _x000D_
until August 4 at 5 p.m., for the submission of statements and _x000D_
questions for the record. The Committee has already received a _x000D_
written statement for the record from Wisconsin Institute For _x000D_
Law and Liberty. We appreciate that. And I welcome statements _x000D_
for the record from anyone else who would like their voice _x000D_
heard as the committee considers these issues moving forward._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2925236,2925235,2925237,19239,5,"    Thanks. Now, what I would like to do, _x000D_
again, I want to be respectful of St. Marcus and to other _x000D_
people so everybody has a chance. So I would--and I'll time it. _x000D_
But if you could make your comment--first of all, tell us your _x000D_
name, and if you could spend 2 minutes. And, please, keep it _x000D_
within that timeframe and I will use that when you are getting _x000D_
past. Thank you._x000D_
    Ms. Christopherson Schmidt. You are asking the impossible _x000D_
from a teacher."
2925237,2925236,2925238,19239,5,"    Again, I would really ask you to speak _x000D_
very closely to the microphone so we all can hear you. So state _x000D_
your name and then speak closely to the microphone._x000D_
    Ms. Christopherson Schmidt. Joan Christopherson Schmidt. _x000D_
But for the last 60 years as a teacher here in Milwaukee and _x000D_
abroad, I have been known as Ms. Chris. And I didn't really _x000D_
mean to be the first speaker, but maybe I should be because I _x000D_
have probably taught longer than any of you._x000D_
    Sixty years is a long time, from kindergarten, early _x000D_
childhood, all the way up through the grades, through high _x000D_
school, college, university, television and radio, and even out _x000D_
in the country wherever kids needed to have some art and _x000D_
activities._x000D_
    I am a little confused at this hearing. Because I was _x000D_
brought up going to a public school that whatever we did in _x000D_
public office at Badger Girls State, it was for public good. _x000D_
Public good, which means all. And if I were still teaching, I _x000D_
would love to teach at your school, Dr. Tyson. Those children _x000D_
are very fortunate. The same for yours. But public school can't _x000D_
say it's either you be good or you are out. They would be sued._x000D_
    I thought, Senator, that your job was to defend public _x000D_
schools; and I do not see anyone here from the public school _x000D_
which is--we have to have by law, it's a civic right. And it _x000D_
has to take every child. And it's the base of our democracy. _x000D_
And if we take that away, even if we don't mean to, we are _x000D_
going to destroy our democracy and we are going to have the _x000D_
beginning of school and power from the top down._x000D_
    The Dean of Education at Edgewood College said it very _x000D_
well. He said the system that we are going into privatizing is _x000D_
here's the test; public schools, teach it; but we are not _x000D_
giving you the same tools._x000D_
    Let me tell you, the children in Milwaukee, the poor kids, _x000D_
many of them children raised by children, if they were given _x000D_
the same opportunities, the art, the music, the phy. ed., _x000D_
access to good books, and maybe breakfast and be sure that _x000D_
there's a home for them at night, they would rise like every _x000D_
child in any school. I have taught in both. I know. It just _x000D_
takes a connection between a teacher and one child. But when _x000D_
teachers in the public school have 30, 40, 50 kids in a class, _x000D_
they can't possibly go out, like I used to, into the core, into _x000D_
the homes, to see a parent and a child if they were not there._x000D_
    I know you want me to cutoff."
2925238,2925237,2925239,19239,5,"    No. I want to make sure everybody else has _x000D_
a chance to speak. So, when you see this--I really don't want _x000D_
to be banging the gavel on anybody. So, please, if you would _x000D_
let the next person come and speak._x000D_
    Really, we are giving 2 minutes per person so everybody has _x000D_
a chance. OK?_x000D_
    Ms. Christopherson Schmidt. But please support public _x000D_
school."
2925239,2925238,2925240,19239,5,"    Yes. And, again, I would encourage you to _x000D_
submit a comment to the record. We would appreciate that. If _x000D_
you would like to submit a written comment for the record, you _x000D_
are happy----_x000D_
    Ms. Christopherson Schmidt. I can't hear worth a hoot."
2925240,2925239,2925241,19239,5,"    I said we encourage you to submit a _x000D_
written statement for the record. OK?_x000D_
    Sir. Go ahead."
2925241,2925240,2925242,19239,5,"    The testimony here in a long form will be part _x000D_
of this record or I can send you the copy as well."
2925242,2925241,2925243,19239,5,"    Thank you, Don. And, again, I really don't _x000D_
want to bang the gavel on anybody. When you see me pick it up, _x000D_
it's already been 2 minutes, so if you can wrap it up, I would _x000D_
appreciate it."
2925243,2925242,2925244,19239,5,"    Again, I would ask you to submit that for _x000D_
the record. You have it written, so I appreciate that. Thank _x000D_
you for your comment. Again, when I lift this up, I really _x000D_
don't want to bang the gavel. Hello."
2925244,2925243,2925245,19239,5,    OK. Thank you. Next.
2925245,2925244,2925246,19239,5,    I don't believe anybody said that here.
2925246,2925245,2925247,19239,5,"    And nobody denigrated teachers. But your _x000D_
time is----"
2925247,2925246,2925248,19239,5,    Ma'am.
2925248,2925247,2925249,19239,5,"    Thank you. That was a purpose of the _x000D_
hearing was to kind of lay out those realities. So thank you _x000D_
very much. I appreciate it. Sir."
2925249,2925248,2925250,19239,5,"    Thank you, Senator. Anybody else? OK._x000D_
    Please. I didn't know whether you were just standing back _x000D_
there._x000D_
    Female Speaker. Good evening, I just appreciate the _x000D_
opportunity to speak to you. I had not planned on speaking, so _x000D_
I felt compelled to come up here._x000D_
    I am an alumna of Milwaukee Public Schools. I went to UW-_x000D_
Madison. And I have three children who attend Milwaukee Public _x000D_
Schools right now. I am not a proponent for public money being _x000D_
funneled out, it's been over a billion dollars since the start _x000D_
of this that comes out of public schools. We are essentially _x000D_
funding two, three, now maybe with virtual schools having no _x000D_
cap, maybe four new school systems._x000D_
    At some point the public schools will not be financially _x000D_
solvent. We need a certain amount of students involved in that _x000D_
to keep it going. Charter schools, private schools, they can _x000D_
pick their students. They get counseled out. And that money _x000D_
doesn't follow the student. The money stays at the school. So _x000D_
that's an extra disadvantage. It's a funding flaw that I gave _x000D_
testimony to already in the last budget at the Capitol._x000D_
    Public dollars support public schools as a civil right. And _x000D_
my children, they have done without librarians, without art, _x000D_
without music, because of cuts and because of money being _x000D_
funneled out of the public system._x000D_
    And I echo the sentiments of the other women that were up _x000D_
here. These women who are up on the panel, they would have _x000D_
succeeded. I mean, my children are going to succeed from MPS. _x000D_
There are children who aren't--and there are also shining star _x000D_
schools in MPS, as there are--maybe St. Marcus School is doing _x000D_
better than some of the other voucher schools. My children's K-_x000D_
8 school, they have almost 400 children there, they have a wait _x000D_
list of over 100 kids to get in. So you can pick those same _x000D_
kinds of things out in public schools._x000D_
    I don't like to see that money coming out of the public _x000D_
school system to fund another--I think we should--all that _x000D_
money should go to resources to support all the children, the _x000D_
children of Milwaukee. Kids who come to St. Marcus have parents _x000D_
who are concerned about their education. A lot of kids in MPS, _x000D_
their parents are _x000D_
not--they are nonexistent. That's all I wanted to say. Thank _x000D_
you for your time."
2925250,2925249,2925251,19239,5,"    Thank you for your comments._x000D_
    Again, I want to thank everybody for taking the time here _x000D_
to attend. I hope you found it informative. Again, I encourage _x000D_
you, if you have any written comments you want to submit to the _x000D_
record, it will be open until August 4th at 5 p.m._x000D_
    Again, thank you to all of our panel here, and have a very _x000D_
good evening. Take care."
2925251,2925250,2925252,19240,1,"    This hearing will come to order._x000D_
    First of all, I want to welcome all of our witnesses here. _x000D_
I appreciate your thoughtful testimony. The hearing's title is _x000D_
``Examining Federal Improper Payments and Errors in the Death _x000D_
Master File.'' And, in particular, we have a very interesting _x000D_
witness who has certainly been the victim of inaccuracies in _x000D_
our Death Master File (DMF): Ms. Judy Rivers from Logan, _x000D_
Alabama. And, Ms. Rivers, I have to say that when I read your _x000D_
testimony--and I would really recommend everybody reading the _x000D_
full testimony. It is quite the story. But I was struck by very _x000D_
early on you made the statement, ``It has often been said that _x000D_
Washington, D.C., is the capital of unintended consequences.'' _x000D_
And we are going to be seeing that here today._x000D_
    But what I would like to say is that we are going to start _x000D_
off with Ms. Rivers testifying, and then I am going to offer _x000D_
every Senator a chance to ask one question, no statements, _x000D_
because then we have to move on with the rest of the panel. We _x000D_
are somewhat time-constrained. But we really want to hear Ms. _x000D_
Rivers' story. It is a powerful testament of unintended _x000D_
consequences._x000D_
    But I have a written opening statement which I will enter _x000D_
into the record,\1\ without objection._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Chairman Johnson appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 43._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    And what I would really like to do is turn it over to our _x000D_
Ranking Member, Senator Tom Carper, who has really done yeoman _x000D_
work on this particular issue for--I will not say how many _x000D_
years, but you have certainly been dedicated to trying to _x000D_
correct the problem of improper payments in the Federal _x000D_
Government. So I think you probably have a few words to say, _x000D_
and I will turn it over to you."
2925252,2925251,2925253,19240,1,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks _x000D_
for pulling this together. And thanks to our witnesses for _x000D_
joining us today._x000D_
    As some of you know, the work that I have done on improper _x000D_
payments for the last decade or so, I have done with Tom _x000D_
Coburn, whose birthday was just this weekend. He is retired, _x000D_
and I know he is here in spirit with us today because he cares _x000D_
a lot about all the money that we are leaving on the table._x000D_
    Remember the story about Willie Sutton? They used to say to _x000D_
Willie Sutton, ``Why do you rob banks?'' He said, ``That is _x000D_
where the money is.'' Why do we go after improper payments? _x000D_
That is where the money is, and there is a whole ton of it, as _x000D_
we know._x000D_
    While our fiscal situation is improving, we still have a _x000D_
big budget deficit. It is about one-third of what it was maybe _x000D_
5, 6 years ago, but it is still too much. We have a debt of _x000D_
about $18 trillion. At a time when many agencies are struggling _x000D_
with tight budgets and facing sequestration on the horizon, we _x000D_
just cannot afford to be making $125 billion in improper _x000D_
payments like we apparently made last fiscal year (FY)._x000D_
    This latest improper estimate represents an almost $19 _x000D_
billion increase over the previous year. After the level of _x000D_
improper payments went down for a number of years, we saw an _x000D_
increase of $19 billion. These payments come from over 70 _x000D_
programs at more than 20 agencies in programs ranging from _x000D_
Medicare and Medicaid to the Department of Defense (DOD). And _x000D_
if we are going to get a better handle on our debt and our _x000D_
deficit--and, frankly, improve Americans' impression of how we _x000D_
take care of their money--we need to sharpen our pencils and _x000D_
need to stop making the kind of expensive, avoidable mistakes _x000D_
that lead to wasteful spending, and make our agencies and _x000D_
programs vulnerable to fraud and abuse._x000D_
    Congress has already taken some steps that are helping _x000D_
agencies to address this challenge. Our improper payments _x000D_
problems were first addressed through legislation that _x000D_
originated in the House in 2002. The Improper Payments _x000D_
Information Act required agencies to estimate the levels of _x000D_
improper payments made each year._x000D_
    In 2010, Dr. Coburn and I followed up on this effort with _x000D_
the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), _x000D_
which expanded the requirements for agencies to identify, _x000D_
prevent and recover improper payments. In 2012, Senators Susan _x000D_
Collins, Scott Brown, and I went further with the Improper _x000D_
Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act. Building off _x000D_
a very good initiative of the Administration, the law made _x000D_
permanent the ``Do Not Pay'' program, which is designed to _x000D_
screen all Federal payments in order to double check basic _x000D_
eligibility requirements. Simply put, ``Do Not Pay'' allows a _x000D_
government agency to check whether someone should be paid _x000D_
before the government pays them. I think that is common sense. _x000D_
I hope to have a discussion with our witnesses from the Office _x000D_
of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Government _x000D_
Accountability Office (GAO)--about how all of these legislative _x000D_
initiatives are working, or are not working, and what _x000D_
additional measures we should consider._x000D_
    We will also spend some time today discussing the specific _x000D_
problems of agencies making payments to people who are actually _x000D_
deceased. For example, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) _x000D_
Inspector General (IG) reported just 4 years ago that some $600 _x000D_
million in improper payments were made to Federal retirees _x000D_
found to have died over the previous 5 years. However, such _x000D_
payments to dead people are not unique to this one program, and _x000D_
improving the collection, verification, and the use by Federal _x000D_
agencies of data on individuals who have died will help curb _x000D_
hundreds of millions, maybe billions of dollars in improper _x000D_
payments._x000D_
    I am actively working with Chairman Johnson, with the _x000D_
Administration, and with our colleagues here on this Committee _x000D_
to reintroduce legislation from the last congressional session _x000D_
to tackle the very frustrating problem of improper payments to _x000D_
dead people. Unfortunately, we have more work ahead._x000D_
    Last week, the Social Security Inspector General released a _x000D_
report stating that 6.5 million people have active Social _x000D_
Security numbers (SSN) who, based on the Social Security _x000D_
Administration's (SSAs) own records, would be more than 112 _x000D_
years old. I think maybe in our country we have had just a _x000D_
handful of people actually live that long. Now we are told _x000D_
there could be 6.5 million? I am not sure where they are, or if _x000D_
they are out there. Maybe not._x000D_
    In fact, a few thousand of the records reviewed by the _x000D_
Inspector General seem to show ``living'' individuals with _x000D_
active Social Security numbers who were born before the Civil _x000D_
War. In the real world, public records show that only 35 people _x000D_
worldwide are 112 or older._x000D_
    We will hear today from the Social Security Administration _x000D_
about their efforts to ensure accurate information about who is _x000D_
alive or dead. However, what should be extremely concerning to _x000D_
us is that inaccurate death data may lead to improper payments _x000D_
by many other agencies across the government and also creates _x000D_
greater vulnerability for fraud and identity theft. We will _x000D_
hear more about this problem and the opportunities for a _x000D_
solution from today's witnesses._x000D_
    I want to make clear my view that the Administration _x000D_
deserves a lot of credit for many initiatives to curb waste and _x000D_
fraud, as Controller David Mader of the Office of Management _x000D_
and Budget will soon describe. But we need to do more, and we _x000D_
have to use every tool available to put our fiscal house back _x000D_
in order and give the American people the government that they _x000D_
expect and deserve._x000D_
    It is the right thing to do on behalf of the taxpayers of _x000D_
our country who entrust us with their hard-earned money. I _x000D_
often think of how the Preamble to the Constitution speaks of _x000D_
``a more perfect union.'' We will never be perfect in this _x000D_
area, maybe in any area, but we should strive for perfection _x000D_
because everything we do we know we can do better._x000D_
    So in that spirit, I look forward to working with the _x000D_
Administration, with our Chairman, and with our colleagues on _x000D_
this Committee and outside this Committee to make real progress _x000D_
this year on reducing improper payments._x000D_
    Thank you so much."
2925253,2925252,2925254,19240,1,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee that we swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you would all stand and raise your right hand. _x000D_
Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?"
2925254,2925253,2925255,19240,1,    I do.
2925255,2925254,2925256,19240,1,    I do.
2925256,2925255,2925257,19240,1,    I do.
2925257,2925256,2925258,19240,1,    I do.
2925258,2925257,2925259,19240,1,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Our first witness this afternoon will be Ms. Judy Rivers. _x000D_
She is a private citizen from Logan, Alabama. She has twice _x000D_
been mistakenly listed as deceased by the Federal Government. _x000D_
Today she will tell her story of the financial impact errors in _x000D_
the Death Master File have on innocent taxpayers._x000D_
    And, Ms. Rivers, I just have to again commend you for being _x000D_
willing to go public with certainly your trials and _x000D_
tribulations, and hopefully your story can help prevent this _x000D_
from happening to other Americans. So we look forward to your _x000D_
testimony._x000D_
_x000D_
         TESTIMONY OF JUDY C. RIVERS,\1\ LOGAN, ALABAMA"
2925259,2925258,2925260,19240,1,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Rivers appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 47._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    First of all, good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper, and distinguished Members of this Committee. _x000D_
Thank you for inviting me to speak about my experiences with _x000D_
the Death Master File._x000D_
    My name is Judy Rivers, and I have twice been listed on the _x000D_
Death Master File. The first incidence occurred in 2001, and it _x000D_
was actually fairly painless because, first of all, I had no _x000D_
idea that it actually happened. I had a couple of identity _x000D_
theft situations. Someone forced some money through my bank, _x000D_
but I had never heard of the Death Master File. And we got _x000D_
those cleared up, and I just continued on._x000D_
    The second occurrence happened during one of the worst _x000D_
periods of my life. I had just spent 17 months taking care of _x000D_
two terminally ill parents, and I think I was probably at one _x000D_
of the lowest points of my life at that time. So this situation _x000D_
did not help anything._x000D_
    I could never have imagined I would reach the point of _x000D_
hopelessness, homelessness, financial destitution, loss of _x000D_
reputation and credibility, unable to find a job, an apartment, _x000D_
a student loan, or even buy a cell phone. Without a Social _x000D_
Security number, you can do nothing in the United States._x000D_
    Suspected as an identity thief became a way of life for me. _x000D_
During the last 5 years, every H.R. person I have interviewed _x000D_
with, police who have pulled me over for perhaps going a little _x000D_
too fast, the first thing they do is go through your records, _x000D_
put you through a file, and when you come up as deceased or _x000D_
that the insurance--they actually do not know if it belongs to _x000D_
you or not--then a lot of questions start, and it becomes _x000D_
extremely uncomfortable._x000D_
    I would like to make it clear that all of the problems I _x000D_
have had during the past 5 years are not only a direct result _x000D_
of the Death Master File. However, the Death Master File has _x000D_
been like a propagating hydra underneath all of my problems. So _x000D_
every single problem that I had, the Death Master File and the _x000D_
fact that I did not have an identity made everything worse._x000D_
    It started when I was providing full-time care to my _x000D_
parents, as I said. When my parents passed away, their home was _x000D_
sold, and I had to relocate very quickly. In my entire life, _x000D_
since the age of 17, I have supported myself, put myself _x000D_
through school. I have never not had a job, not worked, owned _x000D_
my own firm for 30-something years, and really have been very _x000D_
blessed in that area. So when I start looking for a job and an _x000D_
apartment and I am not able to get one, it is like, ``Wait a _x000D_
minute, what is going on here? ''_x000D_
    Everywhere I searched, everywhere I applied, I was turned _x000D_
down. Finally, I had to leave my parents' home quickly, so I _x000D_
contacted an old friend and asked if I could borrow a spare _x000D_
room for a few weeks. That few weeks turned into 3 months. _x000D_
Unfortunately, his landlord asked me to leave at that point _x000D_
because I was not on the lease._x000D_
    So I again went apartment searching. Again, the question of _x000D_
my validity, my credibility, and because my Social Security _x000D_
number did not check out, I was unable to find an apartment _x000D_
anywhere._x000D_
    After searching for a period of 3 weeks and with no choice _x000D_
and something that I thought really only happened on _x000D_
television, I had to move into my car. I did some research on _x000D_
the Internet, got some basic information on how to do that, and _x000D_
the best places to park, such as a truck stop for protection. _x000D_
So my two puppies and I lived in my car for 3\1/2\ months. _x000D_
During that entire time, I was constantly searching for a room, _x000D_
for an apartment. I kept going out further in the areas of _x000D_
Alabama, such as Logan, in order to find someone that probably _x000D_
did not check that closely, but I was still unsuccessful._x000D_
    My situation improved after I ran into an old friend named _x000D_
Mary Kate. Mary Kate had a business building, and the top of it _x000D_
she had converted to an apartment. And, knowing my parents very _x000D_
well and being sympathetic to my situation, she offered the _x000D_
apartment to me. I was in the apartment 2 hours later--after _x000D_
the approval. It was huge, it was empty, and I felt like I was _x000D_
living in a castle at that moment. No bed, no chair, no sofa, _x000D_
no nothing, because all of my furniture was still in Dallas _x000D_
where I was living when my parents became ill. She even brought _x000D_
me a few houseware items, some towels, et cetera, and I was one _x000D_
very happy person._x000D_
    During the period of time I lived there, I continued my _x000D_
search for a job. I continued my search for a student loan. I _x000D_
had reviewed what was available on the Internet and decided _x000D_
that I needed to increase my skills, particularly in the area _x000D_
of project management. So I applied to over 20 online schools _x000D_
and 3 physical schools for a student loan in order to take the _x000D_
courses and get my certification. Everyone turned me down. The _x000D_
information that I received when I asked why I was being turned _x000D_
down always included comments such as, ``Your information _x000D_
cannot be verified''; ``Your Social Security number did not _x000D_
match''; or ``We cannot find your records.''_x000D_
    Finally, becoming concerned, I went to my local SSA office _x000D_
and asked them to check my records to see if I was in the files _x000D_
and if everything was fine. They did a very fast check, said, _x000D_
``No, your records are all in order. Everything is fine, and, _x000D_
yes, you are alive.'' I asked, ``Well, could there have been a _x000D_
mistake in the past?'' And I was informed at that time, ``We _x000D_
cannot check the past. If you had been listed at some time, _x000D_
when the new files are created on a weekly basis and sent out, _x000D_
your name would have been removed, and we do not retain _x000D_
those.'' So there was really no way for them to tell me if I _x000D_
had been listed or if I had not been listed. But since _x000D_
everything was in order, it was fine, and I thought I was fine._x000D_
    My situation at that point went from bad to worse. The _x000D_
apartment building that I had lived in--and this was _x000D_
approximately a year and a half later--a fire code made it _x000D_
necessary for me to leave. As an office building, it only had _x000D_
one entrance and exit, which was not acceptable in the Walker _x000D_
County area at that time._x000D_
    Again, I went on an apartment search. No luck, so, _x000D_
unfortunately, one more time I had to move back into the car. _x000D_
It was beginning to become a habit._x000D_
    The next thing that happened to me, in March 2010, I was _x000D_
involved in a car accident. A lady hit me, rear-ended me while _x000D_
I was sitting at a red light. I did not feel anything, hear _x000D_
anything. I woke up in the hospital a few days later and was _x000D_
told that I had seven vertebrae that were in pretty bad shape. _x000D_
They also kept asking me all of these questions, and there was _x000D_
a lot of confusion about my insurance, whether I owned the car _x000D_
that I was in, whether I really was who I said I was._x000D_
    So I called an attorney, turned everything over to a legal _x000D_
firm, and said, ``Whatever is happening, please get me out of _x000D_
this.''_x000D_
    I went home--excuse me. When I say ``home,'' I mean a car. _x000D_
I went back to the car, started researching the DMF, and, _x000D_
frankly, trying to find anyone that could help me. During that _x000D_
time, I contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the _x000D_
Social Security Administration, the Fair Credit Reporting _x000D_
Agency (FCRA), everyone that I could think of and every name _x000D_
that came up in my searches for any information or any help. No _x000D_
agency could offer me any help._x000D_
    The first people that I spoke to that offered me any type _x000D_
of insight was Pam Dixon and Nina Olsen, both were of great _x000D_
help to me in providing information and also advice on what to _x000D_
do. Nothing to do, no apartment, still no job, still unable to _x000D_
find any kind of job. A couple at my church found out my _x000D_
situation and offered me a camper they had on their property in _x000D_
which to live. I graciously and humbly accepted the invitation _x000D_
and said, ``I will only be here for a few months, and then I _x000D_
will be out of your hair.'' Well, actually, I am still there._x000D_
    The good thing out of it is the fact that these people have _x000D_
become very close to me. They are very close to parents. They _x000D_
have taken me into their family, and I have really enjoyed _x000D_
knowing them. I will tell you that living in a camper, and _x000D_
especially with two puppies, is not a lot of fun, but I did _x000D_
that._x000D_
    The only work I have been able to obtain is work such as _x000D_
cleaning houses and caregiving. And, very candidly, coming from _x000D_
an executive position with a six-figure income, it is not _x000D_
something you like but something you do when you have to do it._x000D_
    One of the problems with the DMF, it is a bad database that _x000D_
paves the way for millions of dollars of identity theft, tax _x000D_
fraud, health care fraud, medical theft for both the living and _x000D_
the deceased, and the U.S. Government. It seldom goes away when _x000D_
it hits you, as with my experience. The problem is when you get _x000D_
one area cleared up, such as one credit reporting agency (CRA) _x000D_
or one banking institution report, someone calls in for a _x000D_
report, and when they are on the phone--and I have listened to _x000D_
this happen--they say, ``Well, this woman has applied for 23 _x000D_
credit cards in a period of 4 years. No one needs that many _x000D_
credit cards. She cannot be honest.'' So then you are right _x000D_
back on the death list again, and nothing goes forward._x000D_
    So it is a matter of every time you get one spot solved, it _x000D_
pops up somewhere else. You get one school to approve a loan. _x000D_
Two weeks later, you get a notice because they have contacted _x000D_
other people, and they have denied the loan._x000D_
    So from a standpoint of trying to handle the entire _x000D_
situation, at this time have not figured out a way to control _x000D_
it. And I would like to say this: I had contacted all three _x000D_
CRAs, the major ones, the banking financial institutions that _x000D_
provide information. Only one company in a period of 3 years _x000D_
ever responded to me. They did not answer a phone call. They _x000D_
did not answer a letter. So I had no idea of what was going on _x000D_
and where._x000D_
    Finally, I contacted Mr. Ron Perholtz who started the DMF. _x000D_
Ron and his brother, Robert, had several conference calls with _x000D_
me. They checked their databases, and told me that I had been _x000D_
listed in January 2001. And, finally ChexSystems sent me a _x000D_
letter telling me that, yes, they had reported me as deceased, _x000D_
and the information they received was directly from the Social _x000D_
Security Administration and that I was listed as dead in 2008. _x000D_
They did not provide the month, however._x000D_
    So I found out where the information was coming from, but I _x000D_
did not find any way to stop it, even though I have been _x000D_
removed from the Death Master File._x000D_
    What I do not understand is in the research I have done, I _x000D_
have seen over 20 hearings in the Senate and in Congress on the _x000D_
Death Master File. So far I have seen nothing come out of any _x000D_
of these hearings. What I am hoping is that you will create a _x000D_
program that will, first of all, provide help for victims, _x000D_
because we have nowhere to go; second, that you will either _x000D_
stop distributing the database or find a way to toss it out, _x000D_
start over again, rebuild it, and do it correctly, and have _x000D_
zero mistakes._x000D_
    Thank you very much for having me here. I appreciate it. _x000D_
And, please, do something for the government and do something _x000D_
for the victims."
2925260,2925259,2925261,19240,1,"    Well, thank you, Ms. Rivers. Very _x000D_
powerful testimony, and obviously that is the goal of this _x000D_
Committee hearing, to try and work toward solutions so this _x000D_
does not happen to another American._x000D_
    My question is: You have been removed from the Death Master _x000D_
File. Was that prompted by your action? Do you know when that _x000D_
occurred? Or have you just found out that it just happened?"
2925261,2925260,2925262,19240,1,"    Actually, I only found out in the last couple _x000D_
of weeks that I was actually listed on the Death Master File in _x000D_
2008. ChexSystems had--the one person that answered my letter--_x000D_
sent me a letter that was dated August 22. The reality is I was _x000D_
still sending them correspondence in October and further. In _x000D_
this letter, it stated that they had reported me as deceased _x000D_
upon information received from the Social Security _x000D_
Administration and that I had died in 2008."
2925262,2925261,2925263,19240,1,"    But, again, there was not a process of _x000D_
you working with the Social Security Administration where you _x000D_
filled out some forms and you knew that your name was removed _x000D_
from the Death Master File?"
2925263,2925262,2925264,19240,1,"    Yes, sir. Although I presented paperwork to _x000D_
check my DMF status, the SSA stated I was not and never had _x000D_
been listed on the DMF or that I had ever been removed."
2925264,2925263,2925265,19240,1,    You did go through that process?
2925265,2925264,2925266,19240,1,"    I went through the process of completing forms _x000D_
several times in order to find out if I had been listed on the _x000D_
DMF."
2925266,2925265,2925267,19240,1,"    But you only just found out that you have _x000D_
been removed?"
2925267,2925266,2925268,19240,1,"    Yes, sir. I had the letter, but, unfortunately, _x000D_
since the letter said, ``Send us all of your information, and _x000D_
we will do an investigation,'' I actually missed the part that _x000D_
said, ``We did report you as deceased in''--they did tell me _x000D_
the year."
2925268,2925267,2925269,19240,1,    OK.
2925269,2925268,2925270,19240,1,"    ``We did report you as deceased. Based on the _x000D_
information from Social Security, you died in 2008.'' And then _x000D_
asked me to send them information and they would do an _x000D_
investigation."
2925270,2925269,2925271,19240,1,"    OK. Well, we will ask some of those _x000D_
question of our other witnesses. And, again, I would encourage _x000D_
everybody to read Ms. Rivers' full testimony. It is a powerful _x000D_
story. Senator Carper."
2925271,2925270,2925272,19240,1,"    Thank you so much for joining us. I _x000D_
apologize for what you have had to go through."
2925272,2925271,2925273,19240,1,    Thank you.
2925273,2925272,2925274,19240,1,"    Somebody needs to, on a lighter note, I _x000D_
once asked a friend of mine, I said, ``Tell me about this Death _x000D_
Master File. What is it?'' And he said to me, with tongue in _x000D_
cheek, he said, ``It is a file in which you do not want your _x000D_
name to appear, because if it does you are dead.'' Well, as it _x000D_
turns out, not always. Not always. You are living proof that it _x000D_
does not always happen that way._x000D_
    If you had to go through this all over, knowing what you _x000D_
know now, what would you do differently? And, again, what _x000D_
specifically would you suggest that we do? Every one of us has _x000D_
constituent services teams in our States, and their job is to _x000D_
help people with a wide variety of problems. We are called _x000D_
every day. And one of the issues that we deal with a lot is _x000D_
Social Security. If you had been in Delaware, a citizen of _x000D_
Delaware, and you called my office or Senator Chris Coons' _x000D_
office or Congressman John Carney's, we would have been all _x000D_
over this, all over this on your behalf. So just keep that in _x000D_
mind. But what would you do differently? What should we do _x000D_
differently, having heard your testimony?"
2925274,2925273,2925275,19240,1,"    Right at this moment other than flying up to _x000D_
Washington and sitting in the Social Security Administration's _x000D_
office until I found some answers, I do not know what I would _x000D_
have done differently. Having been in the marketing and _x000D_
communications and business development area for 35 years, when _x000D_
I found out what was happening, I sat down and created a _x000D_
marketing plan for myself. And I am very thorough in that area, _x000D_
a letter campaign to companies all over the United States. I _x000D_
contacted everyone in the system that I could think of. I _x000D_
searched for companies. I found that if I had experienced a _x000D_
major identity theft right at the beginning, I would have been _x000D_
much better off because at that point I would have been _x000D_
alerted. I could have filed a police report and somebody would _x000D_
have started investigating. But at that point where there was _x000D_
no identity theft, very candidly no one really took it _x000D_
seriously and no one believed it."
2925275,2925274,2925276,19240,1,"    OK. The second half of my question was: _x000D_
What should we do differently? Those of us who serve here in _x000D_
Congress, we serve you and the people in all 50 States. What _x000D_
should we do differently?"
2925276,2925275,2925277,19240,1,    Regarding the DMF totally or just----
2925277,2925276,2925278,19240,1,"    Just to try to make sure this kind of thing _x000D_
does not happen again to other folks in our country, given what _x000D_
you have learned."
2925278,2925277,2925279,19240,1,"    Well, as I mentioned, I think the database _x000D_
needs to be cleansed thoroughly. I think an agency should be _x000D_
put in charge of it that actually can control it. Also, I think _x000D_
the sources from which the information is obtained should be _x000D_
clarified. I think very strong regulations should be placed on _x000D_
the agencies that are distributing this information, because _x000D_
one of the regulations is verify the information before it is _x000D_
used. I was listed twice. No one ever contacted me. And of all _x000D_
the people that I have talked to, no one has ever contacted _x000D_
them._x000D_
    The first thing I would do immediately is develop a _x000D_
complete communications program for people, both living people _x000D_
that have been listed mistakenly and families of individuals _x000D_
that have been deceased and the deceased person has been used _x000D_
for tax fraud, identity theft, draining a bank account, et _x000D_
cetera. These people have nowhere to go either, and they hurt _x000D_
just as badly as I do. But there is not one website, there is _x000D_
not one place to call, there is no one that knows anything. I _x000D_
visited 18 separate Social Security offices. Out of those 18, _x000D_
only 12 knew what the Death Master File was. So even within the _x000D_
Social Security system, the word is not getting through. These _x000D_
people need to be trained to provide information."
2925279,2925278,2925280,19240,1,    Thank you.
2925280,2925279,2925281,19240,1,"    Senator Lankford, one question?"
2925281,2925280,2925282,19240,1,"    Just a point of interest for me. How did _x000D_
you prove you are alive? What documents did you have to bring _x000D_
and the final shift on it when you finally had the opportunity _x000D_
to be able to explain to someone, ``This is really me, I am _x000D_
still alive''? What were you asked to be able to show to verify _x000D_
that?"
2925282,2925281,2925283,19240,1,"    The Social Security Administration asks for _x000D_
your birth certificate, if you have it; driver's license with _x000D_
photo or photographic ID. They would like to have copies of _x000D_
invoices or correspondence that you have received either at _x000D_
your place of business or your home, copies of check stubs. _x000D_
Every single thing that you have that would identify you as you _x000D_
and prove that it is you. And they are very thorough going _x000D_
through that material._x000D_
    All of that same material I included in every package I _x000D_
sent out to every company I contacted."
2925283,2925282,2925284,19240,1,    OK. Thank you.
2925284,2925283,2925285,19240,1,"    Senator Peters, one question?"
2925285,2925284,2925286,19240,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Quite compelling testimony, Ms. Rivers. I also feel bad for _x000D_
you and apologize that you have gone through all of this. We _x000D_
have to get to the bottom of this. And I will say this is not _x000D_
the first time I have heard of this case. We actually had a _x000D_
case in Michigan earlier this year with a marine who was listed _x000D_
as dead twice and lost veterans' benefits and had the Treasury _x000D_
Department close his account, a whole host of difficulty. So, _x000D_
unfortunately, there are others that are in this situation, not _x000D_
just yourself._x000D_
    The question by far is the timeline. You mentioned in your _x000D_
testimony that in 2008 is when you learned that you were listed _x000D_
as dead. But you also mentioned that you went to the Social _x000D_
Security Administration, and they told you everything was OK, _x000D_
not to worry. Where was that in the sequence of events? And _x000D_
when did the record actually get cleared? Or is this something _x000D_
that you get constantly put back on the list? If you could _x000D_
clarify that for me, that would be helpful."
2925286,2925285,2925287,19240,1,"    OK. Let me step back and clarify one thing. I _x000D_
did not learn that I was deceased in 2008. 2008 was when the _x000D_
problem started happening, but I was not aware of what was _x000D_
causing it. That is what caused me to go to the Social Security _x000D_
office._x000D_
    The first time I found out that I had been listed as _x000D_
deceased was when, after my accident, the insurance company _x000D_
settled, I went to a new bank and opened an account. And they _x000D_
were happy to open an account and take my money. When I went _x000D_
back 3 days later to open a savings account, they ran me _x000D_
through the system. The bank manager came over and ran me _x000D_
through the system, and said, ``We cannot help you today.'' And _x000D_
I said, ``Why not?'' And she said, ``Because information we _x000D_
have reports you as deceased.'' I demanded to know who was _x000D_
reporting the information and also where it was coming from and _x000D_
supposedly what date I died. They absolutely refused to tell me _x000D_
anything. By laws and under FCRA, I thought that I was entitled _x000D_
to that information. However, the bank refused to give it to _x000D_
me, and later when I found our ChexSystems was the one that _x000D_
supplied that information, they still refused to provide me _x000D_
with anything._x000D_
    So April 2010 was when I actually found out I was on the _x000D_
Death Master File."
2925287,2925286,2925288,19240,1,"    And is that when you went to the Social _x000D_
Security Administration and----"
2925288,2925287,2925289,19240,1,    Again. I had already been----
2925289,2925288,2925290,19240,1,    Several times?
2925290,2925289,2925291,19240,1,"    Yes, sir."
2925291,2925290,2925292,19240,1,"    And several times you had gone, and they _x000D_
had told you repeatedly you were OK."
2925292,2925291,2925293,19240,1,    Each time.
2925293,2925292,2925294,19240,1,"    But it was clear you were not OK, as every _x000D_
time you turned around, it was not. So you were being given _x000D_
inaccurate information even though you were going into the _x000D_
office?"
2925294,2925293,2925295,19240,1,    Correct.
2925295,2925294,2925296,19240,1,    Very good. Thank you.
2925296,2925295,2925297,19240,1,"    Again, Ms. Rivers, thank you for your _x000D_
testimony. I think every Member of this Committee offers an _x000D_
apology and certainly our commitment that we are going to work _x000D_
with the people in the agencies to try and create law, create _x000D_
legislation that will prevent this from happening to another _x000D_
American. So thank you again for your testimony, and you are _x000D_
dismissed. Thank you."
2925297,2925296,2925298,19240,1,"    Thank you, sir."
2925298,2925297,2925299,19240,1,"    Our next witness will be Sean Brune. He _x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF THE HON. PATRICK P. O'CARROLL, JR.,\1\ INSPECTOR _x000D_
            GENERAL, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION"
2925300,2925299,2925301,19240,1,"    Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the _x000D_
invitation to participate in this discussion._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. O'Carroll appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 68._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    My office investigates hundreds of cases of Social Security _x000D_
number misuse every year, but recently one incident stood out _x000D_
from the rest. A man opened two bank accounts with Social _x000D_
Security numbers that belonged to people born in 1886 and 1893. _x000D_
We can safely assume these people, who today would be 129 and _x000D_
122 years of age, are deceased._x000D_
    However, according to SSA's database of Social Security _x000D_
number holders, these people are alive. They are living in the _x000D_
sense that SSA does not have dates of death for either person _x000D_
on their number holder records._x000D_
    Our auditors followed up and found out these two records _x000D_
were anything but unique. We recently reported that 6.5 million _x000D_
people whose Social Security records indicate that they are _x000D_
over 112 years old do not have a date of death on their Social _x000D_
Security number record. Without a date of death in SSA's _x000D_
database, these people do not appear on the agency's Death _x000D_
Master File._x000D_
    I should note that none of these aged number holders are _x000D_
improperly receiving Social Security benefits, and overpayments _x000D_
are not occurring. But these inaccuracies create a significant _x000D_
void in SSA's death data that is available to the public. We _x000D_
have recommended that SSA update the records and resolve the _x000D_
discrepancies we identified in our report._x000D_
    This audit is relevant to today's discussion on improper _x000D_
payments because benefit-paying agencies like HHS and the IRS, _x000D_
and other public and private entities, use the Death Master _x000D_
File to verify deaths and ensure payment accuracy._x000D_
    Additionally, as the Committee knows, the Improper Payments _x000D_
Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 included a Do _x000D_
Not Pay provision which requires Federal agencies to review _x000D_
lists of deceased or ineligible individuals before making _x000D_
payments. The Death Master File is one of those lists. To _x000D_
identify and prevent its own and other agencies' improper _x000D_
payments, SSA must collect and maintain accurate death records. _x000D_
It is equally important to ensure living individuals are not _x000D_
listed as deceased in SSA's records._x000D_
    There are less than 1,000 cases each month in which a _x000D_
living individual is mistakenly included on the Death Master _x000D_
File. SSA said it moves quickly to correct the situation when _x000D_
errors occur. The agency reports that it has not found _x000D_
conclusive evidence of past data misuse. However, we remain _x000D_
concerned because these errors can lead to premature benefit _x000D_
termination and Social Security underpayments and cause _x000D_
financial hardship and distress to those affected._x000D_
    I have addressed in my written statement recent actions _x000D_
that limit the sharing of personal information on SSA's death _x000D_
records and will delay the public release of death data through _x000D_
the Death Master File. We believe these actions could mitigate _x000D_
some of the issues I just mentioned._x000D_
    SSA must accurately process the death reports it receives _x000D_
to terminate payments to deceased beneficiaries and avoid _x000D_
overpayments. In several audits, we have estimated SSA has paid _x000D_
millions of dollars to beneficiaries after their deaths._x000D_
    Based on our audit work and recommendations, SSA now _x000D_
matches and corroborates its payment records with its number _x000D_
holder records every month and exchanges data with HHS to _x000D_
identify deceased beneficiaries based on their enrollment in, _x000D_
but non-usage of, Medicare. These initiatives have improved _x000D_
SSA's ability to process benefit terminations due to death, _x000D_
recover overpayments, and refer allegations of deceased payee _x000D_
fraud to our office._x000D_
    Last year, we investigated over 600 people for deceased _x000D_
payee fraud. These are cases of individuals who conceal _x000D_
someone's death to illegally collect their Social Security _x000D_
benefits, with criminal convictions of about 150 people and $55 _x000D_
million in recoveries, restitutions, and projected savings._x000D_
    In one example, a woman collected her mother's Social _x000D_
Security and Federal Civil Service benefits for 35 years after _x000D_
her mother died. SSA identified this case through the Medicare _x000D_
Non-Utilization Project and referred it to us to investigate. _x000D_
Last year, the woman pled guilty to government theft and was _x000D_
sentenced to 18 months of house arrest. She was ordered to _x000D_
repay about $350,000 to the SSA and OPM. This is a high _x000D_
investigative priority. Cases of deceased payee fraud can lead _x000D_
to significant government recoveries and savings, and Federal _x000D_
prosecution efforts help deter others from committing this _x000D_
crime._x000D_
    Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge that our auditors' _x000D_
and special agents' outstanding work on this topic has recently _x000D_
garnered national media attention. We are pleased that our _x000D_
efforts are making an impact and promoting overdue discussions _x000D_
on these issues. But I speak for my entire staff when I say we _x000D_
do not do this work to make news headlines. We do this work, _x000D_
and we will continue to do it to ensure the integrity of SSA's _x000D_
programs and to promote public confidence in Social Security _x000D_
and the Federal Government. This is and always will be our sole _x000D_
mission._x000D_
    We will continue to work with SSA and your Committee to _x000D_
address the issues discussed today. Thank you again for the _x000D_
invitation to testify, and I will be happy to answer any _x000D_
questions."

  TESTIMONY OF THE HON. DAVID MADER,\1\ CONTROLLER, OFFICE OF _x000D_
                     MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET"
2925302,2925301,2925303,19240,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee, for _x000D_
inviting me here today to discuss the Federal Government's _x000D_
ongoing efforts to prevent, reduce, and recapture improper _x000D_
payments. I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on _x000D_
this important topic. Our partnership with the Congress, _x000D_
consultation with GAO, and the important support of the IG _x000D_
community over the years has been vital to our efforts._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Mader appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 74._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Addressing improper payments is a central component of this _x000D_
administration's effort to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. _x000D_
When the President took office in 2009, the improper payment _x000D_
rate was 5.2 percent, an all-time high. Since then, the _x000D_
Administration, working together with the Congress, has made _x000D_
progress by strengthening the accountability and transparency _x000D_
through annual reviews by Inspectors General and expanded _x000D_
requirements for high-priority programs such as the requirement _x000D_
to report supplemental measures and program information on _x000D_
paymentaccuracy.gov. As a result of this concerted effort, in _x000D_
2013 we reported an improper rate of 3.53 percent._x000D_
    During fiscal year 2014, we experienced an improper payment _x000D_
rate increase in major programs including Medicare Fee-for-_x000D_
Service, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Medicaid, and _x000D_
Unemployment Insurance. Over the same period, other major _x000D_
programs experienced improper payment rate decreases, including _x000D_
Medicare Part C, the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance _x000D_
Program (SNAP), and Public Housing/Rental Assistance. As a net, _x000D_
these changes resulted in a governmentwide improper payment _x000D_
rate of 4.02 percent, or $125 billion. Notwithstanding this, _x000D_
agencies recovered roughly $20 billion in overpayments through _x000D_
payment recapture audits and other methods in 2014._x000D_
    While progress has been made over the years, the time has _x000D_
come for a more aggressive strategy to reduce the levels of _x000D_
improper payments that we currently are seeing. That is why the _x000D_
Administration has proposed to make a significant investment in _x000D_
activities to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent correctly, _x000D_
by expanding oversight activities in the largest benefit _x000D_
programs and increasing investments._x000D_
    Over the years the Administration has worked with the _x000D_
Congress on legislation regarding this topic, and these laws _x000D_
have provided agencies with new tools and techniques to _x000D_
prevent, reduce, and recover improper payments._x000D_
    The President's Fiscal Year 2016 budget provides the _x000D_
opportunity to build on this congressional support and _x000D_
administration activities to reduce improper payments. There is _x000D_
compelling evidence that investments in administrative _x000D_
resources can significantly decrease the rate of improper _x000D_
payments and recoup many times their initial investment._x000D_
    Examples of proposals in the fiscal year 2016 budget _x000D_
include: a robust package of Medicaid and Medicare program _x000D_
integrity proposals; strategic reinvestments in the IRS; a _x000D_
robust package of Social Security program integrity proposals; _x000D_
a proposal to expand the Department of Labor's initiative to _x000D_
conduct Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments and _x000D_
Reemployment Services; and improving further the accuracy of _x000D_
the Death Master File by sharing across multiple agencies._x000D_
    And this began long before we knew what the improper _x000D_
payment rate was going to be for the Office of Management and _x000D_
Budget issued an appendix to its circular on internal controls _x000D_
entitled, ``Requirements for Effective Estimation and _x000D_
Remediation of Improper Payments,'' and agencies were _x000D_
instructed to re-examine improper payment strategies on a _x000D_
number of fronts governmentwide. These new guidelines were _x000D_
issued in October 2014 and provide strategies for agencies and _x000D_
Inspectors General on key improper payments._x000D_
    In addition to these governmentwide initiatives, on _x000D_
February 26, 2015, the Director of OMB sent letters to agency _x000D_
heads in four organizations--Department of Labor (DOL), HHS, _x000D_
SSA, and Treasury--that have the largest priority programs. _x000D_
This direction requires the early implementation of the _x000D_
Appendix C requirements that I just mentioned by April 30 of _x000D_
this year._x000D_
    The direction further requires that each agency conduct the _x000D_
following analysis and present it to OMB: one, provide a _x000D_
comprehensive corrective action plan for each program in _x000D_
question; two, review new categories for reporting improper _x000D_
payments; and, three, provide analysis linking the agency _x000D_
efforts in establishing internal controls to the internal _x000D_
controls that they have for improper payments._x000D_
    Under this administration we have focused on the increased _x000D_
use of technology and sharing data to address improper _x000D_
payments. The effective use of data analytics also provides _x000D_
insight into methods of improving performance and _x000D_
decisionmaking capabilities._x000D_
    Examples of agencies currently using data analytics to _x000D_
prevent improper payments include the CMS' Fraud Prevention _x000D_
System and DOL's Integrity Center of Excellence._x000D_
    Improper payments remain a priority to this Administration. _x000D_
Although progress has been made, much more remains to be done, _x000D_
and we need your help. We look forward to working with the _x000D_
Congress to pass the President's 2016 budget, and we expect _x000D_
additional progress as we execute against our new improper _x000D_
payments guidance during this fiscal year._x000D_
    Thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify, and I _x000D_
look forward to your questions."

2925304,2925303,2925305,19240,1,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, Members _x000D_
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here _x000D_
today to discuss improper payments and the use of death data to _x000D_
prevent payments to deceased individuals._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Ms. Davis and Mr. Bertoni _x000D_
appears in the Appendix on page 80._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    In fiscal year 2014, Federal agencies estimated that _x000D_
improper payments totaled $124.7 billion. This represents a _x000D_
significant increase of almost $19 billion from the fiscal year _x000D_
2013 estimate. The increase can be attributed primarily to _x000D_
increased error rates in three major programs: Medicare Fee-_x000D_
for-Service, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. These _x000D_
three programs accounted for about 65 percent of the 2014 _x000D_
estimate._x000D_
    Nevertheless, improper payments are a governmentwide _x000D_
problem. The $124.7 billion estimate was attributable to 124 _x000D_
programs across 22 agencies. Twelve programs had estimates _x000D_
exceeding $1 billion. One large program, Temporary Assistance _x000D_
for Needy Families (TANF), with outlays of more than $16 _x000D_
billion, did not report an estimate, citing statutory _x000D_
limitations."
2925305,2925304,2925306,19240,1,"    Say that again, please."
2925306,2925305,2925307,19240,1,"    TANF, with outlays of more than $16 billion, did _x000D_
not report an estimate, citing statutory limitations._x000D_
    In the Financial Report of the U.S. Government for 2014, _x000D_
GAO reported the issue of improper payments as a material _x000D_
weakness in internal control because the Federal Government is _x000D_
unable to determine the full extent to which improper payments _x000D_
occur and reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken _x000D_
to reduce them._x000D_
    Inspectors General are required to report annually on their _x000D_
agencies' compliance with criteria in improper payments _x000D_
legislation. In December 2014, we reported that 10 agencies did _x000D_
not comply with all of the criteria for 2013, as reported by _x000D_
their Inspectors General. The two most common areas of _x000D_
noncompliance were publishing and meeting improper payment _x000D_
reduction targets and reporting error rates below 10 percent._x000D_
    There are a number of strategies that agencies can employ _x000D_
to reduce improper payments, including analyzing the root _x000D_
causes of improper payments in order to design and implement _x000D_
effective preventive controls._x000D_
    One major root cause for improper payments is insufficient _x000D_
documentation. For example, HHS reported this is a primary root _x000D_
cause of improper payments for home health claims in its fee-_x000D_
for-service program._x000D_
    Another driver for many programs, such as the Earned Income _x000D_
Tax Credit Program, is agencies' inability or failure to verify _x000D_
eligibility requirements, including recipient income or the _x000D_
number of dependents._x000D_
    One example of preventive controls to address underlying _x000D_
root causes is eligibility validation through sharing of data, _x000D_
such as the SSA death data. The Do Not Pay initiative is a Web-_x000D_
based centralized data matching service that allows agencies to _x000D_
review multiple databases, including certain death data _x000D_
maintained by SSA, to determine payment eligibility prior to _x000D_
making payments. SSA is uniquely positioned to collect and _x000D_
manage death data to help prevent improper payments at the _x000D_
Federal level._x000D_
    SSA maintains two sets of death data. Its full death file, _x000D_
which is only available to certain eligible entities, contains _x000D_
data from many sources, such as funeral directors, family _x000D_
members, other Federal agencies, and States. The Death Master _x000D_
File, which is available to the public, is a subset of the full _x000D_
file because it does not contain death data from States._x000D_
    While reviewing death data can be a useful tool for _x000D_
agencies, there are opportunities for SSA to improve the _x000D_
accuracy and completeness of these data. We have reported that _x000D_
SSA's procedures for collecting, verifying, and maintaining _x000D_
death reports could result in untimely or erroneous death data._x000D_
    For example, we reported in November 2013 that SSA did not _x000D_
independently verify death reports for all Social Security _x000D_
beneficiaries or any non-beneficiaries before including them in _x000D_
death records._x000D_
    When data is not verified, there is an increased risk that _x000D_
such data will be inaccurate or incomplete. This can result in _x000D_
other Federal benefit-paying agencies using these data to make _x000D_
improper payments._x000D_
    In our November 2013, we identified several types of errors _x000D_
with SSA's death data. For example, we found instances of _x000D_
records where the date of death preceded the date of birth and _x000D_
records showing recorded ages at death between 115 and 195 _x000D_
years of age._x000D_
    We recommended that SSA conduct a risk assessment to _x000D_
identify the scope and extent of these types of errors, ways to _x000D_
address them, and the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of _x000D_
doing so._x000D_
    Our report also noted that SSA lacked written guidelines _x000D_
for determining agency eligibility to access the full death _x000D_
file. We recommended that SSA develop and publicize guidance to _x000D_
more systematically determine access eligibility and, thus, _x000D_
better inform agencies as to when they might be eligible for _x000D_
access to more complete death data._x000D_
    Because death data can be a useful tool in data matching to _x000D_
prevent improper payments, continuing efforts are needed to _x000D_
help minimize the risks posed by inaccurate and incomplete _x000D_
death data and ensure that agencies receive appropriate access _x000D_
to these data._x000D_
    As a final point, we would like to emphasize that with _x000D_
outlays from major programs expected to increase, it is _x000D_
critical that actions are taken to reduce improper payments. _x000D_
There are considerable opportunities for agencies' auditors and _x000D_
other members of the accountability community to work together _x000D_
with Congress in ensuring that taxpayers' dollars are _x000D_
adequately safeguarded and used for their intended purposes._x000D_
    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, Members of the _x000D_
Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I, along with _x000D_
my colleague, Mr. Bertoni, who does work on the Death Master _x000D_
File, are happy to answer any questions."
2925307,2925306,2925308,19240,1,"    Thank you, Ms. Davis. I was actually _x000D_
going to point out the fact that Mr. Bertoni has joined the _x000D_
panel here. He is the Director of GAO's Education, Workforce, _x000D_
and Income Security team, and he might assist in answering _x000D_
questions._x000D_
    I will start questions with Mr. Brune. Prior to coming here _x000D_
today, did you take a look at Ms. Rivers' case just to find out _x000D_
exactly what the status is with her current status?"
2925308,2925307,2925309,19240,1,"    Fair enough. How many people are you _x000D_
aware of are in Ms. Rivers' position?"
2925309,2925308,2925310,19240,1,"    So the name may be removed from the Death _x000D_
Master File, but the effects continue to linger, correct? Can _x000D_
you just describe what happens there with credit agencies and _x000D_
banks and credit card companies?"
2925310,2925309,2925311,19240,1,"    So how often do you update your Death _x000D_
Master File with Commerce?"
2925311,2925310,2925312,19240,1,"    Weekly. And how often are the commercial _x000D_
entities required, supposedly, to update those files?"
2925312,2925311,2925313,19240,1,"    Can you describe how somebody who is _x000D_
listed on the Death Master File, how identity thiefs can create _x000D_
fraud with those names? I can understand the Master File is _x000D_
published and people can quickly try and claim a tax refund _x000D_
with that Social Security number, which is why now the law _x000D_
states that that information is going to be held for 3 years. _x000D_
But how else is that fraud committed?"
2925313,2925312,2925314,19240,1,    Mr. O'Carroll.
2925314,2925313,2925315,19240,1,"    Yes, Chairman. One of the ways that we are _x000D_
finding that the fraudsters are doing it is they will go to one _x000D_
record that is out there, for example, a State record listing _x000D_
all the deceased people in it. And then they will go, and they _x000D_
will take a look at the Death Master File and see if a person _x000D_
is alive in one record and then dead in the other record. And _x000D_
then what they will do is they will claim to be that person and _x000D_
then go after their benefits. So that is one method of it._x000D_
    And as we know, in other cases, they will adopt the name _x000D_
and the information of the person and then file for credit and _x000D_
default."
2925315,2925314,2925316,19240,1,"    Mr. Brune, is there a law that prevents _x000D_
you from doing this? Why do not we just purge the Death Master _x000D_
File from anybody over a certain age?"
2925316,2925315,2925317,19240,1,"    Mr. O'Carroll, we are talking about how _x000D_
many people over 112 that you identified?"
2925317,2925316,2925318,19240,1,"    6.5 million, Chairman."
2925318,2925317,2925319,19240,1,"    Right. On the Numident file, correct? _x000D_
That is where we need to purge these."
2925319,2925318,2925320,19240,1,    Yes.
2925320,2925319,2925321,19240,1,"    This is where we want to put in a date of _x000D_
death, basically, correct?"
2925321,2925320,2925322,19240,1,    Correct.
2925322,2925321,2925323,19240,1,"    But how many people actually are living _x000D_
today that are over 112?"
2925323,2925322,2925324,19240,1,"    Well, in one of SSA's databases it will show _x000D_
them as deceased, and then in another database it will show _x000D_
them alive, and there are 1.4 million of them. And we have not _x000D_
set any number in terms of the actual living. We use the _x000D_
estimate similar to Mr. Brune's of about 1,000 a month living _x000D_
people are listed on the Death Master File."
2925324,2925323,2925325,19240,1,"    But, again, those would be much younger _x000D_
people, so I am still not getting a good answer to my question. _x000D_
Why do not we just purge the Numident--or list on the Numident _x000D_
a date of death for people that are over--I do not know, let us _x000D_
start with 150. Then maybe next month we knock it down to 140, _x000D_
then 130, and have some protection for somebody that just _x000D_
might--again, when we are talking about 6.5 million records out _x000D_
there, obviously there are about 6.499999 million of those _x000D_
people that really are dead and are not going to be affected by _x000D_
this. But why do not we do that to prevent the type of fraud _x000D_
that this type of situation occurs or allows?"
2925325,2925324,2925326,19240,1,"    Well, correct, Chairman, on that. One of our _x000D_
recommendations is just as you are saying with purging it. One _x000D_
thought is that SSA could just make a notation on each of those _x000D_
files of people over 112 years of age like they do for other _x000D_
reasons. If you have to get a replacement Social Security _x000D_
number as a battered spouse, for security reasons, they put a _x000D_
notation or a SPINCODE and it shows that you have two Social _x000D_
Security numbers. What we are recommending is that they just _x000D_
put a record like that on all the people over 112 years of age, _x000D_
so that way, one, it would reflect the SSN as inactive but _x000D_
also, if accidentally somebody who had a birth date of, let us _x000D_
say, 1957 and it was keyed in as 1857, when they realize that _x000D_
they are losing benefits, it would be easy for SSA to remove _x000D_
the code."
2925326,2925325,2925327,19240,1,"    So can the Social Security Administration _x000D_
do that themselves administratively, or do you need Congress to _x000D_
pass a law to allow that to happen?"
2925327,2925326,2925328,19240,1,"    When you complete your analysis and you _x000D_
need a legislative fix for this, please come to us as quickly _x000D_
as possible. Senator Carper."
2925328,2925327,2925329,19240,1,"    Thanks very much. Again, our thanks to all _x000D_
of you. Mr. Bertoni, nice of you to join us. We appreciate it. _x000D_
I am going to ask you a question. We are not going to let you _x000D_
just sit here and just look good."
2925329,2925328,2925330,19240,1,"    We are going to ask you to give us some _x000D_
good advice._x000D_
    I want to go back a little bit in time. I never thought _x000D_
much of improper payments until 2002, and I think it was a _x000D_
House member who proposed that we at least start requiring _x000D_
agencies to note what improper payments are and, second, begin _x000D_
reporting them. And every year after that, 2003, 2004, 2005, I _x000D_
noticed there was an increase in the level of improper _x000D_
payments, and I did not feel good about it because the number _x000D_
just kept going up. And somebody finally said, well, the reason _x000D_
why they are going up is more and more agencies are actually _x000D_
getting on board and beginning to report improper payments._x000D_
    I am still not convinced the Department of Defense fully _x000D_
reports their improper payments. You may be a better judge of _x000D_
that than I am._x000D_
    But around 2010, we reached a point where Dr. Coburn and I _x000D_
sensed that maybe most of the lion's share of agencies were _x000D_
actually reporting their improper payments. And we added a _x000D_
reform. Not only did we want agencies to figure out--to record _x000D_
their improper payments, and report them. That was the 2002 _x000D_
law. We said we also want the agencies to stop making improper _x000D_
payments. We also said we want them to the extent they can _x000D_
recover monies, we wanted them to recover monies._x000D_
    Did somebody report that last year--I thought I heard $20 _x000D_
billion was recovered."
2925330,2925329,2925331,19240,1,"    $20 billion, sir."
2925331,2925330,2925332,19240,1,"    $20 billion. That is a good amount of _x000D_
money. And our next step was to say we want to help the _x000D_
administration on Do Not Pay, the Do Not Pay list, which was _x000D_
part of, I think, our 2012 legislation._x000D_
    Last Congress, we tried to go further and go after payments _x000D_
to dead people and that sort of thing. And we did not get our _x000D_
legislation through the House, because of the objection of one _x000D_
Subcommittee within the Ways and Means Committee, and so we are _x000D_
going to take another run at it._x000D_
    I was stunned when I saw the number, the improper payments _x000D_
number, for 2014, because we had seen during a number of years _x000D_
that the number was going down beginning in 2010, 2011, 2012, _x000D_
2013. And then it pops up by about $20 billion in 2014._x000D_
    Our friend Mr. Mader has given us, I think, a very good to-_x000D_
do list--I mentioned this to the Chairman--a very good to-do _x000D_
list on, I think, pages 2 and 3 of his testimony. I will not go _x000D_
through it all, but it involves program integrity work in a _x000D_
variety of areas. And it involves actually spending some money _x000D_
at the IRS to give them the tools that they need. I think we _x000D_
have a lot of people who do work on the Earned Income Tax _x000D_
Credit filings. I think about two-thirds to three-fourths of _x000D_
the people who help people file for the EITC are people that _x000D_
are not CPAs. They might be very good people, but they are not _x000D_
really regulated by the Treasury. They may not have the kind of _x000D_
credentials that we might hope._x000D_
    I want you to drill down on that point. There is a lot of _x000D_
talk here, a lot of important discussion on the Social Security _x000D_
aspects of this and paying people that are dead and having _x000D_
folks listed that are 150 years old. I want you to drill down _x000D_
for us on the EITC. I want you to drill down on the credentials _x000D_
of the folks that are literally helping most people file for _x000D_
the EITC and what the problem is here and what we should do _x000D_
about it."
2925332,2925331,2925333,19240,1,"    Thank you, Senator. Well, I think----"
2925333,2925332,2925334,19240,1,"    Because it is a lot of money. As I recall, _x000D_
it is a lot of money."
2925334,2925333,2925335,19240,1,"    It is a lot of money, and I think it is _x000D_
important to at least step back and remember that the Earned _x000D_
Income Tax Credit Program was passed under President Reagan _x000D_
back years and years ago."
2925335,2925334,2925336,19240,1,"    I think he called it the ``best anti-_x000D_
poverty program in the country,'' and he was probably right."
2925336,2925335,2925337,19240,1,"    And last year, actually 26 million American _x000D_
families benefited from that program, so I think it is a _x000D_
program that over the decades has proven its value. And I _x000D_
think, Senator, you touched on--and, actually, Ms. Davis _x000D_
touched on it, too. It is a program that has a high degree of _x000D_
complexity in that it is really based on claiming dependent _x000D_
children at a certain income level. And, with separations, with _x000D_
divorces, establishing the custodial parent, making that _x000D_
determination, and then also as Ms. Davis testified, actually _x000D_
verifying the income when you are making that credit adds to _x000D_
the complexity of that program._x000D_
    But I think you touched on an area that the Administration _x000D_
has been asking for help of the Congress over the last couple _x000D_
years, and that is the fact that well over 50 percent of these _x000D_
26 million EITC payments are actually done by third-party _x000D_
providers who are not CPAs, they are not enrolled agents, they _x000D_
are not individuals who are authorized to actually represent _x000D_
you or I in front of the Internal Revenue Service. They are _x000D_
just preparers._x000D_
    And having dealt with this issue for a number of years at _x000D_
the IRS, I am struck by the fact that as a society we seem to _x000D_
register, regulate, and license electricians and plumbers and _x000D_
health care workers, yet we do not want to regulate individuals _x000D_
who actually have a partnership with the IRS in administering _x000D_
the tax administration and this important credit in a very fair _x000D_
way--fair to the taxpayers and fair to the government._x000D_
    So I think in the President's budget he once again asks for _x000D_
a series of initiatives, whether it be resources or some _x000D_
assistance in regulating and licensing these preparers."
2925337,2925336,2925338,19240,1,"    I would just say to my colleagues, I would _x000D_
just invite their attention to your testimony, and I think it _x000D_
maybe starts on pages 2 and 3. But it says, ``Examples of _x000D_
proposals that are in the 2006 budget include,'' and you give _x000D_
us five or six really good ideas for--I call it a ``to-do _x000D_
list.'' I like to say GAO gives us a good to-do list every _x000D_
other year, the high-risk list, and you have given us a really _x000D_
good to-do list, and I hope we take it seriously. I plan to._x000D_
    Let me just ask each of you, starting with you, Mr. _x000D_
Bertoni, you heard this other testimony. You heard the _x000D_
testimony of the opening witness. Give us one thing--say if you _x000D_
do nothing else, Committee, Senate, do this to address this _x000D_
problem."
2925338,2925337,2925339,19240,1,"    Good. Thank you very much, all of you."
2925339,2925338,2925340,19240,1,    Senator Lankford.
2925340,2925339,2925341,19240,1,"    Thank you. Thank you all for being here. _x000D_
I will get a chance to talk through several things._x000D_
    Let me just make a quick comment, Social Security _x000D_
Administration. This has been an ongoing issue for a while that _x000D_
several of us have talked about dealing with Social Security _x000D_
disability. I know this Committee for a while has dealt with _x000D_
it. I have dealt with it for quite a while as well. I have a _x000D_
letter that is still outstanding with SSA dealing with the _x000D_
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from February of last year _x000D_
dealing with just getting a full record, medical record that _x000D_
has to be submitted. I am not going to bring that up today, but _x000D_
just saying that is a letter that is outstanding. We know that _x000D_
that is coming, are still watching for that and anticipating _x000D_
that to be able to come soon. So I am not going to try to ask _x000D_
you a question directly because that is not related to this _x000D_
hearing, but I did want to tell you we are still waiting._x000D_
    Mr. Mader, let me ask you a question. Is the Social _x000D_
Security Administration the right place to be able to manage _x000D_
the Death Master File? It seems like that has kind of grown up _x000D_
organically as a place that is going to be gathered. Is that _x000D_
the right spot, according to OMB? Or is there a better place to _x000D_
be able to manage that file?"
2925341,2925340,2925342,19240,1,"    Senator, we believe that Social Security is the _x000D_
organization that is best suited to collect this data, and I _x000D_
think as my two colleagues from Social Security have testified, _x000D_
they are receiving the information both directly from families, _x000D_
from funeral homes, from States, but I think what we have is a _x000D_
process and a system that needs to be expanded. As both _x000D_
gentlemen testified, we do not have every State that has access _x000D_
in using the electronic system, which clearly improves the _x000D_
quality of the data._x000D_
    So I think a lot of the fixes that we talked about today _x000D_
need to be put in place."
2925342,2925341,2925343,19240,1,"    But fixable in that current structure and _x000D_
leave it in SSA?"
2925343,2925342,2925344,19240,1,"    Yes, I believe so. Yes, sir."
2925344,2925343,2925345,19240,1,"    The Social Security Administration, do _x000D_
they feel like this is part of their mission to be able to keep _x000D_
up this file, this is important? Because obviously it is being _x000D_
shared with multiple agencies, multiple entities are looking to _x000D_
the Social Security Administration to get that information."
2925345,2925344,2925346,19240,1,"    But is that something the agency sells at _x000D_
this point? What is the asset there?"
2925346,2925345,2925347,19240,1,"    OK. Is there a cost to that from Commerce _x000D_
or a cost to Commerce or to other agencies that they pay to be _x000D_
able to get that information?"
2925347,2925346,2925348,19240,1,    OK. What about to private entities?
2925348,2925347,2925349,19240,1,"    Does that come back to the Social _x000D_
Security Administration to reimburse them? Or----"
2925349,2925348,2925350,19240,1,"    OK. Do States charge us to be able to get _x000D_
that information?"
2925350,2925349,2925351,19240,1,    Yes.
2925351,2925350,2925352,19240,1,"    But when you get the death information _x000D_
from States, do they charge the Social Security Administration _x000D_
for that information?"
2925352,2925351,2925353,19240,1,"    That is what I am asking. So then how _x000D_
much are we paying the States for that?"
2925353,2925352,2925354,19240,1,"    So give me an approximate cost there? We _x000D_
are talking $3 a person to be able to get that information----"
2925354,2925353,2925355,19240,1,"    And then what does SSA do with that then _x000D_
to be able to verify? It has not been verified. You bought the _x000D_
information for $1 from the States. Then is it $2 cost to be _x000D_
able to go and verify those records?"
2925355,2925354,2925356,19240,1,"    OK. So then once it is processed, is _x000D_
there a public and an internal on this Death Master File? I am _x000D_
trying to figure out the process here. We are now paying to get _x000D_
the records. We are selling those to Commerce who is then _x000D_
selling it to agencies and other private individuals to recoup _x000D_
the cost here. We have a lot of money and a lot of names that _x000D_
are moving at this spot and to be able to verify that. So once _x000D_
we go through the verification--how much does it cost to verify _x000D_
someone that is a non-verified name coming from a State?"
2925356,2925355,2925357,19240,1,"    Is there an average cost? I am sure that _x000D_
it is going to cost more for others, but does SSA have an _x000D_
average cost on that?"
2925357,2925356,2925358,19240,1,"    OK. According to the OIG report--and I _x000D_
want to be able to ask you about this, Mr. O'Carroll found _x000D_
180,000 individuals who died while receiving disability _x000D_
payments but were not recorded in the Death Master File. _x000D_
Obviously, they are already in the Social Security disability _x000D_
process as well. There were e-verify requests for those _x000D_
deceased individuals and more than 90 voter registrations in _x000D_
that group that were already dead._x000D_
    So help me understand this process. As you see it at this _x000D_
point, we have verified records from States. SSA is verifying _x000D_
them when they are coming in, yet we have 6.5 million that are _x000D_
over 112 years old, and we have individuals that are on Social _x000D_
Security disability, 180,000 individuals that you found that _x000D_
are already dead."
2925358,2925357,2925359,19240,1,"    Well, Senator, that is our biggest concern _x000D_
when we take a look at living people over 112 years of age, _x000D_
when we did our audit on it, there were 13 people in the United _x000D_
States. By the time we finished our audit, there were 109. And _x000D_
we figured there are about 35 people over 112 in the whole _x000D_
world._x000D_
    So, anyway, all those valid Social Security numbers that _x000D_
are out there, if somebody takes those numbers, then they can _x000D_
start misusing them, and our biggest concern on it, is that _x000D_
they will be ending up using--our concern on it is that when _x000D_
that information gets out there, somebody can impersonate _x000D_
another person, they can vote, they can get driver's licenses, _x000D_
et cetera."
2925359,2925358,2925360,19240,1,"    So are these names that have never been _x000D_
submitted by a State so they have not been verified by SSA _x000D_
because no one has ever turned those names up the first time?"
2925360,2925359,2925361,19240,1,"    Most of the 112 are from years ago, back in _x000D_
the 1970s, when people came in and reported themselves----"
2925361,2925360,2925362,19240,1,"    What about these on disability, that you _x000D_
found these individuals that are already deceased that are also _x000D_
on the disability roll?"
2925362,2925361,2925363,19240,1,"    We are finding with that issue on it--we are _x000D_
finding people that are listed as deceased and getting _x000D_
benefits. The Numident, which is the record that we are talking _x000D_
about today, the one that is used for the Death Master File, is _x000D_
one file at SSA. And then the other file, the Master _x000D_
Beneficiary Record, is another file. So when somebody calls in _x000D_
and says that there is a deceased person, to immediately stop _x000D_
the benefits from going out, SSA puts it right on the payment _x000D_
record and stops it. But they may not put it on the Numident--_x000D_
and Sean could probably describe it a little bit better. It _x000D_
gets confusing when you are talking auxiliaries and different _x000D_
things like that. So then the Numident does not list the person _x000D_
as being deceased, and that is where the big issue is. Two _x000D_
different records."
2925363,2925362,2925364,19240,1,"    And they are opening bank accounts, they _x000D_
are voting. All these different things that you found as you _x000D_
went through this process on these false Social Security _x000D_
numbers then are people that have died or their number is still _x000D_
being used."
2925364,2925363,2925365,19240,1,"    Correct. And it gets even more complicated _x000D_
in terms of that--as I said before, when somebody knows that _x000D_
SSA thinks that a person is alive, but they know the person is _x000D_
dead, they might even try to get Social Security benefits."
2925365,2925364,2925366,19240,1,"    OK. I have exceeded my time. I yield _x000D_
back."
2925366,2925365,2925367,19240,1,    Senator Peters.
2925367,2925366,2925368,19240,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Thank you for your testimony, and after listening to Ms. _x000D_
Rivers, we have raised a lot of interesting issues here today._x000D_
    As I mentioned to Ms. Rivers after she testified, this is _x000D_
not an unusual situation that I have run against given the fact _x000D_
that we had a marine veteran in Michigan just recently that was _x000D_
highlighted in the media for his trials and tribulations _x000D_
related to the fact that he was improperly listed as being _x000D_
deceased a couple times, to the point of losing his Veterans _x000D_
Affairs benefits; the Treasury Department shut down his bank _x000D_
account; his credit score was ruined as well when he was trying _x000D_
to purchase a house, and it took him several months to get _x000D_
through that process. And so this is an anguishing issue for _x000D_
many folks, and you mentioned, Mr. Brune, that about 9,000 _x000D_
individuals you believe each year are in this situation?"
2925368,2925367,2925369,19240,1,"    So my question is: How do they get on that _x000D_
list? Of those 9,000, what is usually the event that is _x000D_
triggering them getting on that list?"
2925369,2925368,2925370,19240,1,    The reporter?
2925370,2925369,2925371,19240,1,"    So a report from the Postal Service. You _x000D_
are not getting a death certificate. You are having the Postal _x000D_
Service saying, someone did not get their mail?"
2925371,2925370,2925372,19240,1,"    So you would not just say, a person is not _x000D_
collecting their mail, let us put them on the death list?"
2925372,2925371,2925373,19240,1,"    How long does it take to fix these, _x000D_
normally? Do you have any kind of analysis of those 9,000 _x000D_
individuals?"
2925373,2925372,2925374,19240,1,"    But the problem is that even if that is _x000D_
done, then the information is not Proactively communicated to _x000D_
the commercial vendors, banks, others that may want this _x000D_
information, which I think Ms. Rivers was in that trouble. Is _x000D_
there a way to do that proactively? Because otherwise, we are _x000D_
just relying on the service to go back and constantly check the _x000D_
list, and oftentimes, an individual does not know they are on _x000D_
this list as well._x000D_
    They just are having a situation like Ms. Rivers has, that _x000D_
things are not going well, and even though there is seemingly _x000D_
no explanation for it, and yet there is no proactive measures _x000D_
on the part of the Social Security Administration to say, we _x000D_
made a mistake. We have to try to fix it for this individual _x000D_
because we know this individual is going to be going through an _x000D_
awful lot of heartache."
2925374,2925373,2925375,19240,1,"    Now, going to the, which I think is the _x000D_
other fascinating part of this hearing, are the 6.5 million _x000D_
people at 112 years old. Mr. O'Carroll, now, in your testimony, _x000D_
you said these folks are not receiving Social Security _x000D_
payments; they just simply still have a valid Social Security _x000D_
number out there, and that there is no data in terms of date of _x000D_
death._x000D_
    At some point, these individuals probably received Social _x000D_
Security checks and then they stopped getting Social Security. _x000D_
Why does not that trigger something? If not picking up your _x000D_
mail is enough to get you on the list, what stopped them, once _x000D_
they stopped receiving a Social Security check, we can probably _x000D_
assume they are no longer alive."
2925375,2925374,2925376,19240,1,"    Well, the interesting part, Senator Peters, _x000D_
is that many of these are from the 1970s when people were _x000D_
coming into SSA offices and saying a person had died who was _x000D_
not getting benefits at the time, a family member, a widow, _x000D_
children, or dependents like that, that is where a lot of these _x000D_
records were created._x000D_
    So the person did not have the benefit from SSA, was not of _x000D_
record with SSA, and that is pretty much the crux the problem. _x000D_
They are old records with little ways for SSA to catch it."
2925376,2925375,2925377,19240,1,"    Because they never were receiving a check--_x000D_
--"
2925377,2925376,2925378,19240,1,"    Correct._x000D_
it is the 112-year figure? What is the situation of 100-year-_x000D_
old individuals and 105-year-old individuals and 110? Is there _x000D_
something about 112?"
2925378,2925377,2925379,19240,1,"    What happened was is that we had gotten word _x000D_
from a financial institution that the two accounts were set up, _x000D_
which is in my testimony. But anyway, at that point, our _x000D_
auditors looked and they figured out what was the highest age _x000D_
of record, and that is where we came up with 112. And as I _x000D_
said, there are about 35 people in the world that are 112."
2925379,2925378,2925380,19240,1,"    But do you see these same kind of numbers _x000D_
of someone who is 105 years old, a large number?"
2925380,2925379,2925381,19240,1,"    Well, what is interesting on that one is, is _x000D_
that what SSA had been doing and we do is that when a person _x000D_
reached 100 years of age, they would reach out to try to verify _x000D_
that the person was there. That was called the Centenarian _x000D_
Project. We were getting fairly good information on that. We _x000D_
were saving about $8 million a year by doing that._x000D_
    I mentioned in my testimony--it would make more sense to _x000D_
start taking a look at people who are not using Medicare for _x000D_
long periods of time in that age group. So then we had two _x000D_
criteria, the age and the fact that they were not seeing a _x000D_
doctor. And in that group there, we are seeing about four or _x000D_
five times better results than we were getting by just using _x000D_
the age limit._x000D_
    But yes, everybody is aware of that and we keep taking a _x000D_
look. We have had different projects that we have worked with _x000D_
SSA looking at, as an example, 90-year-olds."
2925381,2925380,2925382,19240,1,"    And where are we on the Medicare project? _x000D_
How many of those records are--and what is the cutoff for _x000D_
Medicare? How long without benefits of Medicare?"
2925382,2925381,2925383,19240,1,"    We have been using 3 years on that one. That _x000D_
seems fairly good. In fact, what we are looking at right now, _x000D_
because it has been so successful, we are doing an audit, _x000D_
taking a look at Medicaid and see if we can also identify _x000D_
additional deceased people that way."
2925383,2925382,2925384,19240,1,    Thank you so much.
2925384,2925383,2925385,19240,1,    Senator McCaskill.
2925385,2925384,2925386,19240,1,"    Thank you. Last year during a hearing on _x000D_
this subject, I learned that we were selling these lists to _x000D_
other government agencies, which is hard for me to wrap my arms _x000D_
around that policy, and I think we were told by Ms. LaCanfora _x000D_
that this was required by law. Is that correct?"
2925386,2925385,2925387,19240,1,"    So let us assume that we could do _x000D_
something legislatively. Would you see any reason why we could _x000D_
not put a secure website up with this information that was _x000D_
properly encrypted and properly pass-coded that would share _x000D_
this information? I mean, we have hundreds of millions of _x000D_
dollars going out the door at other agencies and they are _x000D_
trying to budget paying you for information._x000D_
    I mean, all of this is being gathered in the public domain. _x000D_
It seems bizarre to me that we are not focusing on a priority _x000D_
of a policy that would make this information available to _x000D_
others easily and at as little expense as possible since the _x000D_
taxpayers are paying the bill no matter where this is _x000D_
occurring."
2925387,2925386,2925388,19240,1,"    Well, it would be great if we could get _x000D_
that done. OK. Now, here is the other thing that really gets _x000D_
me. If you get data in, you are putting it in the system and _x000D_
selling it without verifying it if there is not an SSA _x000D_
recipient, correct?"
2925388,2925387,2925389,19240,1,"    So you get a record and you put it in _x000D_
the system for another agency to buy, but because it is not an _x000D_
SSA recipient, you are not going to the trouble of verifying?"
2925389,2925388,2925390,19240,1,"    So is it clearly delineated to them what _x000D_
records are verified and what are not?"
2925390,2925389,2925391,19240,1,"    Now, are they, to your knowledge, maybe _x000D_
the IG would know or maybe GAO would know, are these other _x000D_
agencies then going and verifying? Mr. Bertoni."
2925391,2925390,2925392,19240,1,"    Well, what if they wanted to pay you to _x000D_
verify it? Could you not verify them all and then just charge _x000D_
them for it? You are already charging them for it."
2925392,2925391,2925393,19240,1,"    So the law would have to be changed in _x000D_
order for you to verify everything?"
2925393,2925392,2925394,19240,1,    No? Daniel says no.
2925394,2925393,2925395,19240,1,    OK.
2925395,2925394,2925396,19240,1,"    Have you figured out what it would cost _x000D_
you to verify them and then recover those costs when you sell _x000D_
them?"
2925396,2925395,2925397,19240,1,"    Would that not make sense if you are in _x000D_
the business of verifying? So it seems like to me you guys are _x000D_
doing this verification and you know what it costs you because _x000D_
you are charging people for it, but you are not doing it--if _x000D_
there is not an SSA recipient and then that agency is getting _x000D_
it, which heightens the likelihood of an improper payment."
2925397,2925396,2925398,19240,1,"    I completely get that, but you _x000D_
understand the common sense argument. Tell me you do."
2925398,2925397,2925399,19240,1,    OK. Good.
2925399,2925398,2925400,19240,1,"    OK. I just got worried for a minute. _x000D_
Senator Ayotte and I have a bill, Senator Coburn and I had a _x000D_
bill. This is an agency, we call it, let me Google that for _x000D_
you, because this is an agency that the vast majority of the _x000D_
information that they are supposed to be distributing is easily _x000D_
available online, and they are the distribution source for your _x000D_
public death master file._x000D_
    Have you all given some thought, if we get rid of the _x000D_
National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which we should _x000D_
because it is a waste of money, what your alternative _x000D_
distribution method would be?"
2925400,2925399,2925401,19240,1,"    And the money goes into a revolving fund _x000D_
which keeps them in existence, which we get back to the _x000D_
beginning which is, this is agency which has outgrown its _x000D_
usefulness and purpose, and for some reason, we have a really _x000D_
hard time shutting down agencies like that. So I am determined, _x000D_
and I think most of my colleagues on this Committee share my _x000D_
determination about this agency._x000D_
    So I would think you should begin pricing out what NTIS is _x000D_
making off selling your lists. Maybe you could use that money _x000D_
to verify for the other agencies."
2925401,2925400,2925402,19240,1,    Thank you.
2925402,2925401,2925403,19240,1,"    We will be supportive of that effort. _x000D_
Senator Ayotte."
2925403,2925402,2925404,19240,1,"    Yes. Let me just say that I completely, _x000D_
wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Senator McCaskill, on _x000D_
this. So I wanted to ask, just to understand this information _x000D_
sharing piece, in order for you to share information, it sounds _x000D_
to me, because of the limitations that are put on what you can _x000D_
do with regard to the trust fund, that we are going to need _x000D_
some legislative action there to have a broader information _x000D_
sharing across agencies, correct?"
2925404,2925403,2925405,19240,1,"    But as I also understand it, that we are _x000D_
also, as we look at this challenge that we are facing in terms _x000D_
of the DMF list, this issue, we are also not sharing among _x000D_
States, right? So do States share with us? I know they are _x000D_
sharing with us in terms of vital records, we have heard, but _x000D_
do we share with States what we know?"
2925405,2925404,2925406,19240,1,    Of any kind?
2925406,2925405,2925407,19240,1,"    OK. And so, one of the things that just _x000D_
seems, as I look at this whole thing, as we look, we are not _x000D_
communicating amongst each other, and then there is also the _x000D_
amount of money that is at stake here. A lot of us talk about _x000D_
wanting to address sequester. We could do it if we got improper _x000D_
payments to a much more reduced level._x000D_
    These resources that we are talking about, whether it is to _x000D_
defend the Nation or NIH or all the things that we would like _x000D_
to do, I mean, this is very big money. And so, I am looking at _x000D_
this thinking, How do we also not only share information with _x000D_
each other, what steps do we need to take to verify it further? _x000D_
And then there is a lot of publicly available information, it _x000D_
seems like, we are leaving on the table to help verify for us._x000D_
    I mean, I would love to get certainly Mr. O'Carroll and Ms. _x000D_
Davis's impression. Is there not some publicly available _x000D_
information that we are not necessarily cross-checking with?"
2925407,2925406,2925408,19240,1,"    That is correct, Senator. What we did was an _x000D_
audit a few years ago and in the audit, we went to SSA and we _x000D_
looked at a sample of 58 records that were suspended showing _x000D_
that no payment was going out for some reason of caution. And _x000D_
then we went through the 58 and we found that 57 were deceased. _x000D_
And the way we found it was, it was probably in about thirds. _x000D_
For one-third of them, SSA had been able to find out about, had _x000D_
the information in their records, and it was just a question of _x000D_
cleaning it up._x000D_
    And then for another one-third, we were able to get death _x000D_
certificates from the States and other ways like that. And then _x000D_
for the other third, we used other databases that were _x000D_
available just to identify the person as deceased and be able _x000D_
to get the information that way. So yes, I find third-party _x000D_
databases are very useful."
2925408,2925407,2925409,19240,1,"    So do we need legislative proposals--in _x000D_
order to incorporate information that is already available and _x000D_
third-party information, and also when I heard Mr. O'Carroll's _x000D_
example, I also think that apparently the States, what they are _x000D_
doing, is submitting the vital statistics to the Social _x000D_
Security Administration. Apparently it does not have the same _x000D_
level of accuracy as it should, too._x000D_
    So do you need legislative proposals to be able to consult _x000D_
third-party information or is it a resource issue or is it all _x000D_
of the above? And also, what is it that we need to do from the _x000D_
States' perspective? If we knew that you could get the death _x000D_
certificate for certain individuals, apparently their vital _x000D_
records office would have not submitted that if it did not get _x000D_
into your system properly."
2925409,2925408,2925410,19240,1,"    Why is it that this has not been a bigger _x000D_
priority of the Federal Government? I mean, this is a lot of _x000D_
money that we are leaving on the table that is fraudulently _x000D_
going out the door that could be used for real things that we _x000D_
need to do? As I look at the big picture here, why have we not _x000D_
made it a bigger priority?_x000D_
    I guess I would direct it to the Inspector General, Mr. _x000D_
O'Carroll, and from your work that you have done, I would like _x000D_
to hear your impressive GAO, Ms. Davis. Why is this not a _x000D_
bigger priority? You have been working on these issues for _x000D_
years and you have been coming to Congress and this is a huge _x000D_
issue."
2925410,2925409,2925411,19240,1,"    Agreed, Senator. We are in a unique position _x000D_
as the SSA OIG because we represent the Council of the _x000D_
Inspectors General as liaison with OMB on this thing. I have to _x000D_
say, there has been a lot more emphasis on identifying improper _x000D_
payments, curbing improper payments, and probably the biggest _x000D_
improvement is the Do Not Pay list, which is making all the _x000D_
government agencies compare this information so that, as an _x000D_
example, OPM will not be sending out a pension check to _x000D_
somebody that another agency thinks is deceased._x000D_
    And I guess the only other issue that I asked for some help _x000D_
on, and I mentioned this before in another hearing, is that _x000D_
data matching between agencies is handicapped in so many _x000D_
different ways, where one agency is not allowed to provide its _x000D_
data because of the Computer Matching Act._x000D_
    And that is probably the biggest issue now, where one _x000D_
person is receiving a benefit from one agency and then should _x000D_
not be receiving a benefit from another agency. We cannot do _x000D_
that kind of audit work._x000D_
    I cannot match our data with, let us say, for example, _x000D_
Department of Labor to find the people that are on worker's _x000D_
compensation and are also getting disability benefits from SSA. _x000D_
Or when they are disqualified for worker's compensation letting _x000D_
SSA know that they have improved. So that type of data _x000D_
matching, I think, would be extremely useful in trying to _x000D_
prevent improper payments."
2925411,2925410,2925412,19240,1,"    My time is up, but just so I understand, is _x000D_
that just a law change or it is a system like a computer system _x000D_
change, meaning from the hardware, the fact that we have _x000D_
agencies not communicating with each other?"
2925412,2925411,2925413,19240,1,"    It is a law change and there is a bill out _x000D_
there now that has included it."
2925413,2925412,2925414,19240,1,    All right.
2925414,2925413,2925415,19240,1,"    Senator Ernst, if you are ready."
2925415,2925414,2925416,19240,1,"    Yes, thank you."
2925416,2925415,2925417,19240,1,    Just in the nick of time.
2925417,2925416,2925418,19240,1,"    Thank you, Senator Johnson. I appreciate it _x000D_
and thank you, everyone, for your testimony today. I do _x000D_
appreciate it. Bottom line, up front, this is a situation we _x000D_
have to fix. I do not think anybody disagrees with that._x000D_
    So what I would like to ask, Inspector General O'Carroll, _x000D_
if you would please--what I will do, I will read this quote _x000D_
that came from the management at SSA, and this was in response _x000D_
to the IG's findings and recommendations. The recommendations _x000D_
would create a significant manual and labor intensive workload _x000D_
and provide no benefit to the administration of our programs._x000D_
    I think we have talked about this. I heard some mention of _x000D_
this. But do you feel an accurate and reliable death master _x000D_
file is the responsibility of the SSA?"
2925418,2925417,2925419,19240,1,"    The easy answer on that is yes, that I think _x000D_
that any data that SSA is providing to the government, to the _x000D_
public has to be accurate. That was pretty much the reason why _x000D_
we identified the 6.5 million. When you are doing audits and _x000D_
things like that, you are looking for large outliers and that _x000D_
is what this group was, a large outlier._x000D_
    So yes on that. I understand if you ask Sean, what he is _x000D_
going to say is that none of them are getting benefits from SSA _x000D_
and that SSA's primary responsibility is the benefit._x000D_
    But my point is that, and I think a good reason for this _x000D_
hearing, is that if there is the attention put on it by _x000D_
Congress, that SSA needs resources or whatever it needs to fix _x000D_
it, that is very important because as I said before, so many _x000D_
other different benefits in the States, in the government, plus _x000D_
voter registration and driver's licenses, everything else, all _x000D_
depend on the Death Master File and this is the only thing that _x000D_
is out there to prevent fraud."
2925419,2925418,2925420,19240,1,"    Yes, thank you. I would agree and I think _x000D_
this is a good start and yes, it is an easy answer to say yes. _x000D_
But we do know now we need to move forward and correct the _x000D_
deficiencies that are out there. There are so many improper _x000D_
payments that are going out, not to mention some of the issues _x000D_
that have been brought up with those not receiving payments, _x000D_
but we also have fraudulent voter registrations, we have _x000D_
illegal use of numbers for employment or for government _x000D_
assistance, so many other issues that come with this._x000D_
    I do believe that you have delivered around 70 _x000D_
recommendations to the Social Security Administration over the _x000D_
past number of years. Can you please tell us, how many of those _x000D_
have been implemented over the years?"
2925420,2925419,2925421,19240,1,"    Yes. Of the 70 that we have recommended--_x000D_
well, first, there are two steps to that. The first step is an _x000D_
agreement, and we are getting about 93-percent agreement from _x000D_
SSA. But out of that 70, probably about 50 have been enacted._x000D_
    In fairness, some of them, as Sean just mentioned, were in _x000D_
the last 6 months. We have issued maybe four or five audits _x000D_
with a lot of different recommendations that they have not _x000D_
really had time enough to implement. But as an example we watch _x000D_
that very closely. We go back every few years and take a look _x000D_
to see if they agreed with something, whether or not it was _x000D_
implemented, and if it was not, we bring it to their attention."
2925421,2925420,2925422,19240,1,"    And then with these recommendations and any _x000D_
others that are coming out, can any of you please to the panel, _x000D_
really give an overall cost estimate, man hours, additional _x000D_
time, any of those parameters that might be necessary to make _x000D_
sure that corrections were implemented?"
2925422,2925421,2925423,19240,1,"    And that is a good thing. However, you _x000D_
cannot dispute that there are still 6.5 million numbers that _x000D_
exist out there, and even though they may not be drawing _x000D_
benefits on those numbers, it is still an issue whether it is _x000D_
voter registration or some other fraudulent use of a number. So _x000D_
that is a concern."
2925423,2925422,2925424,19240,1,"    Very good. Mr. Brune, if you were a lawmaker _x000D_
for a day, what would your recommendation be? Just bottom line, _x000D_
very easy. What would your recommendation be to this Congress?"
2925424,2925423,2925425,19240,1,"    OK. I do appreciate that. Thank you so much _x000D_
for your testimony today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
Would you say that again? [Laughter.]"
2925425,2925424,2925426,19240,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2925426,2925425,2925427,19240,1,"    I told the staff, please do not tell him I _x000D_
did this. I caught myself. I want to go back, if I could, the _x000D_
question I am going to ask, similar to what Senator Ernst just _x000D_
asked, and that I started asking earlier Mr. Bertoni. If there _x000D_
is one thing, only one thing we were to do, what would it be? _x000D_
You are the only one I got to pick on. Senator Ernst just said _x000D_
it, came back and sort of followed up on that, which is good, _x000D_
but I am going to ask it before we finish this one thing._x000D_
    I want to come back to the portion of your testimony, Mr. _x000D_
Mader, where you went through a series of items, series of _x000D_
ideas, I think, are contained in the President's 2016 budget. _x000D_
And a number of them involved program integrity. Some of them _x000D_
involved funding, providing resources for the IRS. Would you _x000D_
just step through those for us again? And I am going to ask our _x000D_
other panelists to respond briefly to those, which ones they _x000D_
think make sense."
2925427,2925426,2925428,19240,1,"    I think, Senator, we touched on EITC. There are _x000D_
a series of program integrity initiatives across HHS and, in _x000D_
fact, in the current budget in 2015, actually, we were _x000D_
fortunate to receive funding for one of those. There are _x000D_
program integrity initiatives across DOL and I think they have _x000D_
demonstrated, in a pilot program with the States--because _x000D_
recognizing that unemployment insurance is a block grant to the _x000D_
State--but they have demonstrated using New York State as the _x000D_
key to doing some very creative analytics, and again in 2016, _x000D_
we have asked for continued funding of those initiatives._x000D_
    So I think across in my testimony, there are about half a _x000D_
dozen that we mentioned, and that actually was probably the top _x000D_
six. We could provide a few more for the record. But those are, _x000D_
I think, going back to the Senator's comment, I think that if _x000D_
there was one thing I could ask for, maybe two, is get to _x000D_
Treasury the full death master file because that is the place _x000D_
that we are running all of the civilian payments past, and _x000D_
having the most accurate set of data would be a real benefit. _x000D_
So that is the one ask._x000D_
    The other ask is--and I strongly believe that in order to _x000D_
save money, we need to make an investment, and a 16 investment _x000D_
in those half a dozen or so program integrities, I believe, and _x000D_
I think the Administration strongly believes, that we will see _x000D_
benefits in driving not only the rate, but the total amount of _x000D_
improper payments down if we are allowed to make those kinds of _x000D_
enhancements."
2925428,2925427,2925429,19240,1,"    OK. Thank you. Mr. Brune, Mr. O'Carroll, _x000D_
any comments on what we just heard from David, especially with _x000D_
that first request?"
2925429,2925428,2925430,19240,1,"    In terms of the timing, I seem to recall 5 _x000D_
months. I might be confusing the testimony I have heard. There _x000D_
is a delay, we need 5 months until late October. Can someone _x000D_
help me with this? Am I imagining this?"
2925430,2925429,2925431,19240,1,"    The delay on the release you are talking _x000D_
about, Senator?"
2925431,2925430,2925432,19240,1,    I think so.
2925432,2925431,2925433,19240,1,"    Yes. One of the bills that came out of _x000D_
Committee is that it will be 3 years before death data goes _x000D_
public. And we applaud it because it was based on one of our _x000D_
audit findings, that if you give extra time to a person who has _x000D_
been reported dead, they can come into SSA and get it fixed _x000D_
before it goes out into the public. And I have to say, that is _x000D_
probably the best thing that has happened with death reporting."
2925433,2925432,2925434,19240,1,"    OK. Anybody else want to give us a killer _x000D_
idea, maybe something that has already been mentioned once or _x000D_
twice, maybe not?"
2925434,2925433,2925435,19240,1,    What percent?
2925435,2925434,2925436,19240,1,"    Ms. Davis, I have not picked on you very _x000D_
much. How about sharing something with us?"
2925436,2925435,2925437,19240,1,"    Well, if I could look at a bit higher level, at _x000D_
the overall improper payments estimate this past year, which _x000D_
was almost $125 billion, there were actually three drivers of _x000D_
the increase of $19 billion and those three drivers were _x000D_
Medicare, Fee-for-Service, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax _x000D_
Credit program._x000D_
    When you look at those increases individually, Medicare, _x000D_
Fee-for-Service was almost $10 billion, Medicaid a little over _x000D_
$3 billion, and then the Earned Income Tax Credit program was a _x000D_
little over $3 billion as well. You look at those and you have _x000D_
65 percent of your entire estimate of improper payments._x000D_
    What is of concern is that these programs, in particular _x000D_
the health care programs, are growing. For example, HHS has _x000D_
estimated or predicted that over the next 3 years, that the _x000D_
Medicare and the Medicaid programs are going to expand program _x000D_
outlays by about 8 percent annually over the next 3 years._x000D_
    So if you take that and you compare it or analyze it _x000D_
against the rate increases, there are some concerns, definite _x000D_
concerns. Again, to be a little bit more specific, the rate for _x000D_
the Fee-for-Service program was 10.1 percent last year. It is _x000D_
now 12.7 percent. The Medicaid also went up almost a whole _x000D_
percentage point._x000D_
    The Earned Income Tax Credit, over the past 5 years, has _x000D_
been running about 25 percent. Last year it was a little over _x000D_
24 and now it is over 27. So if you look at these programs and _x000D_
the facts that the rates, error rates in these programs are _x000D_
increasing, and the compound that with a possibility that _x000D_
program outlays are going to increase, it is going to be _x000D_
difficult to get a handle on these overall governmentwide _x000D_
improper payments."
2925437,2925436,2925438,19240,1,"    Great. Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
fort here. Not only is our Ranking Member highly interested in _x000D_
this issue, but he is also a pretty good sprinter. I saw him in _x000D_
the hallway. I have only got a couple questions left. I really _x000D_
want to kind of explore the EDRs and the differences between _x000D_
the States and the data that comes from those._x000D_
    I do not know who is the best person to talk to about that. _x000D_
Is that you, Mr. O'Carroll?"
2925438,2925437,2925439,19240,1,    I will let Sean do the first one.
2925439,2925438,2925440,19240,1,"    Do you have a stats in terms of the _x000D_
accuracy of the information coming from States with EDR versus _x000D_
those that do not have EDR?"
2925440,2925439,2925441,19240,1,"    Again, those are in the exact form that _x000D_
you want it in, correct?"
2925441,2925440,2925442,19240,1,    It totally matches your database?
2925442,2925441,2925443,19240,1,"    So again, from the States that do not _x000D_
have EDR, are you also getting those from their offices of _x000D_
vital statistics or is that where you are getting things from _x000D_
financial institutions, Postal, I mean, all the others?"
2925443,2925442,2925444,19240,1,"    So you do not have the localities within _x000D_
a State submitting the information to some kind of central data _x000D_
center and then have those electronic records forwarded to _x000D_
Social Security? You are getting these from multiple sources _x000D_
within a State?"
2925444,2925443,2925445,19240,1,"    But again, so the 37 States you get that _x000D_
from, they come from a centralized vital statistics office _x000D_
within the State? They may be getting the information from _x000D_
multiple sources, but they accumulate it and there is just one _x000D_
contact for Social Security within those 37 States?"
2925445,2925444,2925446,19240,1,"    So what has been the hang-up in the 13 _x000D_
other States? I mean, just resistance? Is it funding? I mean, _x000D_
the other 37 States, do they fund their electronic death _x000D_
records or registries themselves?"
2925446,2925445,2925447,19240,1,"    OK. I am all for States' rights, but this _x000D_
might be something that we maybe need to work on. Ms. Davis, I _x000D_
did want to talk about exactly how we calculate total number of _x000D_
improper payments and also verify. My staff is telling me it is _x000D_
about 90 percent of those improper payments really are over-_x000D_
payments, correct? Or is it about that? What is your _x000D_
information in terms of over-payments versus under-payments, _x000D_
because we talk about improper. What is the mix?"
2925447,2925446,2925448,19240,1,"    We have not done recent work to determine the _x000D_
actual mix. I will say, though, that the majority are over-_x000D_
payments, and there are a number of items, of course, that are _x000D_
classified as improper payments because there is insufficient _x000D_
documentation."
2925448,2925447,2925449,19240,1,"    The calculation of the 1-point or $124.7 _x000D_
billion, that is all through statistical sampling, correct?"
2925449,2925448,2925450,19240,1,"    Correct, statistical. I mean, let me qualify _x000D_
that statement. It is statistically valid sampling _x000D_
methodologies, but OMB, the OMB Director can approve an _x000D_
alternate methodology."
2925450,2925449,2925451,19240,1,"    OK. Well, those are my final questions. I _x000D_
guess I would like to just go over the panel if there is a _x000D_
particular point you want to make, one point relatively brief, _x000D_
to close out the hearing. I will start with you, Mr. Bertoni."
2925451,2925450,2925452,19240,1,    Thank you. Mr. Brune.
2925452,2925451,2925453,19240,1,    OK. Appreciate that. Mr. O'Carroll.
2925453,2925452,2925454,19240,1,"    Chairman, once again, my biggest one is that _x000D_
we asked for an exemption to the Computer Matching and Privacy _x000D_
Protection Act for IGs. But by the same token, it should go to _x000D_
the IGs and the parent agency. So as an example, when we do an _x000D_
audit and we can find that there is an issue of one agency _x000D_
making payments when another agency is not making payments, we _x000D_
can then have the parent agencies make those matches."
2925454,2925453,2925455,19240,1,    OK. Thank you. Mr. Mader.
2925455,2925454,2925456,19240,1,"    I think supporting the various program integrity _x000D_
initiatives in the President's budget."
2925456,2925455,2925457,19240,1,"    Thank you. Ms. Davis. By the way, I _x000D_
really appreciate these brief statements. Ms. Davis."
2925457,2925456,2925458,19240,1,"    The improper payments legislation requires _x000D_
Inspector Generals to perform annual reviews of compliance with _x000D_
the criterion on IPERA and there are a number of issues that _x000D_
they have identified over the last several years. Implementing _x000D_
the recommendations that are made by these Inspectors General _x000D_
would go far in helping to reduce improper payments."
2925458,2925457,2925459,19240,1,"    OK. Well, again, I just want to thank all _x000D_
the witnesses for your thoughtful testimony, your thoughtful _x000D_
answers to our questions. Ms. Rivers, thank you for sharing _x000D_
your story, and again, this Committee is dedicated to making _x000D_
sure this is not just a hearing, but something comes out of _x000D_
this. So we want to work very closely with all the agencies so _x000D_
we can, again, prevent the type of situation that Ms. Rivers _x000D_
has had to deal with._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 15 days, until _x000D_
March 31t, at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and _x000D_
questions for the record. This hearing is adjourned."
2925459,2925458,2925460,19241,1,"    Good morning. This hearing will come to _x000D_
order. Senator Carper is on his way, and his staff informed me _x000D_
that we could get underway here._x000D_
    I would like to, without objection, enter my opening _x000D_
comments into the record.\1\ Hearing no objection, so ordered._x000D_

Appendix on page 981._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As I was talking to the witnesses before the hearing here, _x000D_
this is our fifth in a series of four hearings on border _x000D_
security, and what we are trying to do is we are trying to lay _x000D_
out the reality. And I think Senator Booker would agree with me _x000D_
it is not a pleasant reality. It is an enormously difficult _x000D_
problem. And, of course, in terms of illegal immigration, in _x000D_
terms of drug trafficking, the biggest problem is, no doubt _x000D_
about it, on the Southern Border._x000D_
    As my Ranking Member says repeatedly--and I completely _x000D_
agree with this, coming from a manufacturing background--we _x000D_
really need to analyze the root cause of the problem._x000D_
    We had an extremely good meeting with General Kelly, head _x000D_
of Southern Command, yesterday just discussing the problems in _x000D_
Central America and the problems with border security and the _x000D_
drug trafficking. And looking for that root cause we were _x000D_
discussing that it is really America's demand for drugs, how _x000D_
that demand has created these drug cartels that really has _x000D_
corroded and been so harmful to the societies in Central _x000D_
America. We bear some responsibility for that._x000D_
    So these are not going to be easy problems to solve, but we _x000D_
have to make incremental improvements. I come from a _x000D_
manufacturing background. Nothing is ever perfect. You always _x000D_
have to continuously improve._x000D_
    So, again, the purpose of this hearing and every hearing is _x000D_
to get the people watching, the people on the dais here, _x000D_
admitting we have the problem by trying to lay out that reality _x000D_
properly._x000D_
    I see that my Ranking Member, our Ranking Member has joined _x000D_
us here, so I would like to turn it over to you if you have _x000D_
some opening comments."
2925460,2925459,2925461,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    This Committee really is pretty well populated with _x000D_
Senators from those Northern Border States. We have got Senator _x000D_
Peters from Michigan. I am from Wisconsin. We have Senator _x000D_
Tester from Montana, Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota, _x000D_
Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire. So this really is a pretty _x000D_
relevant hearing, and----"
2925461,2925460,2925462,19241,1,"    No. You are welcome as well. It is all _x000D_
part and parcel of the same problem. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    We are actually glad to see you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    But, again, I do want to welcome the witnesses. Thank you _x000D_
for your very thoughtful testimony, and we are really looking _x000D_
forward to your testimony._x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you would all rise and raise your right hand. _x000D_
Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?"
2925462,2925461,2925463,19241,1,    I do.
2925463,2925462,2925464,19241,1,    I do.
2925464,2925463,2925465,19241,1,    I do.
2925465,2925464,2925466,19241,1,    I do.
2925466,2925465,2925467,19241,1,    I do.
2925467,2925466,2925468,19241,1,"    Thank you._x000D_
    By the way, we do have votes starting at 10:45, so I would _x000D_
ask the witnesses to keep your opening statements to the 6-_x000D_
minute timeframe so we have time for questions, because we have _x000D_
got good attendance here by our Committee._x000D_
    Our first witness is Michael J. Fisher. He is the Chief of _x000D_
the U.S. Border Patrol. Chief Fisher joined the U.S. Border _x000D_
Patrol in June 1987 and has served in numerous sectors and _x000D_
positions since then, including Field Operations Supervisor in _x000D_
El Paso, Deputy Chief Patrol Agent of the Detroit Sector, _x000D_
Assistant Chief Patrol Agent in the Tucson Sector, and Chief _x000D_
Patrol Agent of the San Diego Sector. Mr. Fisher._x000D_
_x000D_
TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL FISHER,\1\ CHIEF, U."
2925468,2925467,2925469,19241,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Carper, _x000D_
and Members of the Committee. It is indeed a privilege to _x000D_
appear today on behalf of the United States Border Patrol to _x000D_
discuss our strategy to secure the Northern Border between the _x000D_
ports of entry._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wagner _x000D_
appears in the Appendix on page 984._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Our approach along the Northern Border supports U.S. _x000D_
Customs and Border Protection's overarching strategic themes of _x000D_
collaboration, integration, and innovation. Collaboration at _x000D_
all levels, including information sharing and operational _x000D_
coordination, among U.S. and Canadian law enforcement is _x000D_
critical to the shared security of the border._x000D_
    Advanced information and intelligence is and will always be _x000D_
the key to minimizing risk along our borders. For instance, the _x000D_
Operational Integration Center (OIC), located at Selfridge Air _x000D_
National Guard Base in Michigan, is a information-sharing _x000D_
demonstration project to enhance the situational awareness of _x000D_
CBP and our mission partners, including U.S. Coast Guard _x000D_
(USCG), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), State and _x000D_
local law enforcement, as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted _x000D_
Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Border Services Agency._x000D_
    The OIC consolidates a wide range of information, including _x000D_
radar and camera feeds, blue force tracking, database queries _x000D_
from databases not previously available to CBP, remote sensor _x000D_
inputs, remote video surveillance and mobile surveillance _x000D_
system (MSS) feeds, and video from various ports of entry. _x000D_
Additional information feeds such as local traffic cameras will _x000D_
be added in the near future._x000D_
    In terms of innovation, our joint efforts to improve _x000D_
existing surveillance technologies that can overcome Northern _x000D_
Border terrain and environmental challenges, the Department of _x000D_
Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate is _x000D_
collaborating with Canada along with us in a Sensor Sharing _x000D_
Pilot to demonstrate the capability and operational utility of _x000D_
a common surveillance picture between CBP and the RCMP, using a _x000D_
combination of U.S. and Canadian sensor information. Our _x000D_
situational awareness on the Northern Border is enhanced by _x000D_
technological capabilities, including thermal camera systems, _x000D_
mobile surveillance systems, and remote video surveillance _x000D_
systems._x000D_
    CBP's Office of Air and Marine (OAM) has 41 fixed-wing and _x000D_
rotary aircraft equipped with sensors stationed along the _x000D_
Northern Border, including two unmanned aerial systems (UASs), _x000D_
and they operate out of the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North _x000D_
Dakota. UAS flights improve our situational awareness and _x000D_
border security in areas that are difficult to reach._x000D_
    In addition, we are expanding the coherent change detection _x000D_
technology along the Northern Border this year. As this _x000D_
Committee is aware, this is the same methodology that allows us _x000D_
to cover approximately 900 miles along the Southwest Border _x000D_
without having to deploy technology or Border Patrol agents._x000D_
    Finally, our integration efforts continue as well. For _x000D_
instance, each month CBP produces the State of the Northern _x000D_
Border Briefing, which provides a cross-component, multi-agency _x000D_
intelligence report for identifying, monitoring, and addressing _x000D_
emerging trends and threats along the Northern Border. The _x000D_
report is produced in direct collaboration with our Canadian _x000D_
partners as well as other Federal, State, and local partners. _x000D_
The State of the Northern Border has provided a broader avenue _x000D_
for information sharing and great intelligence insight to _x000D_
activity with a nexus along our Northern Border._x000D_
    The Border Patrol is also an active participant in several _x000D_
targeted joint operations which are called the ``Integrated _x000D_
Border Enforcement Teams,'' (IBET). They are comprised of U.S. _x000D_
and Canadian law enforcement personnel, encompassing 15 regions _x000D_
along the Northern Border. IBETs operate as intelligence-driven _x000D_
information teams designed to increase information-and _x000D_
intelligence-sharing capabilities among the appropriate U.S. _x000D_
and Canadian authorities. By incorporating integrated mobile _x000D_
response capabilities in the air, land, and the marine _x000D_
environments, the IBETs provide participating law enforcement _x000D_
agencies with a force multiplier that maximizes border _x000D_
enforcement efforts._x000D_
    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, again, thank you _x000D_
for the opportunity to appear today, and I look forward to your _x000D_
questions."
2925469,2925468,2925470,19241,1,"    Thank you, Chief Fisher._x000D_
    I do want to note that the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of _x000D_
the Office of Field Operations (OFO), John Wagner, that was _x000D_
also your written statement, but let me just introduce you as _x000D_
well. You have been assigned to the CBP headquarters since _x000D_
1999. Mr. Wagner began his Federal law enforcement career in _x000D_
1991 when he joined U.S. Customs Service as a Customs _x000D_
Inspector. Mr. Wagner also has worked at the New York-New _x000D_
Jersey Seaport and the Port of Laredo, Texas. So, again, we _x000D_
appreciate you joining us here and look forward to your answers _x000D_
to questions._x000D_
    Our next witness will be James Spero. He is a Special Agent _x000D_
in Charge for the Buffalo, New York, area. Mr. Spero also _x000D_
served as the Deputy Assistant Director of the ICE _x000D_
Transnational Crime and Public Safety Division, Unit Chief for _x000D_
the Identify and Benefit Fraud Unit at ICE headquarters, and _x000D_
Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations (HSI) Washington field office. Mr. Spero._x000D_

   TESTIMONY OF JAMES C. SPERO,\1\ SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, _x000D_
HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS BUFFALO, U."
2925470,2925469,2925471,19241,1,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and _x000D_
distinguished Members, thank you for the opportunity to appear _x000D_
before you to discuss ICE's efforts to improve security along _x000D_
the Northern Border._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Spero appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 992._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As DHS' principal investigative agency, Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations is positioned to leverage its broad statutory _x000D_
authority to support border enforcement. HSI works in close _x000D_
coordination with DHS components and U.S. interagency partners, _x000D_
as well as our counterparts in Canadian law enforcement, to _x000D_
target transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) involved in _x000D_
illicit travel, trade, and finance. HSI applies a full range of _x000D_
innovative investigative and enforcement techniques, including _x000D_
leading and participating in joint U.S.-Canadian task forces, _x000D_
undercover operations, controlled deliveries, asset _x000D_
identification and removal, confidential informants, and Title _x000D_
III electronic intercepts to identify and disrupt criminal _x000D_
operations. We have nearly 1,300 special agents and 100 _x000D_
intelligence research specialists operating along the Northern _x000D_
Border._x000D_
    In fiscal year (FY) 2014, HSI's seven Special Agent in _x000D_
Charge offices covering the Northern Border, often in joint or _x000D_
cooperative investigations with Federal, State, local, tribal, _x000D_
and Canadian law enforcement, seized more than $237 million in _x000D_
cash and monetary instruments, nearly 26,000 pounds of _x000D_
marijuana, 2,000 pounds of cocaine, 146 pounds of ecstasy, 719 _x000D_
pounds of heroin, 949 pounds of methamphetamine, nearly 1,400 _x000D_
weapons and firearms, over 55,000 rounds of ammunition, and _x000D_
about 8,400 weapon components. HSI Special Agents made over _x000D_
5,700 criminal arrests resulting in nearly 3,800 indictments _x000D_
and approximately 3,500 convictions. These statistics reflect _x000D_
the impact of our coordinated law enforcement investments and _x000D_
investigations along the Northern Border._x000D_
    Additionally, HSI maintains the largest investigative _x000D_
footprint of any U.S. law enforcement agency in Canada. HSI's _x000D_
four attache offices, located in Ottawa, Vancouver, Toronto, _x000D_
and Montreal, further enhance national security by serving as _x000D_
ICE's liaison to our interagency partners and our counterparts _x000D_
in local government and law enforcement._x000D_
    Our partnerships are essential to joint operations and _x000D_
information sharing along the Northern Border and beyond. One _x000D_
example is how HSI participates in the Federal Bureau of _x000D_
Investigations (FBI)-led Joint Terrorism Task Force. HSI brings _x000D_
its unique authorities and experience to the task force to help _x000D_
protect the homeland from threats to national security._x000D_
    HSI's flagship task force program, the Border Enforcement _x000D_
Security Task Force (BEST), was created in 2005 as a mechanism _x000D_
to address the threat of cross-border crime. In 2007, ICE began _x000D_
to deploy BEST units along the Northern Border. BEST provides a _x000D_
proven and flexible platform from which DHS investigates and _x000D_
targets transnational criminal organizations that attempt to _x000D_
exploit perceived vulnerabilities at our Nation's borders._x000D_
    BEST units differ from other task forces due to their _x000D_
proximity to the border and the program's focus on cross-border _x000D_
criminal activity. Currently, there are four BEST units _x000D_
operating along the Northern Border. One significant advantage _x000D_
of the BEST task force model is the participation and _x000D_
integration of foreign law enforcement personnel who have the _x000D_
ability to conduct cross-border investigations with HSI and our _x000D_
Federal, State, local, and tribal partners to address criminal _x000D_
activity on both sides of the border._x000D_
    One successful collaboration with our international law _x000D_
enforcement partners is Operation Primed, which is an HSI _x000D_
Buffalo investigation that targeted a cocaine-smuggling _x000D_
organization involved in the illicit movement of cocaine and _x000D_
bulk cash within Canada, the United States, and Mexico. _x000D_
Investigators estimated that this organization was responsible _x000D_
for the smuggling of approximately 1,600 kilograms of cocaine _x000D_
into Canada with a street value of over $60 million. Through _x000D_
successful collaboration with Canadian law enforcement, a high-_x000D_
level target was sentenced in May 2014 to 84 months of _x000D_
incarceration. This individual was arrested in September 2010 _x000D_
when attempting to export 97 kilograms of cocaine across the _x000D_
Lewiston Bridge Port of Entry from New York into Canada. The 97 _x000D_
kilograms of cocaine seizure is to this day the largest seizure _x000D_
in the history of the Port of Buffalo._x000D_
    In conclusion, ICE remains dedicated and committed to this _x000D_
mission, and we look forward to continuing to work with this _x000D_
Committee on these efforts._x000D_
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I _x000D_
would be pleased to answer any questions."
2925471,2925470,2925472,19241,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Spero._x000D_
    I have been informed that Mr. Wagner does have an opening _x000D_
statement. Would you like to give that now, or would you like _x000D_
to wait until the very end?"
2925472,2925471,2925473,19241,1,    I thought I was off the hook.
2925473,2925472,2925474,19241,1,"    Oh, no. Would you like to give it now or _x000D_
would you like to----"
2925474,2925473,2925475,19241,1,    I will give it now if that is OK.
2925475,2925474,2925476,19241,1,"    OK, sure. Mr. Wagner._x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF JOHN WAGNER,\1\ DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER, _x000D_
OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS, U."
2925476,2925475,2925477,19241,1,"    Thank you. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the _x000D_
opportunity to appear today on behalf of CBP's Office of Field _x000D_
Operations to discuss our security and facilitation efforts at _x000D_
ports of entry along our Northern Border._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Wagner _x000D_
appears in the Appendix on page 984._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The U.S. international boundary with Canada delineates two _x000D_
friendly nations with a long history of social, cultural, and _x000D_
economic ties that have contributed to a high volume of cross-_x000D_
border trade and travel, amounting to $2 billion a day. CBP _x000D_
ensures that our Northern Border operations protect and secure _x000D_
the vital flow of commerce through trade and travel between our _x000D_
two countries._x000D_
    The United States and Canada are connected by more than 120 _x000D_
land ports of entry, 750 daily flights by commercial aircraft, _x000D_
and numerous commercial and recreational vessels that cross the _x000D_
maritime border, ensuring the security and efficient flow of _x000D_
cross-border activity. CBP has more than 3,600 CBP officers and _x000D_
190 agriculture specialists stationed on the border, ensuring _x000D_
dangerous goods, contraband, and individuals are intercepted _x000D_
and legitimate travelers and cargo are expedited._x000D_
    At many Northern Border ports of entry, we continue to _x000D_
invest in and deploy radio frequency identification technology. _x000D_
This technology, along with the 2009 implementation of the _x000D_
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which requires a _x000D_
passport or other secure document to enter the United States, _x000D_
allows CBP to query nearly 100 percent of travelers against law _x000D_
enforcement and terrorist screening databases. We also continue _x000D_
to deploy next-generation license plate readers, large-scale _x000D_
and small-scale imaging technology, as well as a variety of _x000D_
portable and handheld technology, including radiation portal _x000D_
monitors._x000D_
    Additionally, DHS and Canadian agencies are collaborating _x000D_
to develop, advance, operationally test, and use technologies _x000D_
to enhance cross-border operations. As part of this effort, we _x000D_
have also made significant investments in infrastructure. Since _x000D_
February 2009, the U.S. Government has invested over $400 _x000D_
million to rebuild and improve more than 30 ports of entry _x000D_
along the Northern Border._x000D_
    Our northern ports of entry experience a very high volume _x000D_
of international trade and travel. Each year, approximately 72 _x000D_
million travelers enter the United States through the border _x000D_
with Canada for business, tourism, school, and to visit family _x000D_
and friends. Many of our initiatives to facilitate lawful _x000D_
international travel at the Northern Border simultaneously _x000D_
increase security. Likewise, CBP develops effective and _x000D_
efficient security operations designed to be contributors to _x000D_
travel facilitation, not barriers._x000D_
    Security measures vitally protect travel and tourism from _x000D_
the damaging effects of terrorists and other security _x000D_
incidents. Identifying and separating low-risk travelers from _x000D_
those who may require additional scrutiny is a key element in _x000D_
our efforts to facilitate and secure international travel._x000D_
    The volume of trade crossing the Northern Border is equally _x000D_
significant. In 2014, the combined two-way trade and investment _x000D_
between the United States and Canada totaled $759 billion. The _x000D_
United States and Canada are each other's largest export _x000D_
market, with roughly 16 percent of all U.S. exports destined to _x000D_
Canada._x000D_
    CBP is committed to a coordinated approach working with our _x000D_
Federal, private sector, and Canadian partners to facilitate _x000D_
the secure flow of trade and travel, reduce transaction costs, _x000D_
and promote economic growth along the Northern Border._x000D_
    In 2011, the United States and Canada signed the Beyond the _x000D_
Border Initiative. CBP is the primary lead on 15 of the Beyond _x000D_
the Border Initiatives and has significant interest and _x000D_
participates in seven others. I would like to highlight just a _x000D_
few of our accomplishments to date._x000D_
    We have completed the first two phases of the entry-exit _x000D_
pilot, which involves an exchange of entry records of travelers _x000D_
at ports of entry along the U.S.-Canadian border in such a _x000D_
manner that land entries into one country will serve as the _x000D_
exit record from another._x000D_
    We have launched a cargo pre-inspection pilot to test the _x000D_
feasibility of conducting primary cargo processing in Canada to _x000D_
reduce wait times and congestion. Phase I of the pilot was _x000D_
completed in Blaine, Washington, and Surrey, British Columbia; _x000D_
Phase II at the Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, _x000D_
Ontario, also recently concluded._x000D_
    On March 16, DHS concluded negotiations of a new _x000D_
preclearance agreement for land, rail, marine, and air modes of _x000D_
travel. We have also expanded the NEXUS trusted traveler _x000D_
program to over 1.1 million travelers, an increase of _x000D_
approximately 80 percent since 2011._x000D_
    Canada and the United States are striving to provide a _x000D_
secure and trusted global supply chain that allows for safe, _x000D_
timely, economically prosperous movement of cargo into and _x000D_
between the two countries. A key means of achieving this _x000D_
objective is through the Integrated Cargo Security Strategy, _x000D_
which seeks to address risks at the earliest opportunity. We _x000D_
conducted pilots in Prince Rupert and Montreal, testing the _x000D_
ability to use advance data and adopt common standards for _x000D_
security screening and inspecting inbound marine cargo at the _x000D_
first point of arrival in North America._x000D_
    Canada and the United States continue to align and _x000D_
harmonize their Tier 1 trusted trader programs--in Canada, the _x000D_
Partners in Protection (PIP) Program, and in the United States, _x000D_
the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) _x000D_
program. We are expecting to launch a fully automated _x000D_
harmonization process allowing a joint application for the _x000D_
cross-border highway carriers in the PIP and C-TPAT programs by _x000D_
fall of this year, and this will allow companies interested in _x000D_
joining both programs to submit a single application and to _x000D_
manage only one partnership account instead of two._x000D_
    We have also engaged with local entities and authorities to _x000D_
increase security through public-private partnerships. For _x000D_
example, CBP and the DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office have _x000D_
partnered with Buffalo and the Fort Erie Public Bridge _x000D_
Authority to replace 18 radiation portal monitors at the CBP _x000D_
primary inspection lanes in northern New York. This agreement _x000D_
was reached in November 2014 and was just recently completed. _x000D_
The enhancements will increase security and efficiency by _x000D_
supporting new calibration procedures that will reduce _x000D_
radiation nuisance alarm rates by over 50 percent._x000D_
    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, Members of the _x000D_
Committee, thank you again for the opportunity to testify _x000D_
today, and I am happy to answer any of your questions."

    Our next witness is David Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez began _x000D_
his career with the U.S. Customs Service in 1970. From 1973 to _x000D_
1997, Mr. Rodriguez worked at the Drug Enforcement _x000D_
Administration (DEA). In 1997, he was selected as the Director _x000D_
for the Northwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (NW _x000D_
HIDTA) program in Seattle, Washington. In 2010, the NW HIDTA--_x000D_
you get used to acronyms in this business--received national _x000D_
awards for its interdiction program on the U.S.-Canada border. _x000D_

2925478,2925477,2925479,19241,1,"    Chairman Johnson, distinguished Members of _x000D_
the Committee, my name is Dave Rodriguez from Seattle, _x000D_
Washington. We coordinate and do joint operations with more _x000D_
than 115 international, Federal, local, and State agencies _x000D_
throughout the Northwest. We help these agencies to identify _x000D_
drug threats as well as to implement strategies to address _x000D_
them._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Rodriguez appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1002._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The transnational criminal organizations operating on both _x000D_
sides of the U.S.-Canada border continue to move proceeds from _x000D_
illegal drugs sold in the United States and Canada, as well as _x000D_
drugs, weapons, and bulk cash. These organizations include _x000D_
Caucasian groups, ethnic East Indians, Asian Organized Crime _x000D_
groups, and members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. Also _x000D_
of prominence are the Mexican National drug-trafficking _x000D_
organizations, particularly those headed by Consolidated _x000D_
Priority Organization Targets, which have gained a strong _x000D_
foothold in the Pacific Northwest. These include but are not _x000D_
limited to the Sinaloa cartel, the Knights Templar, and the _x000D_
Beltran-Leyva organizations._x000D_
    Washington's topography and location render it susceptible _x000D_
to drug smuggling and production. The Washington section of the _x000D_
U.S. border is approximately 430 miles long, with 13 official _x000D_
ports of entry. A significant portion of the international _x000D_
border is located in secluded, dense forest. Remote expanses of _x000D_
public lands are susceptible to many types of drug-related _x000D_
criminal activities, and particularly to large-scale cannabis _x000D_
cultivation._x000D_
    Public lands that are adjacent to the U.S.-Canada border _x000D_
also serve as routes for drug and currency smuggling. Most of _x000D_
the area on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border is sparsely _x000D_
populated and encompassed by densely forested public lands _x000D_
where crossing the border can be accomplished without _x000D_
detection._x000D_
    Other threats to the U.S. Northern Border include illegal _x000D_
alien entry, human trafficking, money laundering, firearms _x000D_
trafficking, maritime and air smuggling, and threats relating _x000D_
to terrorist activities._x000D_
    The I-5 corridor is the main transportation route into the _x000D_
Pacific Northwest and into British Columbia, Canada. Multi-_x000D_
agency investigations show that Drug-Trafficking Organization _x000D_
(DTOs) continue to exploit remote areas along the Washington _x000D_
border, often throwing duffel bags or hockey bags containing _x000D_
drugs directly across the border. In some areas, we just have a _x000D_
ditch that separates the United States and the Canadian part of _x000D_
the territories._x000D_
    DTOs and transnational criminal organizations in the _x000D_
eastern region of the State take advantage of the remote areas _x000D_
of the border, the lack of cross-border detection equipment _x000D_
such as radar, and the lack of critical infrastructure cell _x000D_
towers to increase the use of these rural routes._x000D_
    Narcotics are often concealed in legitimate cargo onboard _x000D_
commercial trucks, cars, concealed truck compartments, and _x000D_
commercial and private trailers. Helicopters, airplanes, and _x000D_
boats are used to smuggle drug loads into and out of Canada. _x000D_
While cocaine and marijuana seizures along the Northern Border _x000D_
and Idaho declined in 2014 compared to previous years, there _x000D_
was a demonstrated increase in the quantity and frequency of _x000D_
methamphetamine loads being smuggled into British Columbia._x000D_
    MDMA seizures totaled over 48 kilograms in 2014. MDMA, or _x000D_
Ecstasy, smuggled from British Columbia to Washington State _x000D_
will continue as Canada is a primary source of MDMA in North _x000D_
America. The precursors are smuggled from China into Canada _x000D_
where it is processed. MDMA in tablet form remains a standard; _x000D_
however, recent investigations in the Northwest indicate that _x000D_
MDMA is also being smuggled in powdered form._x000D_
    Cocaine continues to be smuggled north into Canada, but _x000D_
seizures have been on the decline; 101 kilograms were seized on _x000D_
the Northern Border in the State of Washington, compared to _x000D_
over 800 kilograms that were seized in 2008 and 2009. Shipments _x000D_
are also known to be sent directly to Canada from areas outside _x000D_
the United States via air and maritime conveyances._x000D_
    Bulk cash seizures in 2013 totaled $3.1 million, and the _x000D_
year before that it was less than half a million. In 2014 it _x000D_
was approximately a million, demonstrating the fluctuation seen _x000D_
in bulk cash seizures year to year._x000D_
    Our efforts are guided by the 2012 Northern Border _x000D_
Counternarcotics Strategy updated in 2014, which articulates _x000D_
the U.S. framework for the ongoing effort to reduce the threats _x000D_
on both sides of the border. The strategy addresses joint _x000D_
efforts in the areas of intelligence collection, information _x000D_
sharing, interdiction at and between ports of entry, as well as _x000D_
in the air and maritime domains; investigations and _x000D_
prosecutions; disrupting and dismantling drug-trafficking _x000D_
organizations._x000D_
    Northwest HIDTA participates fully in the Northern Border _x000D_
programs and will continue to foster cooperation among Federal, _x000D_
State, local, tribal, and international law enforcement _x000D_
agencies along the Washington-British Columbia border. We also _x000D_
believe we share in and participate in an important role in _x000D_
intelligence sharing and enforcement initiatives, training, _x000D_
interdiction, and analytical support._x000D_
    To conclude, I would like to thank you for the opportunity _x000D_
to be able to testify here today."
2925479,2925478,2925480,19241,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez._x000D_
    Our next witness is Richard Hartunian. Mr. Hartunian is the _x000D_
U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, which _x000D_
covers 300 miles of the U.S.-Canada border. Mr. Hartunian sits _x000D_
on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee where he serves as _x000D_
the Co-Chair of the Border and Immigration Subcommittee in _x000D_
which he leads the Northern Border Working Group. Prior to _x000D_
this, he served as the Assistant U.S. Attorney and as the _x000D_
Northern District's Narcotics Chief and Organized Crime Drug _x000D_
Enforcement Task Force Coordinator. Mr. Hartunian._x000D_
_x000D_
  TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE RICHARD S. HARTUNIAN,\1\ UNITED _x000D_
STATES ATTORNEY, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, U."
2925480,2925479,2925481,19241,1,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and _x000D_
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the _x000D_
opportunity to speak with you today about securing our Northern _x000D_
Border._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Hartunian appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1019._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The U.S. Attorneys for the 16 Federal judicial districts _x000D_
along the Northern Border know well that border security is a _x000D_
critical component of our national security and work with _x000D_
Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies and _x000D_
our Canadian counterparts to combat the transnational crime _x000D_
that threatens it._x000D_
    The four districts with the largest volume of border _x000D_
crossings and significant border-related criminal activity are _x000D_
western Washington, eastern Michigan, western New York, and my _x000D_
district. The Northern District of New York shares a 310-mile _x000D_
international border with Canada and includes 8 of New York's _x000D_
11 ports of entry. A huge volume of people and goods pass _x000D_
through the Northern District from the major population centers _x000D_
of eastern Canada by road, rail, forest, field, and waterway. _x000D_
The territory of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, or Akwesasne, _x000D_
straddles the border, with portions in New York, Ontario, and _x000D_
Quebec. Smugglers exploit the circumstances at Akwesasne, the _x000D_
Seaway, and the large rural areas to cross the border _x000D_
surreptitiously._x000D_
    All along the line, criminal organizations try to take _x000D_
advantage of the nature of the border, the volume of traffic, _x000D_
the bi-national commitment to accelerate the legitimate flow of _x000D_
trade and travel and jurisdictional divisions._x000D_
    The prevention of terrorism remains, of course, our No. 1 _x000D_
priority. My family and I have personally felt the impact of _x000D_
terrorism, having lost my 21-year-old sister, Lynne, in the _x000D_
skies over Lockerbie in the December 1988 bombing of PanAm 103. _x000D_
The terrorist threat is current and real, as dramatically _x000D_
illustrated by the Canadian convictions last month of two men _x000D_
for conspiracy to murder for the benefit of a terrorist group. _x000D_
They plotted to derail a passenger train traveling between New _x000D_
York and Toronto, but were thwarted by a joint investigation _x000D_
that included undercover work by an FBI agent._x000D_
    U.S. Attorneys' Offices work closely with the 12 Joint _x000D_
Terrorism Task Forces operating at and beyond the border and _x000D_
their Canadian counterparts to spot and stop terrorism, _x000D_
understanding that our vigorous enforcement of the Federal _x000D_
criminal code--prosecuting human traffickers, child exploiters, _x000D_
and those who smuggle drugs, guns, illegal immigrants, and _x000D_
cash--reduces the threat of another attack._x000D_
    Our national effort to combat transnational crime includes _x000D_
initiatives promoting coordination and collaboration, such as _x000D_
the Integrated Border Enforcement Teams, the Border Enforcement _x000D_
Security Task Forces, and Shiprider, all led by DHS, and DEA-_x000D_
led drug task forces. Each of the four busiest districts has a _x000D_
BEST, and Shiprider is expanding eastward after establishing _x000D_
regular operations on the maritime borders in Washington and _x000D_
Michigan._x000D_
    Drug organizations use boats, helicopters, snowmobiles, and _x000D_
vehicle compartments to cross the border without detection of _x000D_
their illicit cargo--Ecstasy or high-potency marijuana moving _x000D_
south, and cocaine, firearms, and cash moving north. For _x000D_
example, in northern New York, we recently dismantled a ring _x000D_
that regularly transported hockey bags filled with 100 to 250 _x000D_
pounds of Canadian marijuana across the Seaway through _x000D_
Akwesasne for distribution in the Northeast and seized 16 _x000D_
handguns headed for Canada._x000D_
    Another group we dismantled obtained Ecstasy in Montreal _x000D_
and regularly delivered 50,000 pills to wholesalers in New York _x000D_
and Boston, returning with cash and several kilos of cocaine._x000D_
    In the fight against human trafficking, a joint _x000D_
investigation by RCMP and HSI into the smuggling of young _x000D_
Romanian women through the United States to Montreal for _x000D_
prostitution recently resulted in charges in Canada and the _x000D_
United States._x000D_
    We cooperate to combat child exploitation, like the case _x000D_
where a defendant was charged in Canada when he tried to bring _x000D_
in child pornography but did not show up for trial. So we took _x000D_
the case, and the defendant was convicted and sentenced to _x000D_
imprisonment for 225 months for transporting nearly 4,000 _x000D_
images and over 100 videos of graphic child pornography._x000D_
    As these cases illustrate, the existing enforcement teams _x000D_
and task forces have had significant successes, but their _x000D_
structure, composition, and mandates have left them short of _x000D_
true integration. The Beyond the Border declaration in 2011 _x000D_
included the commitment ``to build on existing bilateral law _x000D_
enforcement programs to develop the next generation of _x000D_
integrated cross-border law enforcement operations.'' With our _x000D_
Canadian counterparts, we are addressing the issues associated _x000D_
with integrated enforcement. Meanwhile, the vital work of _x000D_
advancing border security goes on, and now includes the Border _x000D_
Operations Leadership Team (BOLT), which brings together _x000D_
operational leaders from law enforcement and prosecution _x000D_
agencies with border missions for their insights and action on _x000D_
measures to enhance our efforts to eradicate cross-border _x000D_
crime._x000D_
    We are confident that our bilateral commitment to border _x000D_
security, our mutual respect for national sovereignty, and our _x000D_
shared tradition of protecting both public safety and _x000D_
individual rights will strengthen our efforts to achieve more _x000D_
integrated cross-border enforcement. We are committed to _x000D_
continued vigilance, using the full range of investigative _x000D_
tools and laws available to us. With BOLT's operational charge, _x000D_
the Northern Border U.S. Attorneys and Federal law enforcement _x000D_
agencies are poised to capitalize on the historic opportunity _x000D_
to forge bonds with our Canadian counterparts that increase our _x000D_
effectiveness._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity to describe for you the _x000D_
challenges we are facing on the Northern Border. I look forward _x000D_
to answering your questions. Thank you."
2925481,2925480,2925482,19241,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Hartunian. I thank all the _x000D_
witnesses for your testimony._x000D_
    Certainly one of the purposes of this hearing is to try and _x000D_
give some sense for where our main problems occur. We have _x000D_
limited resources, but we have the Southern Border, we have the _x000D_
Maritime Borders, we have the Northern Border. So I would like _x000D_
to go to you, Chief Fisher, and first just talk about in _x000D_
general the basic extent of the problems. The stats I have are _x000D_
that on the southwest border we had 480,000 apprehensions of _x000D_
people crossing into this country illegally; on the Northern _x000D_
Border, a little over 3,000. Obviously even though we have a _x000D_
much larger border, the bigger problem in terms of illegal _x000D_
immigration is coming through the Southern Border._x000D_
    In testimony, we have had contradictory testimony on this. _x000D_
That apprehension rate, according to the Customs and Border _x000D_
Protection, is about 75 percent, is what we believe we are _x000D_
apprehending. We have had some BP agents say it is somewhere _x000D_
between 30 and 40. Again, I realize it is very difficult to get _x000D_
that number._x000D_
    Do we have some sense of what the apprehension rate is on _x000D_
the Northern Border?"
2925482,2925481,2925483,19241,1,"    Mr. Chairman, the effectiveness rate is _x000D_
primarily used on the Southern Border because at that point _x000D_
along the Southern Border, years ago we have defined the _x000D_
threat, among other things, as flow, flows of people. On the _x000D_
Northern Border, that is not necessarily the case. The threat _x000D_
is defined in different ways. So using an effectiveness rate _x000D_
like we do on the Southern Border to the Northern Border really _x000D_
does not make a lot of sense to us._x000D_
    What we do do when we take a look at our strategy and _x000D_
looking to where should we deploy our finite resources, we _x000D_
looked a few years ago, and if you take a look at approximately _x000D_
90 percent of the Canadian population lives within 100 air _x000D_
miles of the border, and then you take that 4,000 miles and _x000D_
look where the density of population areas are where _x000D_
transnational criminal organizations and potential people _x000D_
seeking entry between the ports of entry need to operate, it is _x000D_
very concentrated in some of those areas. Our resourcing _x000D_
deployments and redeployments try to match those areas, and it _x000D_
is driven primarily by intelligence."
2925483,2925482,2925484,19241,1,"    OK, but, again, is your sense that we _x000D_
really do apprehend a higher percentage on the Northern Border _x000D_
versus the Southern Border or less? Again, I would ask anybody _x000D_
else who would want to chime in on that one."
2925484,2925483,2925485,19241,1,"    We do not measure that in terms of the _x000D_
effectiveness rate, sir. My sense would be it is at or higher _x000D_
than the Southern Border, primarily because the flow rate is so _x000D_
low."
2925485,2925484,2925486,19241,1,"    What about in terms of drug trafficking? _x000D_
Do we have any statistics in terms of the total number of tons _x000D_
coming from the Southern Border versus the drugs being _x000D_
trafficked through the Northern Border? Is it 10 percent? Is it _x000D_
5 percent?"
2925486,2925485,2925487,19241,1,"    I do not have the percentage off the top of my _x000D_
head, Mr. Chairman, but I will tell you it is considerably less _x000D_
in terms of the smuggling that occurs between the ports of _x000D_
entry on the Northern Border than what we see on the Southern _x000D_
Border."
2925487,2925486,2925488,19241,1,"    Again, we have had testimony from General _x000D_
McCaffrey, for example, on the Southern Border, estimates _x000D_
somewhere between 5 to 10 percent of all drugs are interdicted, _x000D_
which means, 90 to 95 percent are getting through. Would we _x000D_
have a similar type of interdiction rate on the Northern _x000D_
Border? Anybody want to answer that that might have some sense _x000D_
of that? Or do we simply not know?"
2925488,2925487,2925489,19241,1,"    Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with the _x000D_
General's methodology on that. Generally when we look at _x000D_
seizure rates along the Northern Border versus the Southern _x000D_
Border, we do not measure that in terms of the comparison to _x000D_
differentiate threat."
2925489,2925488,2925490,19241,1,"    In terms of the drugs that are flowing _x000D_
through, we have had, again, contradictory testimony on the _x000D_
Southern Border. We have had one witness saying that the _x000D_
majority of those drugs flow through the actual ports of entry. _x000D_
Other witnesses say, no, they go around the ports of entry. Do _x000D_
we have any sense on the Northern Border where the primary drug _x000D_
trafficking is occurring? Are they smuggled literally through _x000D_
the ports of entry with lack of detection? Or are they coming _x000D_
through the vast, unmonitored parts of the border? Anybody want _x000D_
to answer that one? Mr. Spero."
2925490,2925489,2925491,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator. One of the things that I would say _x000D_
about the flow of drugs on the Northern Border is it is _x000D_
certainly bi-directional. So certain drugs are coming in from _x000D_
Canada, certain types of drugs are still coming in from Canada, _x000D_
and other drugs are being exported from the United States and _x000D_
going from the United States into Canada._x000D_
    As far as the difference between whether or not we are _x000D_
making investigations at drugs being interdicted either at the _x000D_
port of entry or between the ports, we are seeing both, just in _x000D_
some cases different drugs._x000D_
    The case that I spoke about during my oral statement was a _x000D_
case where the tractor-trailer that was being used by the drug-_x000D_
smuggling organization to get cocaine from the Ontario-_x000D_
California part--or where the drugs were being stored at the _x000D_
warehouse was actually being transported across the United _x000D_
States and through the port of Buffalo and was supposed to be _x000D_
delivered to Canada. That particular method was in a trap or a _x000D_
concealed compartment. It was actually under the floor boards _x000D_
of the tractor-trailer. Had that particular delivery been _x000D_
successful, that would have been a case of drug smuggling going _x000D_
into Canada through the ports of entry._x000D_
    But, likewise, we still see smuggling--I believe it was Mr. _x000D_
Hartunian and Mr. Rodriguez who were talking about the hockey _x000D_
bags coming across in between the ports, whether those are _x000D_
hockey bags with marijuana or some other kind of drug. We get _x000D_
referrals from both the Border Patrol who make those _x000D_
interdictions between the ports as well as we do from the _x000D_
Office of Field Operations who are making those interdictions _x000D_
at the ports. So we are seeing a mix from Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations, sir."
2925491,2925490,2925492,19241,1,"    One huge difference between the borders, _x000D_
south versus north, is the cooperation of the bordering _x000D_
country. We obviously have far greater cooperation between the _x000D_
United States and Canada than we have with the United States _x000D_
and Mexico, which makes our job a whole lot easier. On March _x000D_
16, 2015, we entered into or signed an agreement on land, rail, _x000D_
marine, and air transport preclearance, which is going to _x000D_
require legislation on both sides of the border here. But, _x000D_
Chief Fisher, can you just speak to the difference between the _x000D_
cooperation we have with the Mexican Government versus the _x000D_
cooperation we have with the Canadian Government and what an _x000D_
enormous difference that makes?"
2925492,2925491,2925493,19241,1,"    Well, information for us is the key to be able _x000D_
to reduce any vulnerabilities, regardless of what border we are _x000D_
talking about. And in particular with Canada, what we have _x000D_
found over the years is the information sharing is really good. _x000D_
It gets better. I had the opportunity to have three Border _x000D_
Patrol agents that are embedded with the RCMP in Canada, with a _x000D_
fourth to come along shortly this year. And having a Border _x000D_
Patrol agent in Canada working with the RCMP only bolsters our _x000D_
ability to understand the evolving threats and helps us secure _x000D_
the border on both sides."
2925493,2925492,2925494,19241,1,"    So that type of model that we have with _x000D_
Canada, if we could implement something similar in Mexico, it _x000D_
would make a tremendous difference?"
2925494,2925493,2925495,19241,1,"    Yes, Mr. Chairman, it would."
2925495,2925494,2925496,19241,1,"    OK. Thank you, Chief Fisher. Senator _x000D_
Carper."
2925496,2925495,2925497,19241,1,"    Senator, you raise a really interesting point _x000D_
and very important point in terms of our strategy along the _x000D_
Northern Border. You are right, a lot of times people look at _x000D_
the Northern Border deployments with an eye toward the south _x000D_
and say, ``How come you are not deploying that way?''_x000D_
    I will tell you, in terms of technology, whether it is _x000D_
handheld sensing equipment, unattended ground sensors, remote _x000D_
video surveillance systems, the type of technology that we _x000D_
deploy along the Southern Border is the same along the Northern _x000D_
Border. Our enforcement posture in response to some of those _x000D_
tips and cues may be different; however, our ability to _x000D_
increase that situational awareness is the same in terms of our _x000D_
strategy of the implementation._x000D_
    What is, at least for us, very exciting on the Northern _x000D_
Border, because of the vast terrain, because of the remoteness _x000D_
of some of these locations and our inability to access the _x000D_
immediate border, whether it is because of lack of _x000D_
infrastructure or roads, or because of the impediments which _x000D_
the terrain provides, we have and will start this year the _x000D_
collection effort that we are doing along the Southern Border, _x000D_
which, in fact, we started back in March 2013, and utilizing _x000D_
the unmanned aerial systems, utilizing additional VADER _x000D_
technology and synthetic aperture radar. We have targeted over _x000D_
this past year about 80 percent of the Northern Border from the _x000D_
field chiefs identifying those very remote locations for us to _x000D_
start doing collection against those areas to be able to do a _x000D_
before and after picture._x000D_
    And so think of it in terms of a 30-mile stretch along the _x000D_
Northern Border, and the unmanned aerial system will go out and _x000D_
deploy, and it will take a series of videos along those remote _x000D_
areas. Twenty-four hours later, that unmanned aerial system, _x000D_
along with the same technology, will do the same flight._x000D_
    Now, those before and after videos will then be sent into a _x000D_
computer at what we call a processing exploitation and _x000D_
dissemination cell, and there, very smart and very talented _x000D_
analysts will take a look and see if there has been any change, _x000D_
incursions, if you will, across that border from the first _x000D_
picture to the next picture._x000D_
    That gives us a sense on whether or not, one, we have _x000D_
incursions; two, whether those areas are emerging threats; or, _x000D_
equally important, what we find along the Southern Border, _x000D_
areas where there is no activity for a variety of reasons, _x000D_
which is equally important, where not to deploy technology and _x000D_
Border Patrol agents so that we can focus on those areas that _x000D_
we know, based on intelligence, based on experience, where _x000D_
those crossings are more likely to occur."
2925497,2925496,2925498,19241,1,"    We currently have approximately nine unmanned _x000D_
aerial systems within the CBP inventory. There are currently _x000D_
two that are assigned to North Dakota. That does not _x000D_
necessarily mean we can only fly to there. We do what is called _x000D_
``federated flights,'' so we can move those unmanned aerial _x000D_
systems from the Northern Border to the Southern Border based _x000D_
on identified threats. And because of the capability to run _x000D_
federated queries, we also have through the Federal Aviation _x000D_
Administration (FAA) the Certificates of Authorization to be _x000D_
able to move across from the Northern to the Southern border _x000D_
based on threats."
2925498,2925497,2925499,19241,1,"    Primarily it would be two. In the event we _x000D_
needed to plus that up for a variety of reasons, we would be _x000D_
able to augment that."
2925499,2925498,2925500,19241,1,"    That I do not know, sir. Again, as you _x000D_
indicated, weather permitting, just like any other manned _x000D_
system, whether it is a helicopter or fixed-wing, the weather _x000D_
is going to be a limiting factor and the readiness rate on when _x000D_
those can fly."
2925500,2925499,2925501,19241,1,"    I will do that. Yes, Senator."
2925501,2925500,2925502,19241,1,    Yes.
2925502,2925501,2925503,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, thank you for that question, _x000D_
which is important. The first thing I think you are doing, _x000D_
which is to call attention to the Northern Border, and we are _x000D_
grateful for the Committee's attention on this issue. There are _x000D_
a lot of challenges we face up there, but as you could tell, I _x000D_
think we are doing some good work. We have great geographic _x000D_
challenges, a lot of big space. But, as I think about some of _x000D_
the things that could be helpful to us in our work with the _x000D_
Canadians, we have had great challenges that have come about in _x000D_
recent years as a result of the explosion of requests for _x000D_
information, formerly the MLAT requests. And we are seeing more _x000D_
and more of those. Information in investigations is frequently _x000D_
needed from computer systems and e-mails, and while we are _x000D_
taking great steps to improve our informal information-sharing _x000D_
efforts and protocols, we are still seeing an explosion in MLAT _x000D_
requests. And so support for perhaps our Office of _x000D_
International Affairs in that effort, Congress working with us."
2925503,2925502,2925504,19241,1,"    Yes, for the record."
2925504,2925503,2925505,19241,1,    We have other Senators.
2925505,2925504,2925506,19241,1,"    Thanks, Senator Carper. Senator Booker."
2925506,2925505,2925507,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, I cannot speak to that issue _x000D_
directly, but I can tell you, your point is well taken, and _x000D_
that is, public safety and the threat of terrorism, that is our _x000D_
No. 1 priority. We ought to be mindful of that. We are very _x000D_
concerned about it every day. And to address it, I think we _x000D_
have been working closely with the Canadians._x000D_
    One of the things that we have been doing is to integrate _x000D_
more closely with the Canadian prosecution teams, and we have _x000D_
been talking to them more frequently, meeting with them and _x000D_
sharing information, not just between the agencies, with the _x000D_
agents and with the prosecutors. So it is a very important _x000D_
point that you make."
2925507,2925506,2925508,19241,1,"    Senator, I am not really familiar with their _x000D_
position on that, but I will tell you that in the realm of _x000D_
criminal cases and criminal work, we have had good luck with _x000D_
interaction and sharing."
2925508,2925507,2925509,19241,1,"    With respect, Senator, I believe John Wagner is _x000D_
prepared to answer that question."
2925509,2925508,2925510,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator. The FBI owns the watchlist _x000D_
for the U.S. Government, and as users of that watchlist or any _x000D_
other information they could glean from another country, we _x000D_
certainly as the operator would welcome that information. We do _x000D_
have fairly robust sharing procedures with our counterparts in _x000D_
Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). We have _x000D_
officers embedded in each of our different targeting centers _x000D_
where we go through airline reservation data and airline _x000D_
manifests to identify national security threats. And we have _x000D_
protocols to exchange information in cases when we see that._x000D_
    Now, most of the watchlisted individuals we see traveling _x000D_
are through commercial aviation still. The preponderance of _x000D_
watchlisted individuals is still coming via commercial _x000D_
aviation, and we have seen the incidents over the past number _x000D_
of years, focused primarily on commercial aviation, between the _x000D_
Underwear Bomber, the Shoe Bomber, et cetera. We do see a _x000D_
couple hundred a year, though, cross through the Northern _x000D_
Border as well."
2925510,2925509,2925511,19241,1,"    Yes, so we set protocols to exchange when each _x000D_
of us identify a threat through our commercial aviation _x000D_
targeting. We have the protocols established to exchange that _x000D_
information and request additional information from each other _x000D_
to do that, and that is where we have our liaisons situated and _x000D_
physically present at each of our different targeting centers _x000D_
to be able to facilitate that exchange of that information._x000D_
    We also do a lot of what we call rules sharing or joint _x000D_
rule creation where, as we sift through the reservation data in _x000D_
the airline information, we create rules on what we are looking _x000D_
for, what we would consider to be activity we would want to _x000D_
look closer at, and we sit down with the Canadian Government _x000D_
and actually come up with joint rules between the two of us so _x000D_
we can really go through a North American approach on how we do _x000D_
that."
2925511,2925510,2925512,19241,1,"    Yes, and we have articulated those needs in the _x000D_
administration's 2015 and 2016 budget requests through a _x000D_
workload staffing model that measures the activity, at least at _x000D_
the ports of entry, and the workload and the volume and _x000D_
attributes a staffing number to be able to accomplish that. So _x000D_
we are happy to follow up afterwards on how that methodology _x000D_
works and what those numbers are."
2925512,2925511,2925513,19241,1,"    And if I may, Senator, one of the things that _x000D_
Homeland Security Investigations is looking at is that when _x000D_
there are plus-ups along either the Southwest Border or the _x000D_
Northern Border from either our sister agencies and our _x000D_
counterparts in Office of Field Operations at the port or _x000D_
between the ports under Chief Fisher, a plus-up in CBP, Border _x000D_
Patrol, or inspectors is logically going to result in more _x000D_
interdictions, which could also result in more referrals for _x000D_
the need for investigators and more investigative work. So we _x000D_
would ask that the Committee--and it would not just affect us _x000D_
because as we undertake more, invest in border-related or _x000D_
transnational criminal organization-related investigations, _x000D_
then that would affect Mr. Hartunian and the Department of _x000D_
Justice (DOJ) prosecutorial resources as well._x000D_
    So we would ask the Committee to look at it as integrated _x000D_
agencies, how each one affects the other."
2925513,2925512,2925514,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Sasse."
2925514,2925513,2925515,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator. That is an excellent _x000D_
question._x000D_
    First of all, ``operational control'' was defined back in _x000D_
2004 in our previous strategy as the extent to which we were _x000D_
able to identify, develop, track, and bring to a law _x000D_
enforcement resolution all entries along the border. The _x000D_
fundamental premise within the 2004 strategy was predicated on _x000D_
deterrence. So you wanted to prevent the entry in the first _x000D_
instance all across the board._x000D_
    And so we started getting additional technology like border _x000D_
mile fence, which, by the way, we measured in a linear fashion, _x000D_
and we started deploying Border Patrol agents in the same _x000D_
manner and technology in the same manner._x000D_
    Operational control as a default equaled the amount of _x000D_
technology deployments that we were doing. In other words, if _x000D_
you had 5 more miles of fence and cameras, it was acceptable _x000D_
based on our internal definitions of the levels of control to _x000D_
be able to count that as operational control. The difficulty _x000D_
came in two different areas. First and foremost is we were _x000D_
actually measuring the inputs. We were not necessarily _x000D_
measuring the outcomes as a result of those deployments. And, _x000D_
second, at some point in time, which it did, those resourcing _x000D_
capabilities ran out, and so we could not as an organization _x000D_
then come back to this Committee or others and say, ``Well, we _x000D_
cannot gain any more operational control based on our _x000D_
definitions unless you give us more stuff.''_x000D_
    And so we abandoned it because it did not measure what we _x000D_
needed it to measure, and we switched to a risk-based approach _x000D_
to then take a look at measuring the probability of individuals _x000D_
coming across the border versus just the mere possibility, _x000D_
which the previous strategy was predicated to be able to secure _x000D_
the border in that fashion."
2925515,2925514,2925516,19241,1,"    Senator, again, I would defer the answer to _x000D_
that question to John Wagner, who is responsible for the port _x000D_
of entry operations."
2925516,2925515,2925517,19241,1,"    Thank you. Yes, that equipment is still in _x000D_
place, and we are working with the Domestic Nuclear Detection _x000D_
Office as part of DHS to look at the recapitalization of that _x000D_
and what is the right equipment to purchase and design and _x000D_
build and deploy to be able to do that. We are looking at the _x000D_
calibration settings of the equipment, reducing what we call _x000D_
the ``nuisance alarms,'' to really better focus on what the _x000D_
threats are and what our operational protocols in response to _x000D_
them are."
2925517,2925516,2925518,19241,1,    I do not necessarily agree with that.
2925518,2925517,2925519,19241,1,"    The equipment functions as it was designed to _x000D_
do. It looks at detecting what it was designed to do. I am not _x000D_
familiar offhand with the report or how they drew that _x000D_
conclusion; to say it would be easy to do, whether it would be _x000D_
open or concealed or how it would be detected, I would really _x000D_
have to go back and look at that."
2925519,2925518,2925520,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, in my experience as the _x000D_
Department has matured since 2003, what we have heard so far _x000D_
this morning in terms of integrated planning and execution, _x000D_
sharing of intelligence and information, the more as time goes _x000D_
on, the more dependent all of us are fighting the same fight on _x000D_
each other to be able to do this. No component within the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security owns the corner market on _x000D_
protecting America. We are so dependent, and each and every day _x000D_
it becomes clear when John and I sit up and we get our _x000D_
intelligence briefing every morning about the evolving threat. _x000D_
And that is a really key thing as a takeaway._x000D_
    This threat changes all the time, and we have to be able to _x000D_
be as responsive and perhaps more predictive as we start seeing _x000D_
those changes, which is the reason why a couple of years ago _x000D_
CBP transitioned into integrated counternetwork operations as a _x000D_
strategic philosophy, which basically means we are not just _x000D_
going to put Border Patrol agents every 25 meters and fence in _x000D_
front of them and then cameras behind them and, again, try to _x000D_
deter somebody from coming across. Pragmatically, again, in my _x000D_
28 years' experience, that does not work for a couple of _x000D_
reasons._x000D_
    One, as a strategic objective, if you have deterrence as a _x000D_
goal, one, you are always going to fail because somebody will _x000D_
always come through. And, No. 2, it is very difficult to _x000D_
measure. So if you are trying to figure out if you are _x000D_
deterring more people this year than last year, it gets very _x000D_
difficult to really understand. At least I get mired up in all _x000D_
the statistics to try to understand whether, in fact, we are _x000D_
winning._x000D_
    And so when we look at the intent and capability which _x000D_
defines the threat of those adversaries, be they transnational _x000D_
criminal organizations or terrorism or, as the 2011 strategy to _x000D_
combat transnational organized crime introduced, the _x000D_
convergence of TCOs and terrorism, those are the things that _x000D_
our organization within the Department of Homeland Security are _x000D_
trying to get better each and every day."
2925520,2925519,2925521,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator Sasse. Senator Peters."
2925521,2925520,2925522,19241,1,"    Thank you, and it is a couple of programs that _x000D_
we have that we really need to push and further get _x000D_
participation in. In the trade environment, it is our trusted _x000D_
trader programs; it is linking it to the Canadian programs; it _x000D_
is getting more companies and more businesses and more trucking _x000D_
companies enrolled in them. But it is also building the _x000D_
infrastructure then to support the crossings and allowing us to _x000D_
deliver on the promise that we can expedite those low risks or _x000D_
secure supply chains, and it just cannot be over, say, the _x000D_
bridge structure or through the border crossing. You have to _x000D_
have the resulting highways to feed into that, to support that. _x000D_
And it is, getting a higher percentage of transactions into _x000D_
those programs._x000D_
    On the traveler environment, it is the NEXUS program. It is _x000D_
getting more travelers into those NEXUS lanes, getting _x000D_
preapproved so you can go back and forth much easier. It is _x000D_
less time we spend on these ``enrolled populations,'' as we _x000D_
call them. It allows us to better focus on everyone else. So _x000D_
getting those percentages up, but also having the _x000D_
infrastructure to support, and allowing us to then deliver on _x000D_
the promise that we make them of this facilitated or expedite _x000D_
crossing to do that._x000D_
    And then it is working closely with the Canadian _x000D_
Government, looking at ways to increase the use of facilitative _x000D_
technology, most notably like the Radio-Frequency _x000D_
Identification (RFID)-enabled traveler documents, looking at _x000D_
can we get a higher saturation of those types of documents, _x000D_
because those save us time at the border. They save us _x000D_
resources because we do not have to physically handle the card _x000D_
and read it through the reader. It reads automatically. We have _x000D_
seen great strides on the U.S.-Mexico border by getting a _x000D_
higher saturation of RFID-enabled lanes. It allows us to then _x000D_
do the watchlist queries automatically as the car pulls up. And _x000D_
then building the infrastructure and segregating the traffic _x000D_
according to risk and/or facilitative technology, you know, _x000D_
just like the toll booths do with E-ZPass, Exact Change, and _x000D_
everyone else. NEXUS is the E-ZPass lane or the SENTRI is the _x000D_
E-ZPass lane. The Exact Change is something we call the ``Ready _x000D_
Lane,'' and that is somebody with an RFID document, but not _x000D_
necessarily vetted and preapproved like the trusted traveler _x000D_
program of NEXUS or SENTRI._x000D_
    And then everybody else goes over to the side, and there _x000D_
might be a longer wait there because, we know less about them _x000D_
or they have--a travel document does not allow us to facilitate _x000D_
their crossing. So it is really just pushing that and getting _x000D_
more people enrolled, and then the infrastructure to support _x000D_
it."
2925522,2925521,2925523,19241,1,"    No, it is additional resources also. Like I _x000D_
mentioned earlier, we have a workload staffing model that takes _x000D_
all of the activity an officer does at a port of entry, takes _x000D_
the average time it takes to do it, takes how many times a day _x000D_
it is typically done, and comes up with the amount of hours to _x000D_
run a port of entry, and divide that by the available work _x000D_
hours of an officer, and we come up with the staffing number of _x000D_
what we need to run based on the workload for that port of _x000D_
entry._x000D_
    Now, we can mitigate that need for new staff by some of our _x000D_
business transformation improvements that we make. One of our _x000D_
current efforts is the trucks pull up and are still paying _x000D_
cash, a couple of dollars in change, to pay the user fees to _x000D_
cross the border rather than buying the decal. So we are _x000D_
looking at ways could they pay that in advance online so we are _x000D_
not collecting cash in that primary booth and making change to _x000D_
deliver back to them, and the resulting savings and the _x000D_
workload savings and the time saving, that translates in to _x000D_
staff at some point._x000D_
    Then the facilities piece, we recognize the facilities are _x000D_
extremely expensive just between the facility itself, the _x000D_
staffing and the equipment needed, and then the highways to _x000D_
connect it. So a lot of coordination needed, we would like to _x000D_
see a lot of regional planning to look at crossings as a system _x000D_
of crossings rather than individual bridges or tunnels or _x000D_
crossings that sometimes compete with each other for traffic _x000D_
and for toll revenue. We would really like to see regional _x000D_
planning efforts that take them as a system of crossings, _x000D_
working with our Canadian counterparts to move that traffic _x000D_
north and south on both borders."
2925523,2925522,2925524,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator Peters. Senator _x000D_
McCain."
2925524,2925523,2925525,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, I do not know for a fact that is _x000D_
true. I am not going to dispute your report and what GAO may _x000D_
have found. I can imagine in some locations along all of public _x000D_
land there are decisions that are made within the Department of _x000D_
the Interior, Fish and Wildlife, that perhaps are antithetical _x000D_
to the policies and/or the approach that we would take in terms _x000D_
of the border."
2925525,2925524,2925526,19241,1,"    Senator, I would agree with the general's _x000D_
assessment in terms of how the assessed threat is really _x000D_
serious in terms of identifying risk along our border. I think _x000D_
that is accurate."
2925526,2925525,2925527,19241,1,    There are challenges----
2925527,2925526,2925528,19241,1,"    Yes, sir. There are challenges each and every _x000D_
budget cycle with or without sequestration. We have finite _x000D_
resources----"
2925528,2925527,2925529,19241,1,"    No, sir. It does matter to me."
2925529,2925528,2925530,19241,1,"    Senator, it does matter, yes. Thank you."
2925530,2925529,2925531,19241,1,    At times it can be very serious.
2925531,2925530,2925532,19241,1,"    I concur with the Chief. It is something we _x000D_
manage through. It is an additional challenge that can be _x000D_
distracting from the mission. It can have detrimental----"
2925532,2925531,2925533,19241,1,"    We manage through--well, we have to. We have no _x000D_
other choice."
2925533,2925532,2925534,19241,1,    It makes it more difficult.
2925534,2925533,2925535,19241,1,"    The entire process, getting a budget 6 months _x000D_
into a fiscal year, makes it more difficult; looking at cuts _x000D_
arbitrarily across the board makes it more difficult."
2925535,2925534,2925536,19241,1,"    We do the best we have with the process that we _x000D_
go through."
2925536,2925535,2925537,19241,1,"    I said it makes it more difficult and more _x000D_
challenging. I do not have a number that I can put up."
2925537,2925536,2925538,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator, I do."
2925538,2925537,2925539,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator. I had mentioned earlier in terms _x000D_
of the 2011 strategy to combat transnational criminal _x000D_
organizations, and in particular the convergence, wherein that _x000D_
strategy looked at the possibility of organized crime and _x000D_
terrorism basically coming together to be able to exploit _x000D_
vulnerabilities along our border, and other areas as well. And _x000D_
we see that as an emerging threat. Our shift to taking a look _x000D_
at risk and risk mitigation as opposed to just putting Border _x000D_
Patrol agents and fence everywhere, was the reason for that as _x000D_
well."
2925539,2925538,2925540,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator. On average, over the past 3 years _x000D_
along the Southern Border in particular, just because of the _x000D_
volume, we see individuals that are represented from over 140 _x000D_
different countries."
2925540,2925539,2925541,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator."
2925541,2925540,2925542,19241,1,"    Although the vast majority is still with the _x000D_
contiguous countries of Mexico, obviously on the Southern _x000D_
Border, Central and South America, I think we saw some of that _x000D_
increased activity predominantly from countries like Guatemala, _x000D_
El Salvador, and Honduras in particular."
2925542,2925541,2925543,19241,1,    I beg your pardon?
2925543,2925542,2925544,19241,1,"    Yes, sir."
2925544,2925543,2925545,19241,1,"    Yes, sir. North Africa. Like I said, I have the _x000D_
list of 144. I do not have them with me right now, sir."
2925545,2925544,2925546,19241,1,"    It does, Senator. I would be happy to provide _x000D_
that list to you."
2925546,2925545,2925547,19241,1,"    Senator, I am confident at this point that, _x000D_
based on where we are, halfway through this year, that we will _x000D_
not see the level of unaccompanied children and levels of _x000D_
family units that we saw last year."
2925547,2925546,2925548,19241,1,"    Again, if you are defining ``significant'' as--_x000D_
if you compare that to 2010 and 2011, it will be up above those _x000D_
levels. But it is going to be down over the preceding 2 years."
2925548,2925547,2925549,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator McCain. Senator Ernst."
2925549,2925548,2925550,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator. I would say I briefly mentioned _x000D_
the IBET teams where we are working very closely, embedded in _x000D_
many cases physically in space where we can share information, _x000D_
and, equally important, not just the sharing of the _x000D_
information, is then being able to figure out what we _x000D_
collectively are going to do about that information on a _x000D_
particular threat. And if you take a look at the two countries _x000D_
and the different jurisdictional authorities and associated _x000D_
authorities that go with that, we are a lot stronger in doing _x000D_
that. And to the extent that we can expand not just the concept _x000D_
but those teams in some of these regional concepts, I think we _x000D_
will be better for doing just that."
2925550,2925549,2925551,19241,1,"    Yes, continuing to work with CBSA and other _x000D_
colleagues in Canada as they develop additional targeting and _x000D_
information-sharing systems. They are working on a system much _x000D_
like our ESTA system for visa waiver travelers, their _x000D_
preapproval of that, and working with Canada to build a similar _x000D_
system really so we have a North American approach and _x000D_
consistent targeting and identification of national security _x000D_
factors; and then sharing and exchanging the ways and the _x000D_
protocols on how we can address those at the earliest possible _x000D_
opportunity."
2925551,2925550,2925552,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator. Just to expand on Chief _x000D_
Fisher and Commissioner Wagner's answer, one of the things that _x000D_
I would like to call attention to is, we had talked about--and _x000D_
I believe it was Mr. Hartunian who talked about a lot of the _x000D_
leadership committees and collaboration that is going on, _x000D_
whether it is the Beyond the Border executive group or the _x000D_
Cross Border Crime Forum (CBCF) or BOLT. Those are, as I said _x000D_
before, are great ways for us to strategize, identify the _x000D_
threats, both interacting with our Canadian partners._x000D_
    But one of the things I want to expand on what Chief Fisher _x000D_
said was, in addition to the IBETs, our HSI Border Enforcement _x000D_
Security Task Forces are doing--they are making a big _x000D_
difference. They are the operators on the ground who are _x000D_
actually out doing the--conducting the investigations, making _x000D_
the search warrants on both sides of the border, and making the _x000D_
arrests and identifying and disrupting and dismantling the _x000D_
transnational criminal organizations._x000D_
    It is a great model. It is a model where we are allowed _x000D_
to--or we give our Title 19 cross-designation or essentially _x000D_
deputize Canadian law enforcement, local Canadian law _x000D_
enforcement as customs officers, and that way they can come _x000D_
into the United States and actually conduct a side-by-side with _x000D_
us, joint investigations under our close supervision, but to _x000D_
have that connectivity investigator to investigator, agent to _x000D_
agent, coordination, collaboration, and just working the cases _x000D_
together has proven to be a very successful model."
2925552,2925551,2925553,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator, they are."
2925553,2925552,2925554,19241,1,"    I would just like to highlight some of the _x000D_
other work that is going on in the Pacific Northwest, _x000D_
specifically Operation Shiprider. Basically it is an RCMP-U.S. _x000D_
Coast Guard initiative in which different officers are cross-_x000D_
designated to operate in each other's waters._x000D_
    I also wanted to highlight the fact that the State of _x000D_
Washington and the Province of BC do a yearly meeting with _x000D_
their law enforcement and trade representatives to share _x000D_
issues, problems, and resolutions on our cross-border _x000D_
trafficking. And so I think those are unique to how we operate._x000D_
    We also engage in mutual discussions with them on a _x000D_
quarterly basis in our joint management team, which has the _x000D_
oversight of the BEST and the IBET programs. And we have a _x000D_
yearly meeting coming up--it is called ``Project North Star''-_x000D_
--in Spokane, in which we will, again, sit down with our _x000D_
Canadian colleagues as well as our State and local officials _x000D_
and Federal agencies, again, to strategize and to implement _x000D_
those strategies in the near future."
2925554,2925553,2925555,19241,1,"    No. I would say the only reticence sometimes _x000D_
is in the sharing of targeted information. They have certain _x000D_
privacy rules which they have to abide by, and so sometimes _x000D_
that can be a little bit difficult. I think we talked about the _x000D_
MLATs and the information that is provided via that type of _x000D_
format. But I think those are overcome in the field with _x000D_
operational matters and between the different agencies."
2925555,2925554,2925556,19241,1,"    Senator, from a prosecutor's perspective, we _x000D_
have made great efforts and I think great strides to bring our _x000D_
prosecution teams together to address some of the challenges _x000D_
that we face when we do cross-border operations and _x000D_
investigations. Sometimes there can be challenges sharing _x000D_
information. We have to make sure we are in compliance with the _x000D_
rules of each country. Sometimes we have to make charging _x000D_
decisions. Who are we going to charge and in what jurisdiction _x000D_
are we going to charge them? And there are different _x000D_
considerations that come into play based upon the law of Canada _x000D_
or the law of the United States._x000D_
    So I think we have come a long way in bringing our _x000D_
prosecution teams together, bringing the Canadian provincial _x000D_
prosecutors and Federal crown prosecutors together with our _x000D_
U.S. Attorneys to work some of those differences out."
2925556,2925555,2925557,19241,1,"    Thank you. So we recently commissioned an _x000D_
internal work group to look at exactly that. We have a lot of _x000D_
places that are hard to fill and hard to retain staff at. So we _x000D_
are looking at what are the options at our disposal now as far _x000D_
as relocation incentives, retention bonuses, paid moves, _x000D_
promises of, limited assignments there of a couple of years, _x000D_
and then looking at what is the right options to offer at the _x000D_
different ports of entry."
2925557,2925556,2925558,19241,1,"    No, we have not. It is just a matter of finding _x000D_
the budget funds to do it and figuring out what is the right _x000D_
approach at each one of the locations."
2925558,2925557,2925559,19241,1,"    Well, we have----"
2925559,2925558,2925560,19241,1,"    No. I am happy to say that, because, I mean----"
2925560,2925559,2925561,19241,1,"    We have submitted the staffing needs as part of _x000D_
the annual budget for the last couple years. We did receive _x000D_
2,000 more CBP officers 2 years ago, and we are in the process _x000D_
of hiring them, but the need still remains for 2,624 more, and _x000D_
it is just finding ways to pay for that, and these would be _x000D_
distributed among with the workload staffing model to do that."
2925561,2925560,2925562,19241,1,    I do not believe we get their actual watchlist.
2925562,2925561,2925563,19241,1,    I do not know.
2925563,2925562,2925564,19241,1,"    The FBI manages it for us, and we are users and _x000D_
consumers of it, and we contribute to it. But we are not the _x000D_
owners of that----"
2925564,2925563,2925565,19241,1,"    It is really strengthening the information _x000D_
exchange and the access to the information that you have _x000D_
internally within, your organization or your country. We _x000D_
exchange a lot of information with the Canadian Government. At _x000D_
the land border our entry records are serving as their exit _x000D_
records and vice versa, so we can start the exchange and the _x000D_
identification of who is overstaying, and we can also see then _x000D_
who left the country._x000D_
    In the commercial aviation environment, we are doing joint _x000D_
rules creation and joint targeting efforts to look at threats _x000D_
to North America, not just necessarily the United States or _x000D_
Canada in between. But it is what access do they have to be _x000D_
able to then share with us, which brings up the watchlist."
2925565,2925564,2925566,19241,1,    I am not aware of--I do not know.
2925566,2925565,2925567,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, just so I am clear, it was not _x000D_
my intent to minimize that flow, what happened last year, by _x000D_
any stretch. And just looking at it--because it is more of a _x000D_
statistical anomaly last year. For us, it is people coming _x000D_
across the border for a variety of reasons. When we see what _x000D_
happened, for instance, last year in South Texas, what the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security did this year--and, by the way, _x000D_
I should also mention each and every year over the last 3 years _x000D_
we have seen increases from individuals from Central America _x000D_
coming between the ports of entry._x000D_
    What changed last year was not necessarily the seasonal _x000D_
trends. That continued almost exactly the way it has been over _x000D_
the years. What did change was the volume, and what we tried to _x000D_
do and what we did do with the Secretary's leadership is start _x000D_
looking at after July when the numbers started going down, as _x000D_
really looking back and say, one, how can we be better prepared _x000D_
not just to react to it, but really to better predict it?_x000D_
    At least it was interesting for me to see and how the _x000D_
Secretary approached this is the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security was one of three departments that had equities and _x000D_
jurisdictional authority to respond to this. When you take a _x000D_
look at Health and Human Services (HHS), that is a very big _x000D_
piece when it comes to unaccompanied children. If you look at _x000D_
the Department of Justice in terms of not just the prosecution _x000D_
but what do we do across the board between the three different _x000D_
departments, that I think was the first time in my experience _x000D_
we started seeing peaks of volumes along the border----"
2925567,2925566,2925568,19241,1,"    I just have to stop you. You used the _x000D_
words that was a ``statistical anomaly.'' No, it was far more _x000D_
than a statistical anomaly. It was a humanitarian crisis----"
2925568,2925567,2925569,19241,1,"    I do not disagree with that._x000D_
fueled by the actions of this government, this administration. _x000D_
I do not have the chart here. We have used it in other _x000D_
hearings. But we have a chart that shows really the number of _x000D_
unaccompanied children coming from Central America declining _x000D_
at, I guess call it, a manageable level, I think under 10,000. _x000D_
I do not know the exact numbers. I do not have the chart. You _x000D_
had Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals and that just shot _x000D_
up. It was cause and effect; it was very clear._x000D_
    And, by the way, in our trip down to McAllen, Texas, I want _x000D_
to commend the Customs and Border Protection and the really _x000D_
tremendous effort that they put forward to address that _x000D_
humanitarian crisis. But it continues at--what?--a 60-or 70-_x000D_
percent level. It is still a problem._x000D_
    Just having met with General Kelly--and I do not want to _x000D_
put words into his mouth, but I think he is certainly _x000D_
confirming what is my sense, that no matter what Deferred _x000D_
Action for Childhood Arrivals says, no matter what the Deferred _x000D_
Action on Parents, no matter what those memoranda, those _x000D_
Executive Actions say, it is what is the reality. And the _x000D_
reality is if you are a parent or a child in Central America _x000D_
and you send your child or you come up and you get into _x000D_
America, the bottom line is you are staying. That is what the _x000D_
coyotes are telling them; even though we have a counter-_x000D_
communications strategy to say, no, this does not apply to you, _x000D_
the reality is it does apply._x000D_
    I have to admit, as I have delved into this problem--and I _x000D_
know you are Custom and Border Protection--the conclusion I am _x000D_
really coming to is you could almost be renamed ``Custom and _x000D_
Border Processing,'' because that is certainly what I saw in _x000D_
McAllen, Texas. And as long as we continue to apprehend these _x000D_
individuals, as long as we have these incentives for people to _x000D_
come into this country--because they realize if they get here, _x000D_
they are going to be able to stay. As long as we detect them, _x000D_
apprehend them, and then process them with a notice to appear, _x000D_
and then disperse from around America into the shadows, we are _x000D_
going to continue to have that problem._x000D_
    So we need to recognize that reality, and we need to start _x000D_
addressing it. I guess this is pretty good staff work here. _x000D_
They have given me my chart, which pretty well shows the _x000D_
reality of the situation. So this is far more than a _x000D_
statistical anomaly. This is something that our immigration _x000D_
laws, Executive actions, actually caused. And until we are _x000D_
actually willing to admit that reality, we are not going to _x000D_
stop it. We are going to continue to have this human crisis _x000D_
occurring--maybe it is only 60-or 70-percent level, but it is _x000D_
still a humanitarian crisis from my standpoint._x000D_
    Do you want to respond to that at all? Tell me if I am _x000D_
wrong."
2925569,2925568,2925570,19241,1,"    Well, Senator, I do want to thank you for _x000D_
complimenting the men and women in Rio Grande Valley and _x000D_
Greater South Texas. I, too, have been down there and am very _x000D_
proud of the work that they do each and every day to protect _x000D_
this country. Thank you, sir."
2925570,2925569,2925571,19241,1,"    OK. I do want to really get back to the _x000D_
Northern Border and the drug trafficking there because, again, _x000D_
if you really take a look at the root cause of so much of our _x000D_
border insecurity, it is the insatiable demand for drugs in _x000D_
this country and what that has spawned over the last 50, 60 _x000D_
years. Really, our demand has caused so much of this problem, _x000D_
so much of this crisis._x000D_
    So I want to get some kind of sense of what is happening on _x000D_
the Northern Border, where it is flowing. Listen, I go every _x000D_
year up fishing to Canada. I have gone through those ports of _x000D_
entry. Pretty calm, a bunch of folks with fishing boats. But I _x000D_
also understand how porous that border is as well; just hop in _x000D_
a canoe and all of a sudden you are a camper, and who knows _x000D_
what you are transporting._x000D_
    So understanding we do not have the statistics--which is _x000D_
part of the problem, by the way, in evaluating how to provide _x000D_
greater security of the border. We do not have the information, _x000D_
and there is a real disparity in information, whether Customs _x000D_
and Border Protection is talking about a 70-, 75-percent _x000D_
apprehension rate versus agents on the ground saying it is only _x000D_
30 or 40 percent._x000D_
    I want to get, again, some sense of what is happening on _x000D_
the Northern Border specifically, as best as people can tell. _x000D_
And I realize you do not have exact information, but is the _x000D_
drug smuggling, is the human trafficking--would the potential _x000D_
terrorists that we are concerned about, are they going to come _x000D_
through the ports of entry? Or are they going to be coming _x000D_
through the areas in between the ports of entry? Can anybody _x000D_
address that basic question? Mr. Spero."
2925571,2925570,2925572,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator, thank you. From our _x000D_
investigations--and, again, we get a lot of referrals. A lot of _x000D_
our casework does come from referrals from either the ports of _x000D_
entry, the OFO, or between the ports from the Border Patrol. _x000D_
But not all of our investigations are referrals. Some of them _x000D_
are from our own confidential informants or from other Federal, _x000D_
State, and local partners._x000D_
    We understand that one day the vulnerability could be at _x000D_
the port. One of the ways that we look at national security is _x000D_
that it is our job to make sure that we are investigating _x000D_
criminal fraud cases when it comes to people either pretending _x000D_
or appearing, making themselves appear that they are eligible _x000D_
for an entry visa to come into the country, whether that is a _x000D_
student who is coming in under a different name or does not _x000D_
intend to go to school; or whether it is a worker who claims _x000D_
that they are going to be working at a particular job in a _x000D_
particular industry and purchased that visa; or whether it is _x000D_
in the interior where the fraudsters are trying to go to one of _x000D_
our other sister agencies, Citizenship and Immigration _x000D_
Services, to obtain a permanent residence or maybe even _x000D_
eventual U.S. citizenship by any kind of fraud._x000D_
    So through our Document and Benefit Fraud Task Forces, _x000D_
through our participation on the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, _x000D_
HSI can bring our Title 8 civil immigration authority, our _x000D_
abilities to investigate fraud, or our Title 19 customs fraud. _x000D_
We are looking at all types of vulnerabilities. We are not just _x000D_
focusing on one. So whether that is people who are flying _x000D_
directly into the country, right into the interior, but maybe _x000D_
on a fraudulent visa, or applied for asylum with some sort of _x000D_
fraudulent application, that is a big vulnerability, and that _x000D_
is something that we take seriously._x000D_
    But also some of our other national security strategies are _x000D_
to make sure that sensitive technologies are not--we use our _x000D_
export enforcement and our counterproliferation program to make _x000D_
sure the sensitive technologies are not getting outside of the _x000D_
country."
2925572,2925571,2925573,19241,1,"    OK. Again, I think what I am not getting, _x000D_
what I am not hearing is some sense for how much of the _x000D_
problems are coming through our ports of entry and, whether we _x000D_
have to beef up personnel or improve--fund them in a deficit-_x000D_
neutral fashion, or whether they are coming in between the _x000D_
ports of entry. And how do we ever get that information? I _x000D_
realize it is not the volume, so we are not, I guess, _x000D_
calculating percent apprehensions or anything else._x000D_
    Chief Fisher, would it make sense to utilize what drone _x000D_
flights we have, would it make sense to have what detection _x000D_
capabilities we do have, would it make sense based on the _x000D_
anecdotal arrest and apprehension rate to do some level of _x000D_
statistical sampling, some kind of measurement to get some kind _x000D_
of information so that policymakers, who are going to be tasked _x000D_
with allocating those scarce resources, have some sense of _x000D_
where the problem does lie on the Northern Border? Do you _x000D_
understand the issue, the information I am looking for here in _x000D_
terms of where the problem lies and what we need to do to _x000D_
really assess the extent of it and direct proper solutions?"
2925573,2925572,2925574,19241,1,"    I believe I do, Senator, and one of the things _x000D_
that--and certainly for the sake of time, I would offer up a _x000D_
briefing to you or your staff. As was mentioned earlier, it is _x000D_
not as simplistic just to say, well, it is just happening at _x000D_
the ports, or it is just happening at--the metrics that we use _x000D_
in terms of between the ports of entry, there are 12, and we _x000D_
take a look at trends, not just on the Southern Border; we take _x000D_
a look on the Northern Border, and we get, for instance, with _x000D_
John's folks and try to figure out--say, for instance, in a _x000D_
place like Swanton, what is the dynamic there in Swanton? What _x000D_
is the business model of the illicit networks that operate in _x000D_
Canada that are exploited on the U.S. border?_x000D_
    That scenario in terms of that threat is likely to be _x000D_
different than Blaine, Washington, or in Detroit. And so for us _x000D_
to just--at least for me, to simplistically say, well, it is _x000D_
just at the ports of entry or between the ports of entry, it _x000D_
really depends on the area of the border, and we do have _x000D_
methods to be able to inform our judgments on where those _x000D_
redeployments should go. And we would be happy to sit down and _x000D_
explain----"
2925574,2925573,2925575,19241,1,"    First of all, I am not asking for _x000D_
simplicity here, because I realize it does not exist."
2925575,2925574,2925576,19241,1,"    Yes, sir."
2925576,2925575,2925577,19241,1,"    This is incredibly complex, and it is _x000D_
sector by sector, and it is area by area and State by State, _x000D_
and even beyond that. Again, I realize the Montana border is _x000D_
completely different than the boundary water canoe area up in _x000D_
Minnesota and Lake Superior and Detroit. I mean, this is a vast _x000D_
border and all kinds of differences._x000D_
    So I guess what I will ask you, yes, let us do a briefing. _x000D_
I want to understand the complexity. I want to understand _x000D_
exactly what you do know about anecdotally where have we--I _x000D_
mean, have people loaded up canoes? Are they flying in in small _x000D_
planes? Are they catapulting drugs across the border like they _x000D_
do on the Southern Border, with cannon, I mean, it is just _x000D_
unbelievable, as I have delved into this situation, the number _x000D_
of methods, the ability to avoid detection, the use of the drug _x000D_
cartels, blocking off the bridges to these kids so that they _x000D_
can funnel them and put pressure, overload the system over here _x000D_
so they can divert Customs and Border Patrol so they can _x000D_
smuggle the drugs over someplace else. Trust me, I understand _x000D_
the enormous complexity of the situation. But I do not have the _x000D_
information. OK? I know it is complex, but I really do not know _x000D_
how complex. I am not sure anybody does. But if we are going to _x000D_
start crafting solutions to provide better border security, we _x000D_
need to better understand the complexity of it._x000D_
    So, again, I would look forward to a briefing."
2925577,2925576,2925578,19241,1,    I agree. Thank you.
2925578,2925577,2925579,19241,1,"    I was kind of hoping--Senator Ayotte _x000D_
wanted to come here and ask some questions. If she does not get _x000D_
here in time, let me first offer all of you the opportunity to _x000D_
make a final point. This is something Senator Carper has done. _x000D_
I learned from it. Certainly if I was a witness, I would be _x000D_
sitting here going, ``I want to make this point.'' So here is _x000D_
your opportunity to make that final point. If Senator Ayotte _x000D_
gets here, we will let her question. Otherwise, we will close _x000D_
the hearing._x000D_
    Chief Fisher, we will start with you."
2925579,2925578,2925580,19241,1,"    Senator, thank you for the consideration and _x000D_
obviously the opportunity to be here today. It was brought up a _x000D_
couple of times this morning alluding to some of the _x000D_
effectiveness of reporting in terms of what my office reports _x000D_
versus what may have been in the recent past articulated _x000D_
specifically by Mr. Cabrera. I know there have been a lot of _x000D_
questions, and for the sake of brevity, let me just say this:_x000D_
    One, I have seen what Mr. Cabrera mentioned in terms of a _x000D_
host of things: the effectiveness rate, what he is hearing, _x000D_
what the policy is based on presumably what I have directed to _x000D_
the workforce in the field, among other things. Let me state _x000D_
for the record that none of that is based on truth. It is true, _x000D_
however, that Mr. Cabrera is entitled to his opinion. He is _x000D_
not, however, entitled to his own set of facts. And I would--_x000D_
not now, but with your staff--be able to clear that and tell _x000D_
you, in fact, what the policy is by my handwriting, what the _x000D_
transition has been over the last couple of years, and what I _x000D_
expect from each and every Border Patrol agent in uniform as it _x000D_
relates to data integrity and reporting, if, in fact, there are _x000D_
any allegations of misconduct. But thank you again for the _x000D_
opportunity, Senator."
2925580,2925579,2925581,19241,1,"    I appreciate that. Again, I have a keen _x000D_
understanding of how difficult it is to get this information. _x000D_
This is not like a manufacturing setting where you can study _x000D_
it, and it is all right there. This is enormously difficult and _x000D_
enormously complex. So we are just trying to wade through that _x000D_
and trying as best as possible to describe the reality and _x000D_
trying to ascertain the truth here, knowing that you are never _x000D_
going to get the full reality or the full truth._x000D_
    So, again, we certainly do appreciate your service to the _x000D_
Nation and doing what you can to grapple with a very difficult _x000D_
situation. Deputy Commissioner Wagner."
2925581,2925580,2925582,19241,1,"    Thank you. It is really just a recognition of _x000D_
some of the economic activity that crosses that Northern _x000D_
Border, what it means to the economy of the United States and _x000D_
to Canada, looking at--within the Office of Field Operations, _x000D_
we have a huge workload of not necessarily just enforcement _x000D_
work. There is the regulatory functions. There is the _x000D_
processing, like you mentioned, of the commercial vehicles that _x000D_
cross the border, welcome our citizens home, welcoming _x000D_
visitors, tourists, business travelers into the United States, _x000D_
ensuring their compliance with all the laws and regulations._x000D_
    But, the majority of the transactions we do conduct, _x000D_
remember, every truck, every piece of cargo, every person, _x000D_
every train, every boat, everything has to be seen by a CBP _x000D_
officer and admitted and released by a CBP officer. The great _x000D_
majority of those transactions are good, law-abiding companies _x000D_
and good, law-abiding citizens and visitors. And it is layering _x000D_
our enforcement processes on top of that without stopping or _x000D_
hindering that movement back and forth and really ferreting out _x000D_
those bad actors and bad things from coming in. And that is _x000D_
where we try to apply a really dedicated and targeted effort _x000D_
based on intelligence, based on our analysis, based on our _x000D_
cooperation with our foreign partners and our partners within _x000D_
the governments at the Federal, State, and local levels to be _x000D_
able to best do that so we do not stop that commerce, because _x000D_
that will be just as devastating as an attack."
2925582,2925581,2925583,19241,1,"    I agree. Thank you, and thank you for _x000D_
your service. Special Agent Spero."
2925583,2925582,2925584,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator. I guess for my final point I _x000D_
would just like to add that I understand your frustration with _x000D_
our ability to necessarily pin down exactly or identify exactly _x000D_
where the threats are, because from an Immigration and Customs _x000D_
Enforcement or a Homeland Security Investigations point of _x000D_
view, we are aware our focus is to attack transnational _x000D_
criminal organizations, no matter what they are doing, because _x000D_
what we are finding at HSI is these organizations are smuggling _x000D_
guns, drugs, people, weapons. It is the roots that we are _x000D_
trying to identify and attack, and the organizations. That is _x000D_
why we feel like our illicit path attack strategy puts us on _x000D_
the right path._x000D_
    We are not focusing on the individual committing the crime. _x000D_
When we stop that seize, we make that big seizure, or we get a _x000D_
referral, that is the beginning of the investigation for us. _x000D_
That is not the end. It does not stop there. And what our _x000D_
strategy is is to attempt to identify the whole scope of these _x000D_
global organizations, whether it is terrorist organizations or _x000D_
other criminal organizations. So that is, reaching back and _x000D_
using our international footprint to identify the bad actors or _x000D_
members of the organization in the source countries, in those _x000D_
transit countries, here in the United States if the United _x000D_
States is the ultimate destination country, but also working _x000D_
with our Canadian partners._x000D_
    So, we are kind of changing the way that we measure _x000D_
success. I understand that the old methods of straight _x000D_
indictments, convictions, and arrests and seizures and _x000D_
comparing them to the previous years or matching up with what _x000D_
the resources are is not necessarily the best way to determine _x000D_
success. So we are moving toward a model, we have implemented a _x000D_
model where we are looking at, what are the cases that we are _x000D_
doing that are having the biggest impact on border security, _x000D_
public safety, and national security._x000D_
    So I absolutely want to thank you for holding this hearing _x000D_
and bringing attention to the Northern Border and certainly for _x000D_
giving me the opportunity to represent the men and women of _x000D_
Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations. I know that they are out there every day trying _x000D_
to do the best they can to enforce the immigration and customs _x000D_
laws of the United States."
2925584,2925583,2925585,19241,1,"    We thank them, and we thank you for your _x000D_
service. Mr. Rodriguez."
2925585,2925584,2925586,19241,1,"    Thank you, Senator. I just wanted to make a _x000D_
couple of notes from an operational perspective. Again, when we _x000D_
talked about additional resources for the Northern Border, I _x000D_
want to make sure we do not overlook our intelligence _x000D_
capabilities and the challenges that we face. And to that _x000D_
aspect, I think our most critical support that we provide our _x000D_
partners is with intel analyst support. And so I know we talked _x000D_
about agents, investigators, but I do not want to leave that _x000D_
component out as far as the need for intelligence analysts. _x000D_
They play a critical role in our investigations._x000D_
    Second, I just want to point out a few gaps that my _x000D_
partners wanted to make sure I mentioned, and that was radio _x000D_
interoperability along the border. It still continues to be a _x000D_
problem, especially in those remote areas that you are familiar _x000D_
with, as well as our radar coverage, especially over the _x000D_
Cascades where we have these deep canyons and we cannot get _x000D_
radar to look down in there. And so that also is one of the _x000D_
gaps we still need to address._x000D_
    And, finally, as far as looking at specifically drug-_x000D_
trafficking organizations, we measure our success with the _x000D_
numbers that we dismantle and disrupt, and, again, a third of _x000D_
our numbers are multinational polydrug organizations that are _x000D_
impacting not only our Southern Border but also the Northern _x000D_
Border, because we are seeing more and more of our Southern _x000D_
Border DTOs coming up and, again, as I mentioned, trafficking _x000D_
more meth and cocaine through the United States into Canada."
2925586,2925585,2925587,19241,1,"    They are businesses, and they are looking _x000D_
for additional product lines, and they are looking for _x000D_
additional markets, and they are finding them, and they are _x000D_
growing them, and they are metastasizing. It is an enormous _x000D_
problem._x000D_
    I also want to comment on the radio interoperability, what _x000D_
we hope is complete interoperability. It is consistently _x000D_
mentioned to us as a problem. It is probably not the sexiest _x000D_
technology here, but it is an incredibly important one. So we _x000D_
have definitely heard that message as well. Mr. Hartunian."
2925587,2925586,2925588,19241,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would agree we _x000D_
face all the threats that you have described, and it can be _x000D_
frustrating--threats from potential terrorists, drug smugglers, _x000D_
alien smugglers, human traffickers, you name it, and those are _x000D_
the threats that we face. I think we should think about it in _x000D_
terms of how we address those threats, and we do it in a couple _x000D_
of ways._x000D_
    First, we have to have really robust prosecution regimes, _x000D_
and I think our U.S. Attorney's Offices along the Northern _x000D_
Border, I know them all, I know their offices. They work hard. _x000D_
They bring good cases. And now that we are staffing back up _x000D_
after some of the lean budget years that we experienced, I _x000D_
think that things are looking up and the future is bright for _x000D_
us. Robust enforcement is certainly very important._x000D_
    The second thing that we need is close collaboration _x000D_
between our law enforcement agencies and with our Canadian _x000D_
counterparts. And we could use some assistance perhaps with _x000D_
some of our DOJ law enforcement agencies having resources to _x000D_
work within some of these task force formats, ATF and DEA in _x000D_
particular. But we have to work toward integration, I think, _x000D_
with our Canadian counterparts, and we are taking steps to get _x000D_
there._x000D_
    And then, finally, as you described--and this was a very _x000D_
important point--we have to address some root causes, and I _x000D_
think we have to take a comprehensive approach to the drug _x000D_
problem that we have and to the crime problem that we have. And _x000D_
that means to do other things other than just prosecute and _x000D_
incarcerate people. We cannot just do that. We have to take a _x000D_
more well-rounded approach. We have to spend effort on reentry _x000D_
and on prevention. And I think the Attorney General's Smart on _x000D_
Crime Program is well designed to take a comprehensive approach _x000D_
toward our crime problem._x000D_
    So thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I _x000D_
appreciate it."
2925588,2925587,2925589,19241,1,"    Well, thank you. We are actually working _x000D_
on right now a field hearing on high levels of incarceration _x000D_
rates--we will probably do that in Milwaukee--somewhat talking _x000D_
about the issue you raised there._x000D_
    I did want to ask you a question because coming as a _x000D_
district attorney in the Northern Border sector, when we were _x000D_
down in McAllen, we just did a Sunday drive, just driving _x000D_
around with people during off-hours, and local law enforcement _x000D_
was telling me that the fight over prosecutorial jurisdiction _x000D_
is not the fight that I would have expected. Normally I am _x000D_
hearing people, they want the collar; they want to be able to _x000D_
prosecute that criminal. That is not the case on the Southern _x000D_
Border because it is so expensive to prosecute and people's _x000D_
budgets are strained. Basically they are fighting over not _x000D_
having to prosecute individuals, and as a result, anecdotally _x000D_
we were told that unless, for example, there is at least 500 _x000D_
pounds of marijuana, they just do not even bother with _x000D_
prosecution. Now, that is on the Southern Border. As long as _x000D_
you are district attorney on the Northern Border, what are the _x000D_
jurisdictional battles? What are the types of prosecution _x000D_
thresholds, the discretion that you use?"
2925589,2925588,2925590,19241,1,"    We do have thresholds, and, typically the _x000D_
larger drug quantities are prosecuted in Federal court _x000D_
primarily. We work very closely with our local district _x000D_
attorneys, particularly along the Northern Border, the four-_x000D_
county border area in the Northern District of New York. And _x000D_
when we have a case that perhaps does not rise to the level of _x000D_
a Federal prosecution, we will consult with our State _x000D_
counterparts, and the case may end up being prosecuted in State _x000D_
court._x000D_
    I think we work collaboratively with them. I would not say _x000D_
that there is a competition or a desire to hand cases off. My _x000D_
experience is that we work very well, that we have particular _x000D_
interests and needs and priorities, and I think we can meld _x000D_
those together quite well."
2925590,2925589,2925591,19241,1,"    I have got 4 minutes left to vote. You _x000D_
have already voted, so will you close out the hearing? Is that _x000D_
okey-dokey? I am kind of a rookie here. OK._x000D_
    Let me just say again thank you all for the time you took. _x000D_
I read the testimony. It is all very thoughtful. I know there _x000D_
is a lot of work and detail that goes into it, so thank you for _x000D_
taking that time and taking your time here to come and testify, _x000D_
your very thoughtful answers to our questions, and I want to _x000D_
thank all my colleagues. This was a very well attended hearing _x000D_
which I think indicates really how importantly we view this _x000D_
problem. But it also speaks to the complexity. There is an _x000D_
awful lot of questions that need at least some answers, and I _x000D_
know those answers are very difficult to get to._x000D_
    So, again, I want to thank you, and I will turn it over to _x000D_
our Ranking Member, Senator Carper. Thank you._x000D_
hanging in here with us. At this point in time, the Finance _x000D_
Committee has been in a markup--we call it a ``business _x000D_
meeting''--on the trade legislation, Trans-Pacific Partnership, _x000D_
Trade Promotion Authority, so I am trying to be in two places _x000D_
at once and not doing it too well. And we are voting, so it is _x000D_
a full morning._x000D_
    I want to ask a question that goes back to something that--_x000D_
I do not know, Chief, if you said it or Mr. Wagner said it, but _x000D_
somebody said it, and you mentioned--maybe, Mr. Hartunian, it _x000D_
was you. But the matter of Native American lands was mentioned _x000D_
that is actually on the border between our country and Canada. _x000D_
And we have a similar situation along the border with Mexico. _x000D_
And at times I have heard from the Mexican border that _x000D_
sometimes drug smugglers, human traffickers--use that land as a _x000D_
conduit to get through and try to get the cooperation of the _x000D_
folks who own that and live on that land._x000D_
    Whoever raised this, would you and others just chime in _x000D_
about how this is of interest to us on the northern as well as _x000D_
on the Southern Border? Mr. Spero."
2925591,2925590,2925592,19241,1,"    Yes, Senator, thank you. That is true; there _x000D_
certainly are some complexities when conducting investigations _x000D_
of crime on the Native American reservations. One of the _x000D_
complexities certainly on the Northern Border in the area of _x000D_
the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation that Mr. Hartunian and _x000D_
I share jurisdiction with is just plain the geography, sir. It _x000D_
is tough terrain up there, and it is ripe for smugglers to _x000D_
exploit in all seasons. And then certainly you have that _x000D_
added--the winter months----"
2925592,2925591,2925593,19241,1,"    The Akwesasne Indian Reservation actually has _x000D_
territory both on the Canadian side and on the United States _x000D_
side, and the geography itself poses a lot of challenges toward _x000D_
law enforcement._x000D_
    On top of the geography, in addition to the geography, _x000D_
there is some political sensitivities with the Native _x000D_
population wanting to maintain as much sovereignty as they can, _x000D_
so sometimes it is difficult for us to conduct--we have to _x000D_
overcome that challenge of gaining their trust. In some cases, _x000D_
it is a very close knit, small population, and that again poses _x000D_
some issues or challenges for us that are somewhat unique._x000D_
    But, on the other hand, one of the things that is getting _x000D_
better from our standpoint and we are making a lot more _x000D_
progress is our Massena BEST up there."
2925593,2925592,2925594,19241,1,"    Our Massena Border Enforcement Security Task _x000D_
Force. We actually have the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service _x000D_
representatives on that--participate on the task force, as well _x000D_
as the St. Regis police officers on our task force. There are _x000D_
members that have been cross-designated with Title 19 _x000D_
authority, so essentially they are deputized customs agents, _x000D_
and they are working those cases with us to help reduce those _x000D_
vulnerabilities._x000D_
    In reality, we know all of the challenges I met. The _x000D_
smuggling organizations know what they are, too, and they try _x000D_
and do their best to exploit everything. So we are trying to do _x000D_
a better job with our outreach on the Indian reservation, our _x000D_
close coordination and collaboration with the Native American _x000D_
police force on that reservation, and working together to do _x000D_
everything we can to mitigate that threat, sir."
2925594,2925593,2925595,19241,2,"    Yes, Senator. As described in the Akwesasne, on _x000D_
the Tohono O'odham Reservation on the southwest border, which _x000D_
the geography takes on the western portion in Arizona, both in _x000D_
Tucson and what we call the ``West Desert,'' that tribe does _x000D_
extend in the United States and into Mexico, and so part of _x000D_
their--when we look at the border in terms of trying to _x000D_
identify likely routes of entry, over the years as we have _x000D_
built both primary pedestrian fence and vehicle barricades, it _x000D_
is always challenging to try to work with the tribe, work with _x000D_
the leadership in the tribe, and letting them know, if they _x000D_
will allow us to put some impediments along the border, or _x000D_
bring infrastructure or technology to help increase our _x000D_
situational awareness, early in those discussions years ago it _x000D_
was very difficult to make the case, until the infrastructure _x000D_
and technology started to manifest around the reservation, _x000D_
which obviously the path of least resistance came through the _x000D_
Tohono O'odham Nation._x000D_
    As a matter of fact, up until the middle of 2013, the vast _x000D_
majority of trafficking across the Southern Border came through _x000D_
Arizona, and the vast majority of that traffic came through the _x000D_
West Desert through the Nation. They realize the vulnerability, _x000D_
and we are working a lot better with them._x000D_
    As a matter of fact, we are currently in the process of _x000D_
developing integrated fixed towers. The first phase of that, as _x000D_
you well know, was in Nogales. In late summer, we are in the _x000D_
process going to transition into Phase 2, and we currently have _x000D_
authorization from the tribe to be able to move into deployment _x000D_
of integrated fixed towers to cover a vast region of that _x000D_
reservation. So that will be for us something that has been a _x000D_
long time in coming, sir."
2925595,2925594,2925596,19241,2,"    Yes, thank you, Senator. Great question. _x000D_
What is working? Robust enforcement. And that is not to say _x000D_
that is not happening on the Southern Border. I think our U.S. _x000D_
Attorney's Offices all along the border are working very hard. _x000D_
Their people, their AUSAs, are really working hard to get the _x000D_
job done. But it is certainly a critical component._x000D_
    I think what works on the Northern Border is close _x000D_
collaboration with the Canadians, and while that might be a bit _x000D_
more challenging in Mexico, I think it can be done, and close _x000D_
collaboration between the prosecutors of both nations, and that _x000D_
is something that we are seeing happen more and more. We are _x000D_
working to improve that, make that happen more frequently, and _x000D_
I think that that is certainly an important approach that we _x000D_
can take. So I would highlight those two things."
2925596,2925595,2925597,19241,2,"    Well, I think that there is cooperation with _x000D_
the Mexican authorities. I think in all cases we have to be _x000D_
careful how we share law enforcement information. That is _x000D_
certainly not a barrier that cannot be overcome."
2925597,2925596,2925598,19241,2,    All right. From my----
2925598,2925597,2925599,19241,2,"    For 27 years, Senator."
2925599,2925598,2925600,19241,2,"    From my perspective, it is just not the one _x000D_
meeting, the one event, the one policy discussion. We have a _x000D_
number of conversations both with our Federal partners on the _x000D_
border as well as with Canadians year-round. It could be case _x000D_
specific. It could be program specific. And if we have to, we _x000D_
then follow up on these discussions where we will put a working _x000D_
group together to work on maybe some Shiprider issues or some _x000D_
intel issues that we need to look at specifically MDMA, or _x000D_
Ecstasy._x000D_
    And so I think those are the best practices that work well _x000D_
for us on the Northern Border and that makes us unique, and _x000D_
that we need to keep going and hopefully we can eventually have _x000D_
those types of processes in place on the Southern Border to _x000D_
help there."
2925600,2925599,2925601,19241,2,"    Senator Carper, I appreciate the question. I _x000D_
actually had a little bit of extra time to formulate my answer, _x000D_
and I guess the best way for me to describe it or the way I _x000D_
look at it is that it is not necessarily how do we take what is _x000D_
working on the Northern Border and bring it down to the _x000D_
Southern Border. But it is an exchange of best practices across _x000D_
both borders as well as the interior of the United States. And _x000D_
I use the Border Enforcement Security Task Forces, as an _x000D_
example. The BEST was originally created in Laredo in 2005 to _x000D_
combat the violence associated with the transnational criminal _x000D_
organizations that were affecting specifically the Southern _x000D_
Border._x000D_
    That model, the success of that model, with the _x000D_
collaboration and cooperation and working together on the cases _x000D_
was then brought up to the Northern Border, and now we have _x000D_
four Northern Border BEST task forces. I happen to oversee two _x000D_
in my AOR of Buffalo, the Port of Buffalo BEST as well as the _x000D_
Massena BEST._x000D_
    But at the same time, it does not just stop there. We do _x000D_
not bring what we have learned from the southwest border and _x000D_
bring it up to the Northern Border. We had a framework, a great _x000D_
framework to start with, but then we take that to the next _x000D_
level, so our abilities to expand those BESTs, we actually have _x000D_
over 40--just about 43 members now of our BEST team in Massena. _x000D_
So our abilities to incorporate our Canadian law enforcement _x000D_
counterparts at all levels, whether it is the RCMP or the CBSA, _x000D_
but the Surete du Quebec or the regional police offices, and _x000D_
having as much--not just information sharing, because, of _x000D_
course, information sharing is extremely important, but we are _x000D_
able to actually take the information in those collaboration _x000D_
sessions and put them to use in our investigations. And that is _x000D_
how we complete that last piece of identifying, disrupting, and _x000D_
dismantling the transnational criminal organizations that are _x000D_
the biggest threats to the homeland."
2925601,2925600,2925602,19241,2,"    Senator, at the ports of entry, really we focus _x000D_
on the risk segmentation of the workload and looking at ways to _x000D_
better utilize the physical infrastructure that is there and _x000D_
getting the most efficiencies we can out of it._x000D_
    Now, how we define something as lower risk or higher risk _x000D_
is all dependent on what access to what systems we have, the _x000D_
analysis and the targeting capabilities. That is also enhanced _x000D_
by what our foreign partners are sharing with us. We have very _x000D_
good data exchange, information exchange with the Canadian _x000D_
Government and the Mexican Government. They have different _x000D_
capacities as to what access they can get, what information _x000D_
they collect, and then within their own privacy constraints _x000D_
what they can share with us. But it is a little different _x000D_
within both countries, but we do a very robust information _x000D_
exchange with the Mexican Government as well as the Canadian _x000D_
Government that helps us make that risk segmentation _x000D_
determination."
2925602,2925601,2925603,19241,2,"    Yes, Senator. You mentioned it briefly. I think _x000D_
it is the institutionalization of what we see on the Northern _x000D_
Border in terms of shared information, integrated percentage _x000D_
and execution, which then you have a degree of sustainability _x000D_
in that effort. We can do a lot better on the Southern Border _x000D_
in that regard._x000D_
    Thank you, Senator."
2925603,2925602,2925604,19241,2,"    Thank you, Senator. Well, with specifics to _x000D_
heroin, you are right, we are seeing heroin that is coming up _x000D_
through Mexico, and the intelligence that we are developing _x000D_
from our ongoing criminal investigations and our closed _x000D_
investigations is that, we are seeing either precursor _x000D_
chemicals or heroin coming from China. It is being imported _x000D_
into Mexico under the control of the cartels. The cartels are _x000D_
using the existing smuggling networks to get them into the _x000D_
United States through the southwest border, and whether the _x000D_
smuggling networks are used to smuggle anything, so whether it _x000D_
is people or whether it is drugs, the cartels have control of _x000D_
the networks and the pathways, and they are using that to get _x000D_
heroin into the country for either ultimate consumption here in _x000D_
the United States or in some cases on into Canada as well._x000D_
    One of the things that we were talking about was our _x000D_
ability and our need to make sure that we do everything that we _x000D_
can across all levels of law enforcement, whether it is _x000D_
Federal, State, or local law enforcement, or in my particular _x000D_
neck of the wood, even travel law enforcement, and _x000D_
international law enforcement as well, particularly with our _x000D_
Canadian counterparts on the Canadian side of the border._x000D_
    Where we have the biggest issues in my particular AOR, the _x000D_
Massena or Rouses Point area, we use our Border Enforcement _x000D_
Security Task Forces as a mechanism to share information back _x000D_
and forth with our Canadian counterparts._x000D_
    So we actually have cross-designated--we have given _x000D_
essentially Title 19 or customs authority basically making _x000D_
State and local law enforcement designated customs officials, _x000D_
but also we are able to do that with Canadian local law _x000D_
enforcement officials as well. And then they can come and work _x000D_
the networks on this side of the border._x000D_
    So the idea here is to open up information sharing, work _x000D_
the cases together, instead of--not only trying to remove the _x000D_
U.S.-Canadian border as a potential barrier to law enforcement, _x000D_
or in some cases we are even actually able to use it to our _x000D_
advantage. So we understand that it is a problem. Heroin seems _x000D_
to be on the rise. But one of the things that we think is the _x000D_
best way to identify, disrupt, or dismantle these transnational _x000D_
criminal organizations, no matter what commodity they smuggle, _x000D_
whether it is heroin, whether it is cocaine, or whether it is _x000D_
marijuana--or firearms, for that matter--is to identify the _x000D_
scope of the organization in the source countries, the transit _x000D_
countries, the destinations countries, and work together with _x000D_
law enforcement at all levels to share the information and work _x000D_
the cases."
2925604,2925603,2925605,19241,2,"    One of the things that we look at in any of the _x000D_
drug trade, whether it is heroin, and I should have also _x000D_
mentioned before that, the newer trends that we are seeing with _x000D_
respect to heroin is the heroin laced with fentanyl, which is _x000D_
really the deadliest----"
2925605,2925604,2925606,19241,2,"    Absolutely, ma'am. As with any business model, I _x000D_
think that, if we can be more effective at reducing the supply, _x000D_
then that would be one way to drive up the price._x000D_
    Another thing that we are trying to do is with almost every _x000D_
enforcement program that we have at Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations, there is also a public outreach or a public _x000D_
service announcement message that goes along with it. So if we _x000D_
do have a particularly big search warrant, where there is a big _x000D_
seizure or a big arrest or a big sentence, we try and get out _x000D_
to the public that, hey, if it is the kids that are using the _x000D_
heroin laced with fentanyl, to get out there and say, look, _x000D_
there are some--you do not know what you are using or what the _x000D_
impacts are on you. So not only did we just conduct this _x000D_
investigation and make this arrest, but, parents, kids, this is _x000D_
why it is important that you do not use it because you do not--_x000D_
--"
2925606,2925605,2925607,19241,2,"    I do not know if they have direct access to the _x000D_
U.S. Government watchlist and that they screen against that _x000D_
directly. But they have a similar system that we do of _x000D_
screening airline passengers against the airline reservation _x000D_
systems and the airline manifests before that person comes into _x000D_
that country. We work very closely with them, and we identify _x000D_
similar approaches to how we screen that. We call them _x000D_
``rules,'' and we set rules against how we scrub that data and _x000D_
how we identify national security or any other types of _x000D_
concerns. We do joint rule creation. We do rules exchanges, and _x000D_
we have certain protocols in place that when certain rules _x000D_
fire, we will exchange information and ask each other country _x000D_
about additional information."
2925607,2925606,2925608,19241,2,"    It is against their own systems and their own _x000D_
list, so they do, I believe, have a national security list. _x000D_
They have customs records. They have immigration lookouts. They _x000D_
have access to the Interpol lost and stolen database."
2925608,2925607,2925609,19241,2,"    We do not own that information, so it really _x000D_
would not be ours to exchange with them. But as consumers and _x000D_
users of it, we would certainly welcome access to any _x000D_
additional sources of information."
2925609,2925608,2925610,19241,2,"    Just one final point. If somebody does fly into _x000D_
Canada and drive across the border, we run the same database _x000D_
checks and the same watchlist checks at the land border as we _x000D_
do in commercial aviation. They are the same systems and the _x000D_
same databases we are checking."
2925610,2925609,2925611,19241,2,    Correct.
2925611,2925610,2925612,19241,2,    Correct.
2925612,2925611,2925613,19241,2,"    Thank you, Senator Ayotte. That is a _x000D_
really good point. My understanding is the same as yours, that _x000D_
they are not using our watchlist, and that is something I think _x000D_
we need to press to see what we can do to cooperate between two _x000D_
governments."
2925613,2925612,2925614,19241,2,"    Correct. So, again, thank you for coming. _x000D_
Again, thank you all for your time, your efforts, and your _x000D_
testimony._x000D_
    This hearing record will remain open for 15 days until May _x000D_
7 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions for _x000D_
the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2925614,2925613,2925615,19241,4,"    This hearing will come to order. Our _x000D_
Ranking Member is still a few minutes out, so we will get _x000D_
underway here. When he gets here, I will express again the fact _x000D_
that we are very glad that Senator Carper's stop was in _x000D_
Wilmington. He was actually on the train that derailed, and, of _x000D_
course, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and _x000D_
victims of that tragedy. And our thoughts and prayers are also _x000D_
with all of our law enforcement officials that step out on _x000D_
their doorstep every day and risk their lives for our public _x000D_
safety. And rather than me say it, I cannot say it better than _x000D_
what Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a letter, and I would just _x000D_
like to read this._x000D_
    ``Dear Colleagues: This is National Police Week. This week, _x000D_
we honor the sacrifice and commitment of men and women in our _x000D_
law enforcement. We pay special tribute to those in law _x000D_
enforcement who have given their lives in the line of duty, and _x000D_
we offer our support to their families.''_x000D_
    ``Last year, our Department lost two Border Patrol agents _x000D_
in the line of duty: Alexander Giannini and Tyler Robledo. This _x000D_
week, Agents Giannini and Robledo's names will be added to the _x000D_
National Law Enforcement Officers (NLEO) Memorial in _x000D_
Washington, DC.''_x000D_
    ``I am also mindful of Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, _x000D_
Jr., who last August was killed during a robbery while fishing _x000D_
with his family in Texas.''_x000D_
    ``Wherever you are this week, I encourage you to honor _x000D_
those who have chosen the law enforcement profession.''_x000D_
    I guess I would just ask everybody here in the hearing _x000D_
room, in light of and in honor of those individuals that _x000D_
Secretary Johnson was commending, as well as all of our law _x000D_
enforcement officials that have given their last full measure, _x000D_
just if we recognize a moment of silence."
2925615,2925614,2925616,19241,5,    I do.
2925616,2925615,2925617,19241,5,    I do.
2925617,2925616,2925618,19241,5,    I do.

today._x000D_

    \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Borkowski appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1131._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I represent the acquisition community, and our _x000D_
responsibility is to deliver the stuff that the operators need. _x000D_
We buy it. I know there is some question about the distinction _x000D_
between us and, for example, DHS Science and Technology (S&T), _x000D_
so let me highlight that a little bit to start._x000D_
    DHS S&T makes sure there is stuff there, because it is not _x000D_
always ready. We do not always have systems, technologies, _x000D_
software that we need. So it first has to be there. Once it is _x000D_
there, we have to figure out how best to get it, and that means _x000D_
we have to know what the options are. We have to do the _x000D_
business case analysis. We have to figure out how many to buy. _x000D_
And we have to understand why we are buying it. And for that, _x000D_
of course, we ask the people in uniform, the green, or the tan, _x000D_
or the blue uniforms, the folks sitting to either side. They _x000D_
are the ones who describe what we need. It is our job then in _x000D_
Acquisition to somehow put that in practice and actually _x000D_
deliver capability that those operators can use to produce _x000D_
mission outcomes._x000D_
    Our focus, the thing we have gotten the most attention on _x000D_
recently, has been the technology for surveillance between the _x000D_
ports of entry. As you know, there is a past program called the _x000D_
Secure Border Initiative-network (SBInet), which was a very _x000D_
challenging program, and although it eventually delivered very _x000D_
effective capability, we concluded it was not the right system _x000D_
to go across the entire border, and it was much too expensive._x000D_
    So we scaled down our ambitions somewhat and selected a _x000D_
much more modest portfolio of systems that the Border Patrol _x000D_
selected and tailored to each area of the border. We focused _x000D_
that on Arizona because that is where the action was at the _x000D_
time. We are in the throes of completing that plan, which we _x000D_
call the ``Arizona Technology Plan,'' and it consists of _x000D_
everything from small--you can imagine handheld, long-range, _x000D_
binocular-like sensors, to more complex systems on high towers _x000D_
with radars and cameras that are connected in a command and _x000D_
control center. And the purpose of those systems is to give the _x000D_
Border Patrol better information about what is on the ground, _x000D_
what the threat of that activity is, whether it is a migrant or _x000D_
it is somebody carrying a weapon, and more options for how to _x000D_
respond._x000D_
    Outside of Arizona, obviously, the Border Patrol has _x000D_
indicated to us that there is activity, that there is _x000D_
migration. As we have done things in Arizona, traffic has _x000D_
migrated or for a variety of other reasons. South Texas, as you _x000D_
know, is an area._x000D_
    What we have done is because we were successful in the _x000D_
Arizona Technology Plan, at least in saving money, we have been _x000D_
able to divert resources to South Texas, and largely that has _x000D_
been based on the Department of Defense (DOD) reuse. Congress _x000D_
has been a strong advocate of us partnering with the Department _x000D_
of Defense to use what was already taxpayer investments, to _x000D_
leverage those for our capacity, and we have been very _x000D_
successful with that in South Texas. For example, we are flying _x000D_
aerostats now, and we now have surveillance that we probably _x000D_
would not have had until 2018 or 2019 with budget realities._x000D_
    So that is a quick summary of our progress and what _x000D_
Acquisition does, and I very much look forward to answering _x000D_
your questions as we go forward."

    This is a special week in Washington, culminating in the _x000D_
National Police Officers Memorial on Friday on the South _x000D_
Capitol Lawn._x000D_
    Earlier today, we observed Chief Fisher, the Commissioner, _x000D_
the Deputy Commissioner, the Deputy Secretary, and the _x000D_
Secretary commemorate the valor of CBP's fallen, specifically _x000D_
in the unveiling of two new names on the CBP Valor Memorial, _x000D_
Border Patrol Agents Giannini and Robledo. We honor them and _x000D_
the 115 other guardians of the Nation's lost in 2014._x000D_
    While the basic Border Patrol mission to secure the _x000D_
Nation's borders from illegal entry of persons and goods has _x000D_
not changed in the past 90 years, the operational environment _x000D_
in which we work and the threats we face have changed _x000D_
dramatically._x000D_
    Today our mission includes deterring acts of terrorism, _x000D_
detecting and intercepting human and drug and weapons smuggling _x000D_
and trafficking, and preventing and responding to other _x000D_
criminal activity. The effective deployment of fixed and mobile _x000D_
technology and tactical infrastructure is critical to Border _x000D_
Patrol operations. With these resources, our front line is more _x000D_
informed, more effective, and safer._x000D_
    The Border Patrol works closely with our operational _x000D_
intelligence, technology development, and acquisitions _x000D_
colleagues within CBP and DHS to develop requirements to test, _x000D_
evaluate, and ultimately deploy technology and infrastructure._x000D_
    The deployment of tactical infrastructure, including _x000D_
fencing, roads, and lighting, is a critical component of our _x000D_
security efforts. It denies, deters, and slows down illegal _x000D_
entrants, providing more time for agents to respond. Detection _x000D_
technology supplements physical barriers by extending the _x000D_
visual range and awareness of agents. Ground sensors alert _x000D_
agents to movements and activity while mounted cameras and _x000D_
sensors on aircraft, fixed towers, and on Border Patrol _x000D_
vehicles can be controlled remotely to verify targets._x000D_
    All of this technology and infrastructure works together _x000D_
and ultimately enables the Border Patrol to gain situational _x000D_
awareness, direct a response team to the interdiction location, _x000D_
and forewarn of any danger otherwise unknown along the way._x000D_
    The Border Patrol continually evaluates our situational _x000D_
awareness posture and adjusts our capabilities to secure our _x000D_
borders. We work closely with OTIA and CBP and DHS' Science and _x000D_
Technology Directorate to identify and develop technology such _x000D_
as tunnel detection and monitoring technologies, small unmanned _x000D_
aircraft systems, tactical communication upgrades, and border _x000D_
surveillance tools tailored for the southwest and northern _x000D_
borders._x000D_
    There is no doubt that technology is a critical factor in _x000D_
the Border Patrol's Strategic Plan, which implements a security _x000D_
approach based on risk. The strategy going forward will _x000D_
emphasize joint planning and execution, advancing _x000D_
counternetwork approach, and a DHS-wide unity of effort._x000D_
    Thanks again for the opportunity to testify how technology _x000D_
and tactical infrastructure help us secure the border."

    The Science & Technology Directorate's, mission is to _x000D_
deliver effective and innovative insight, methods, and _x000D_
solutions for the critical needs of the Homeland Security _x000D_
Enterprise._x000D_
    Under the leadership of Under Secretary Brothers, S&T has _x000D_
refined our strategic direction and defined our visionary goals _x000D_
which are driven by the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security _x000D_
Review (QHSR), White House policy, congressional guidance, and _x000D_
Secretary Johnson's Unity of Effort Initiative. These goals _x000D_
are:_x000D_
    Screening at Speed: Security that Matches the Pace of Life;_x000D_
    A Trusted Cyber Future: Protecting Privacy, Commerce, and _x000D_
Community;_x000D_
    Enable the Decision Maker: Actionable Information at the _x000D_
Speed of Thought;_x000D_
    Responder of the Future: Protected, Connected, and Fully _x000D_
Aware;_x000D_
    And Resilient Communities: Disaster-Proofing Society._x000D_
    Three of these goals are directly relevant to border _x000D_
security: Screening at Speed, Enable the Decision Maker, and _x000D_
Responder of the Future. All three require a common enabler--_x000D_
namely, situational awareness--in order to screen people and _x000D_
goods with minimum disruption to the pace of life, enable _x000D_
decisionmakers at various levels, and arm responders with _x000D_
information to keep them safe and fully aware._x000D_
    From an operational standpoint, given our broad border _x000D_
against a multitude of ever changing threats, the need for _x000D_
total situational awareness is paramount. S&T employs _x000D_
technology as a powerful force multiplier to improve _x000D_
situational awareness, which in turn enables risk-based _x000D_
security, a key DHS strategy._x000D_
    Considering both S&T visionary goals and today's _x000D_
operational needs, we are pursuing an enterprise capability to _x000D_
provide improved situational awareness across the Homeland _x000D_
Security Enterprise called the ``Border and Coastal Information _x000D_
System,'' (BACIS). This work includes integrating and _x000D_
federating existing stand-alone data sources, developing new _x000D_
sensor systems to create new data, developing and integrating _x000D_
decision support tools and analytics to translate data into _x000D_
actionable information, and sharing information with partners._x000D_
    Development for the BACIS is ongoing for the maritime _x000D_
environment. Work for our land borders started in fiscal year _x000D_
(FY) 2015, and work for our ports of entry is planned for _x000D_
fiscal year 2017. Toward blocking gaps in border situational _x000D_
awareness and providing new data sources, numerous S&T-_x000D_
developed systems are undergoing operational assessment while _x000D_
providing interim capability. Examples include a buried _x000D_
tripwire system in Arizona to detect illegal border crossers, a _x000D_
tunnel activity monitoring system in Texas, a Canada-U.S. _x000D_
sensor sharing pilot, and a prototype system for detecting and _x000D_
tracking small dark aircraft in Washington. In operational use _x000D_
in Texas is a scanner that scans small aircraft for contraband._x000D_
    Technology is an essential ingredient of effective border _x000D_
security. S&T will continue to collaborate with our components _x000D_
and partners to bring technology to operational use and help _x000D_
enhance border security._x000D_
    I thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity to _x000D_
testify on this very important subject."

2925628,2925627,2925629,19241,5,"    Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson and Members _x000D_
of the Committee I appreciate the opportunity to testify at _x000D_
today's hearing to discuss GAO's work reviewing DHS efforts to _x000D_
acquire and deploy various technologies and other assets along _x000D_
U.S. borders._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Gambler appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1153._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    DHS has employed a variety of assets in its efforts to _x000D_
secure the southwest border, including various land-based _x000D_
surveillance technologies, tactical infrastructure, which _x000D_
includes fencing, roads, and lighting, and air and marine _x000D_
craft. GAO has reported on DHS' management and oversight of _x000D_
these assets and programs, including numerous reports on _x000D_
surveillance technologies under the former Secure Border _x000D_
Initiative and the current Arizona Border Surveillance _x000D_
Technology Plan. GAO has also reported on fencing and other _x000D_
tactical infrastructure with about 652 miles of pedestrian _x000D_
vehicle fencing currently in place along the southwest border._x000D_
    My remarks today will reflect our findings in three areas _x000D_
related to DHS' efforts to secure the border: one, DHS' efforts _x000D_
to implement the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan; _x000D_
two, CBP and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) _x000D_
efforts to modernize radio systems; and, three, CBP Office of _x000D_
Air and Marine's mix and placement of assets._x000D_
    First, CBP has made progress toward deploying programs _x000D_
under the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan, _x000D_
including fixed and mobile surveillance systems, agent portable _x000D_
devices, and ground sensors, and these technologies have aided _x000D_
CBP's border security efforts. However, we have also reported _x000D_
that CBP could do more to strengthen its management of the plan _x000D_
and technology programs and better assess the contributions of _x000D_
surveillance technologies to apprehensions and seizures along _x000D_
the southwest border._x000D_
    For example, CBP has experienced delays in some of its _x000D_
surveillance technology programs, and CBP's planned dates for _x000D_
initial and full operational capabilities for the integrated _x000D_
fixed towers, for instance, have slipped by several years._x000D_
    We have also previously reviewed CBP's schedules and life-_x000D_
cycle cost estimates for its highest-cost programs under the _x000D_
plan and compared them against best practices. Overall, the _x000D_
schedules and estimates for the plan's programs reflected some _x000D_
but not all best practices, and we found that CBP could take _x000D_
further action to better ensure the reliability of its _x000D_
schedules and cost estimates by more fully applying best _x000D_
practices._x000D_
    Further, CBP has identified the mission benefits of its _x000D_
surveillance technologies such as improved situational _x000D_
awareness and agent safety. CBP has also begun requiring Border _x000D_
Patrol to record data within its database on whether or not an _x000D_
asset such as a camera assisted in an apprehension or seizure. _x000D_
These are positive steps; however, CBP needs to develop and _x000D_
implement performance measures and analyze data it is now _x000D_
collecting to be able to fully assess the contributions of its _x000D_
technologies to border security._x000D_
    Second, with regard to radio systems, earlier this year we _x000D_
reported that CBP and ICE had taken action to upgrade their _x000D_
tactical communications infrastructure. For example, CBP and _x000D_
ICE completed various modernization programs for their tactical _x000D_
communications such as upgrading outdated equipment and _x000D_
expanding coverage in some areas. However, agents and officers _x000D_
who use the radio systems reported experiencing challenges such _x000D_
as coverage gaps and interoperability issues which affected _x000D_
their operations. We also found that CBP and ICE could take _x000D_
further steps to strengthen and record training on upgraded _x000D_
radio systems provided to officers and agents._x000D_
    Third, with regard to air and marine assets, in 2012 we _x000D_
reported that the Office of Air and Marine could better ensure _x000D_
that its mix and placement of assets were effective and _x000D_
efficient by, for example, more clearly linking deployment _x000D_
decisions to mission needs and threats, documenting analyses _x000D_
used to support decisions on the mix and placement of assets, _x000D_
and considering how deployments of border technology affect _x000D_
requirements for air and marine assets. We found that these _x000D_
steps were needed to help CBP better determine the extent to _x000D_
which its allocation decisions were effective in addressing _x000D_
customer needs and threats._x000D_
    In closing, we have made recommendations to DHS in all of _x000D_
these areas and others to help the Department in its efforts to _x000D_
manage and implement technologies, infrastructure, and other _x000D_
assets to secure the border. DHS has agreed with some of these _x000D_
recommendations and has actions planned or underway to address _x000D_
some of them. We will continue to monitor DHS' efforts in _x000D_
response to our recommendations._x000D_
    Thank you again for inviting me to testify, and I would be _x000D_
pleased to answer any questions at the appropriate time."

  TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL JOHN GARCIA,\1\ LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY, _x000D_
    CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE, U."
2925630,2925629,2925631,19241,5,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper, and Members of the Committee. I am honored to be _x000D_
testifying before you today regarding the legal authorities and _x000D_
requirements related to the deployment of fencing and other _x000D_
barriers along the U.S. borders._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Garcia appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1175._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The primary statute governing barrier deployment is Section _x000D_
102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant _x000D_
Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, which I will refer to as _x000D_
``the 1996 act.'' Section 102 was amended in 2005, 2006, and _x000D_
2007. These revisions, coupled with increasing funding for _x000D_
border projects, resulted in hundreds of miles of fencing being _x000D_
deployed along the southwest border. However, it appears _x000D_
additional fence deployment largely halted after 2011._x000D_
    Section 102 has three key features: Section 102(a) _x000D_
expressly authorizes DHS to deploy barriers and roads along the _x000D_
borders to deter illegal crossings. Section 102(b) provides _x000D_
that fencing shall be installed along not less than 700 miles _x000D_
of the southwest border, but fencing is not required at any _x000D_
particular location when DHS determines that other means are _x000D_
better suited to obtain control. And Section 102(c) allows the _x000D_
DHS Secretary to waive any legal requirement that impedes the _x000D_
expeditious construction of border barriers and roads._x000D_
    In recent years, attention has primarily focused on Section _x000D_
102(b) and 102(c), so I will focus my comments on those _x000D_
provisions._x000D_
    Prior to the most recent amendments to the 1996 act, _x000D_
Section 102(b) required DHS to construct double-layered fencing _x000D_
along five specific stretches of the southwest border. The _x000D_
current version of Section 102(b) no longer requires fencing to _x000D_
be double-layered and provides DHS with discretion regarding _x000D_
where fencing should be installed._x000D_
    Although Section 102(b) is sometimes characterized as _x000D_
requiring 700 miles of fencing, the provision actually states _x000D_
that fencing shall be deployed ``along not less than 700 miles _x000D_
of the southwest border.'' In other words, the requirement _x000D_
prioritizes the amount of the border covered by fencing as _x000D_
opposed to the amount of fencing used by DHS. Last year, DHS _x000D_
stated that fencing had been deployed along roughly 652 miles _x000D_
of the southwest border._x000D_
    There may be questions regarding the firmness of the 700-_x000D_
mile language. Section 102(b) states that, notwithstanding its _x000D_
requirements, DHS is not required to construct fencing at any _x000D_
particular location where it deems fencing inappropriate. This _x000D_
clause could be interpreted to mean that while DHS must deploy _x000D_
fencing along 700 miles of the border, it is not required to _x000D_
deploy fencing at any discrete point._x000D_
    A broader reading of this clause might permit DHS to _x000D_
construct fencing along less than 700 miles of the southwest _x000D_
border if the agency believes fencing is only appropriate along _x000D_
a lesser mileage. However, there are a number of challenges to _x000D_
such a reading. As an initial matter, the notwithstanding _x000D_
clause does not say that DHS may construct fencing along a _x000D_
lesser mileage of the border. It says that fencing is not _x000D_
required at any particular location. If DHS may construct only _x000D_
the amount of fencing it deems appropriate, it is unclear why _x000D_
Section 102(b) would state that fencing shall be deployed along _x000D_
not less than 700 miles of the southwest border._x000D_
    The legislative history of Section 102(b) along with _x000D_
several courts' description of the provision also seem to give _x000D_
greater support for understanding the 700-mile requirement as a _x000D_
firm one. DHS officials have seemingly taken differing _x000D_
interpretations of Section 102(b) over the years. A court's _x000D_
consideration of this issue may depend upon whether the meaning _x000D_
of Section 102(b) is seen as ambiguous and DHS' construction is _x000D_
deemed reasonable._x000D_
    In any event, there is no statutory deadline for when the _x000D_
required fencing must be completed, and it is also unclear who _x000D_
would have standing to bring a legal challenge against DHS' _x000D_
fencing strategy._x000D_
    Turning to Section 102(c), this provision grants the DHS _x000D_
Secretary the power to waive legal requirements that may impede _x000D_
the construction of border roads and barriers. Waiver authority _x000D_
has been used to facilitate both the construction and the _x000D_
upkeep of border projects. But this authority could not be used _x000D_
to waive constitutional requirements. Thus, for example, just _x000D_
compensation needs to be given to private property owners whose _x000D_
land is condemned for purposes of barrier installation._x000D_
    This concludes my prepared statement. I will be happy to _x000D_
answer any questions you have."
2925631,2925630,2925632,19241,5,"    Thank you, Mr. Garcia._x000D_
    I am kind of interpreting your testimony that Congress _x000D_
might have passed a law that was not crystal clear? I guess I _x000D_
would be shocked._x000D_
_x000D_
              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BOOKER_x000D_
_x000D_
    Senator Booker, I guess you are going to have to leave _x000D_
here, so I am happy to turn it over to you for the time being."
2925632,2925631,2925633,19241,5,"    So I think that is a very important question, _x000D_
Senator, and it goes to something that GAO has reported on both _x000D_
as it relates to fencing but also as it relates to other assets _x000D_
as well to include technology, which you mentioned, which is _x000D_
really being able to assess what we are getting out of _x000D_
different investments that we are putting in place along the _x000D_
border, whether it is fencing or technology. And what we have _x000D_
found and reported on is that DHS could do a better job of _x000D_
collecting data and developing measures and metrics to assess _x000D_
what contributions they are getting out of different _x000D_
investments, whether that is fencing or whether that is _x000D_
technology or other assets._x000D_
    And so what we have recommended is that DHS take steps to _x000D_
better collect the data, and better develop performance _x000D_
measures and metrics, so that we can be able to answer the _x000D_
question you just asked, which is: What are the contributions _x000D_
that we are getting out of the different infrastructure and _x000D_
technologies that we are putting in place?"
2925633,2925632,2925634,19241,5,"    And DHS certainly has some data now that would _x000D_
allow them to assess, particularly on the technologies front, _x000D_
what contributions they are getting out of the technologies _x000D_
they have deployed to seizures and apprehensions, for example, _x000D_
for the towers that have already been deployed, they are _x000D_
starting to collect that data now, and what they need to do is _x000D_
start using that to actually analyze and assess the performance _x000D_
and progress they are making."
2925634,2925633,2925635,19241,5,"    We certainly think it is important for them to _x000D_
assess the performance of the systems and how that is _x000D_
contributing to their efforts to secure the border, both as it _x000D_
relates to fencing technology and other assets they might put _x000D_
in place."
2925635,2925634,2925636,19241,5,"    Thank you, Senator Booker._x000D_
    We would like to turn it over to our Ranking Member. Again, _x000D_
we are all very pleased on the Committee that you got off in _x000D_
time. So if you would like to say a few words and give us your _x000D_
opening statement?_x000D_
_x000D_
              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER"
2925636,2925635,2925637,19241,5,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. You will enjoy _x000D_
our hearing next week talking about the 30-year deficit and _x000D_
those projections, and we will certainly address those issues _x000D_
you were just raising._x000D_
    As I was speaking to the witnesses--and, again, thank you _x000D_
for coming here, and I appreciate your thoughtful testimony and _x000D_
all the time you have put into it. If you are going to solve _x000D_
any problem, you really do need the information. That is really _x000D_
the basis of all these hearings, is to just lay out that _x000D_
record, lay out the reality. A number of times in testimony we _x000D_
have already talked about having the data. We have had a number _x000D_
of Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports. We had one on _x000D_
OAM, and we will get into that a little bit later. We just had _x000D_
one issued today on the lack of data driving decisions based on _x000D_
prosecutorial discretion and Deferred Action on Childhood _x000D_
Arrivals (DACA)._x000D_
    Those are serious issues in terms of not having the _x000D_
information. I would say one of the things that is frustrating _x000D_
to me as this Committee has really delved into the whole issue _x000D_
of immigration reform and border security is just, especially _x000D_
as an accountant, as a guy from a manufacturing background, _x000D_
just not having good, solid information and data--recognizing, _x000D_
though, it is pretty difficult to obtain that. But we try and _x000D_
do it through testimony, from getting good opinions._x000D_
    Chief Vitiello, I do have to start out with a little _x000D_
housekeeping because we were made aware I think earlier today _x000D_
that one of our witnesses, Border Agent Chris Cabrera, received _x000D_
a notice to appear before CBP Internal Affairs for this _x000D_
Thursday. They want to talk to him about his congressional _x000D_
testimony. Now, my Lutheran catechism tells me to put the best _x000D_
construction on it, so I am hoping the reason Internal Affairs _x000D_
wants to talk to Agent Cabrera is that they are a little _x000D_
concerned about some of his testimony that might vary with some _x000D_
of the information we get from DHS in general, potentially _x000D_
talking about the fact that, he testified to us on the _x000D_
``gotaways,'' that there is a certain level of, I guess, _x000D_
informal, potential intimidation if they report more than 20 _x000D_
people coming through and they only apprehend 10 and all of a _x000D_
sudden a supervisor is there and providing a lot of scrutiny._x000D_
    So, again, I am highly concerned about that. We bring _x000D_
people before this Committee. We swear them in. We swear them _x000D_
in to tell the truth, and I do hope that this is an effort to _x000D_
understand what his testimony was and try and determine whether _x000D_
there are some real distortions in terms of the information and _x000D_
the data that we are going to need to solve this problem. So I _x000D_
hope I have your commitment and the commitment of Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection's management that this is not any kind of _x000D_
intimidation or retribution."
2925637,2925636,2925638,19241,5,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that _x000D_
observation. The question, it is, in fact--your impression is _x000D_
correct. We were very concerned about Chris' testimony. We are _x000D_
very concerned about the numbers. We want you, we need _x000D_
ourselves to have the data to be as accurate as possible. And _x000D_
Chris, we work with him very well. We work with the National _x000D_
Border Patrol Council to the extent that we need to and have _x000D_
to. They are good partners. They have been for us, and we want _x000D_
their testimony to reflect accurately what happens in the _x000D_
field. And he left the suggestion and impression that there was _x000D_
intimidation or misconduct going on in regards to how the data _x000D_
is collected. That is not my impression. I am quite sure that _x000D_
the agents and their supervisors and the management of the area _x000D_
where Chris was discussing in McAllen are focused on doing the _x000D_
right thing for the right reasons. And so we did, in fact, _x000D_
refer the remarks to the Office of Internal Affairs for getting _x000D_
to the bottom of whether or not there was misconduct in that _x000D_
area._x000D_
    Again, it is my impression that that is not what our _x000D_
leadership and our managers do down there, but it helps for us _x000D_
to verify."
2925638,2925637,2925639,19241,5,"    Good. That is very good news, and we will _x000D_
be watching that._x000D_
    We were talking about all the technologies as a force _x000D_
multiplier. When we were down on the border in McAllen, _x000D_
certainly we heard the stats of Aerostats. They are only up 60 _x000D_
percent of the time, which means they are down 40 percent of _x000D_
the time. The same with the UAS. I will certainly give you a _x000D_
chance to respond to the Office of Inspector General report, _x000D_
but do we have any information in terms of what percent of _x000D_
individuals we are actually detecting? Or let me state it _x000D_
another way: What percent situational awareness do we have? We _x000D_
had Secretary Johnson here, I think it was 2 weeks ago, and he _x000D_
just made the blanket statement--and I appreciated the _x000D_
honesty--that, by the end of this administration we will not _x000D_
have achieved 100 percent situational awareness. I understand _x000D_
that. What percent are we at right now? Is there any estimate _x000D_
of that? Can anybody speak to that?"
2925639,2925638,2925640,19241,5,"    I cannot be precise as it relates to the _x000D_
situational awareness across the 2,000 miles of the southwest _x000D_
border. It is very well understood what activity levels are, _x000D_
where the hot spots for activities are, and how our deployments _x000D_
support that. And so, as appropriate for this hearing, the _x000D_
technology is very important. The data that we collect as it _x000D_
relates to that activity and our observations and the recording _x000D_
of the outcomes of those individual interdictions feeds _x000D_
information where the assets and the agents give us that real-_x000D_
time information. So in a place like downtown McAllen, where _x000D_
you visited, in downtown Brownsville, where we do have _x000D_
surveillance technology, a very robust deployment of agents in _x000D_
the downtown environment. So in real time, you can collect _x000D_
information about activity and the results of the activity, the _x000D_
results of our interdictions, which includes the people who _x000D_
were arrested, the people who ran back, and what we call _x000D_
``gotaways.''_x000D_
    In other locations, we use other methods to try and do _x000D_
that. There is lots of space along that 2,000 miles where we do _x000D_
not have that kind of deployment, so we use things like change _x000D_
detection technology to help inform overall._x000D_
    There is also a piece of situational awareness that is _x000D_
having to understand what the capabilities of the criminal _x000D_
network are, how we interact with our fellow law enforcement _x000D_
agencies, our international partners, to understand what is _x000D_
happening on the other side of the border, and putting those _x000D_
pieces together along with the observations of people who live _x000D_
along the border that tell us this is out of the ordinary, this _x000D_
is not._x000D_
    If you start to put all of those things together, it gives _x000D_
you an idea of what is happening across the entire border."
2925640,2925639,2925641,19241,5,"    OK. But, again, we are always looking for _x000D_
some kind of metric, and, certainly laws that we have passed _x000D_
call for a metric, call for a goal of 100 percent ``situational _x000D_
awareness,'' or ``operational control.'' So the question I _x000D_
have, since is certainly the idea behind some of these laws to _x000D_
specify that, are we not calculating that, are we not trying to _x000D_
track that metric now in anticipation of having potentially to _x000D_
comply with the requirement for 100 percent situational _x000D_
awareness?"
2925641,2925640,2925642,19241,5,"    So we look at a suite of data that says _x000D_
``these are the arrests'', we look at things like recidivism, _x000D_
there are other elements that we are trying to bring in the _x000D_
Secretary is focused on in the Southern Border and the _x000D_
Approaches Campaign, in the Unity of Effort, to tying the data _x000D_
together and giving us all a metric. We have struggled with the _x000D_
idea of defining situational awareness. I mean, I think it is _x000D_
one of those phrases or title that we seem to all understand, _x000D_
but when you get right down to it, how do you measure something _x000D_
that has a different connotation for different environments?"
2925642,2925641,2925643,19241,5,"    So would the position of the Department _x000D_
of Homeland Security be they would just really reject or _x000D_
certainly resist having a piece of legislation where you have _x000D_
got that metric, 100 percent situational awareness?"
2925643,2925642,2925644,19241,5,"    I think we would all enjoy having a defined _x000D_
set of circumstances that says if you have these four criteria _x000D_
met, then you do have situational awareness. We think it is _x000D_
broader. Obviously, if you have technology, a piece of _x000D_
machinery that surveils the border in real time, 24/7, that is _x000D_
an element of situational awareness. There are other pieces to _x000D_
that. It becomes difficult to decide exactly where you are at _x000D_
and what the actual definition is."
2925644,2925643,2925645,19241,5,"    While we are on this topic, before I turn _x000D_
it over to the Ranking Member, does anybody else want to _x000D_
comment on this? Ms. Gambler."
2925645,2925644,2925646,19241,5,"    We have, as I mentioned, reported on the need _x000D_
for CBP to put in place measures to assess progress made in _x000D_
securing the border. You were asking questions about sort of _x000D_
estimating flow and things like that. Our understanding--and _x000D_
certainly Deputy Chief Vitiello can speak to this perhaps _x000D_
better than I can, but those are estimates when you are talking _x000D_
about things--like the Border Patrol does record apprehensions, _x000D_
but the other data points that go into estimating flow, _x000D_
turnbacks, and gotaways, as we discussed are estimated by the _x000D_
Border Patrol."
2925646,2925645,2925647,19241,5,    Thank you. Senator Carper.
2925647,2925646,2925648,19241,6,"    I believe if we can come to terms on the _x000D_
definition for ``situational awareness,'' then you can _x000D_
constructively then go from there, recognizing what the data _x000D_
is, and say whether you have situational awareness or not, and _x000D_
then based on the activity levels, the capability that CBP and _x000D_
others bring to the border security environment, then you can _x000D_
leap from there or jump from there or work out from there to a _x000D_
secure border definition."
2925648,2925647,2925649,19241,6,"    Yes, on the Northern Border, and those feeds _x000D_
are directly shared across the international boundary."
2925649,2925648,2925650,19241,6,"    I could be precise to the record with some _x000D_
data to each of the sectors along the Northern Border."
2925650,2925649,2925651,19241,6,"    In making us more efficient? Is that how you _x000D_
mean?"
2925651,2925650,2925652,19241,6,"    Correct. Both the sensors and the aircraft _x000D_
allow for us to do more with fewer people."
2925652,2925651,2925653,19241,6,"    Yes. Under several frameworks signed by both _x000D_
leadership in the Department and at higher levels, we work with _x000D_
Canada in almost every area as it relates to border security, _x000D_
homeland security, and defense."
2925653,2925652,2925654,19241,6,"    There are a lot of programs, a lot of _x000D_
interaction day to day. We have people assigned in Canada that _x000D_
work out of my office."
2925654,2925653,2925655,19241,6,"    Typically we are on the border everywhere, _x000D_
both private and public land."
2925655,2925654,2925656,19241,6,"    In places where we know that land is private, _x000D_
there is a recognition from the landowner and that within 25 _x000D_
miles, as the job demands, we enter private land."
2925656,2925655,2925657,19241,6,"    I believe that we have recognized that that _x000D_
is part of how we are going to be successful in the _x000D_
environments that we work, having partnerships, leveraging each _x000D_
other's authority, exchanging information so that people are _x000D_
recognizing where threats are. That is always going to be part _x000D_
of the future. We have adopted that as a way forward._x000D_
    We interact quite a bit with leadership in law enforcement, _x000D_
and the Stonegarden program that Congress gave us several years _x000D_
back after the Department was created is a very useful tool for _x000D_
us, and is very well thought of by State and local."
2925657,2925656,2925658,19241,6,"    I am not aware of any deficiencies that we _x000D_
have specifically with Blackfeet."
2925658,2925657,2925659,19241,6,"    Same. We have an ongoing working relationship _x000D_
to be present and understand their concerns as well as being _x000D_
present on the border and patrolling."
2925659,2925658,2925660,19241,6,"    Correct, we do."
2925660,2925659,2925661,19241,6,    Thanks. [Laughter.]
2925661,2925660,2925662,19241,6,    Senator Carper.
2925662,2925661,2925663,19241,6,    Testifying on other things.
2925663,2925662,2925664,19241,6,"    Yes, sir, thank you for that question. There _x000D_
are, I think, a lot of lessons that we have learned about _x000D_
things we should not do. For example, we should not treat _x000D_
technology or any other capital asset as an end. It is a means _x000D_
to an end, and we often get attracted by the bright shiny _x000D_
thing, and we do not think about why or how it will help us do _x000D_
our jobs._x000D_
    Sometimes that is difficult because we do not always have _x000D_
metrics. That is because we do not have history. We are doing _x000D_
things that are new to us, and we have to understand that as _x000D_
well. We have to learn how to do things that are new to us and _x000D_
collect data and iterate on that. So that is one thing. _x000D_
Technology is a means to an end; it is not an end unto itself._x000D_
    We cannot impose technologies on people who use it. We have _x000D_
to involve them, and they have to invite us to bring _x000D_
technologies. That is a classic mistake._x000D_
    We cannot aspire to immature technologies before they are _x000D_
ready for us really to start to use them, and we do that very _x000D_
often._x000D_
    So those are all sort of acquisition lessons learned that I _x000D_
would say that we have done in the past that we need to _x000D_
remember not to do in the future."
2925664,2925663,2925665,19241,6,    Thank you.
2925665,2925664,2925666,19241,6,"    I agree with my colleagues Assistant _x000D_
Commissioners Borkowski and Alles that this is a challenging _x000D_
question, and then I think we have learned----"
2925666,2925665,2925667,19241,6,    I will take over.
2925667,2925666,2925668,19241,6,"    Let us talk about fencing. When we were _x000D_
preparing for this meeting, we got a chart\1\ up here showing _x000D_
the different types of fencing. But one of the charts I wanted _x000D_
to produce was I wanted to lay out the border, and I wanted to _x000D_
specify here are the different types of fencing along the _x000D_
lines, and I found out, well, I cannot show that because it is _x000D_
law enforcement sensitive. So I will first ask you, Chief _x000D_
Vitiello, why would the fencing and the quality of the fence _x000D_
and the type of fencing along the border be law enforcement _x000D_
sensitive? I mean, that is a secret that is not exactly a _x000D_
secret._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Johnson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1190._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2925668,2925667,2925669,19241,6,"    I really do not understand that as well. I _x000D_
think that the documents that we sent over, that we were _x000D_
trading back and forth, that we were trying to approve late in _x000D_
preparing for today's testimony were marked. I am not sure of _x000D_
the origination of those markings._x000D_
    I agree with you. If you live in a community that has the _x000D_
benefit of fencing as----"
2925669,2925668,2925670,19241,6,    You kind of know where it is.
2925670,2925669,2925671,19241,6,    That people know where it is.
2925671,2925670,2925672,19241,6,"    Plus if you are a drug smuggler, you _x000D_
definitely know where it is. You have got that all mapped out."
2925672,2925671,2925673,19241,6,"    As you start to aggregate data like that or _x000D_
images like that, you start to show a picture across the _x000D_
southwest border, and it is easier to pick out some of the _x000D_
vulnerabilities. So that may be the origination of the _x000D_
markings. But we will certainly provide what we can."
2925673,2925672,2925674,19241,6,"    Which is, of course, what I wanted, _x000D_
because I want to see where we have our strengths and where we _x000D_
have our weaknesses._x000D_
    Talk to me--and maybe--I am trying to think who would be _x000D_
best here. How effective can fencing be? And what has been the _x000D_
real problem in constructing it? We have environmental laws. We _x000D_
have eminent domain issues. We have lawsuits. We have passed _x000D_
laws that exempt ourselves from those. But what has been the _x000D_
real reality? Because, we have built close to 700 miles of _x000D_
fencing, but you can tell by the different types of fencing, _x000D_
there is some that works pretty good and some that, obviously _x000D_
might stop a truck, but certainly is not going to stop a human _x000D_
being. So just who is the best to just kind of walk about the _x000D_
history of, the multiple laws we have passed to build fencing, _x000D_
and then we relax them, set them up for discretion, they are _x000D_
not crystal clear, there is no time horizon on it. What has _x000D_
happened? We will start with Mr. Garcia, and then----"
2925674,2925673,2925675,19241,6,"    Mr. Chairman, if I understand, the first _x000D_
question you had was about possible impediments, legal _x000D_
impediments to fence construction."
2925675,2925674,2925676,19241,6,    Correct.
2925676,2925675,2925677,19241,6,"    When Congress first expressly authorized _x000D_
barrier deployment in 1996, although there was barrier _x000D_
deployment before that, it provided a waiver--DHS or I guess at _x000D_
that time the Immigration and Naturalization Service could _x000D_
waive two laws: NEPA, which concerns doing an environmental _x000D_
assessment, and the Endangered Species Act. Those two waivers--_x000D_
that waiver authority in many observers' minds was _x000D_
insufficient. The INS was required to deploy--essentially _x000D_
complete a triple-layered fencing project in San Diego, and _x000D_
over the course of 9 years, that project was not completed _x000D_
because of impediments caused by other environmental laws._x000D_
    Congress responded to that pursuant to the REAL ID Act by _x000D_
providing DHS with very broad waiver authority to waive all _x000D_
legal requirements that may impede the expeditious construction _x000D_
of barriers and roads along the border, not simply in a _x000D_
specified place like San Diego, but anywhere along the U.S. _x000D_
border."
2925677,2925676,2925678,19241,6,    Did it work?
2925678,2925677,2925679,19241,6,"    That waiver authority was exercised in five _x000D_
instances, I believe between 2005 and 2008, and that certainly _x000D_
assisted Border Patrol in expeditiously constructing hundreds _x000D_
of miles of fence along the southwest border. There were legal _x000D_
challenges brought to halt certain border projects, but when _x000D_
DHS exercised waiver authority, courts would dismiss those _x000D_
challenges._x000D_
    In terms of that waiver authority, I will note that it is _x000D_
not absolute. Besides the constitutional limitations--you _x000D_
cannot waive the Constitution. Another thing is that it refers _x000D_
specifically to the construction of barriers and roads. There _x000D_
is certainly some question as to whether it would apply to _x000D_
tactical infrastructure that is not a barrier or a road, like _x000D_
sensors or cameras._x000D_
    DHS, when it has exercised waiver authority to border _x000D_
projects, it has often mentioned things like radio towers and _x000D_
cameras in addition to the fence. But whether waiver authority _x000D_
could be used exclusively for, say, a project to install towers _x000D_
or sensors along a particular stretch of the border, DHS has _x000D_
never done that, and that would raise a question: Is that a _x000D_
barrier?"
2925679,2925678,2925680,19241,6,"    OK. Chief Vitiello, why don't you finish _x000D_
out? Then I will turn it back over to the Ranking Member."
2925680,2925679,2925681,19241,6,"    So I think we have used fencing and it has _x000D_
been part of border deployments for my entire career, and the _x000D_
images that you are showing here in the top left, the landing _x000D_
mat, that was designed, procured, and developed mostly by _x000D_
Border Patrol agents, a lot of the National Guard deployments _x000D_
were used over the years along the southwest border to build _x000D_
that fencing. Effective for short-term, surge operations when _x000D_
you are adding other things, technology, et cetera, it did us _x000D_
very well._x000D_
    The fencing that was brought to us by the changes in the _x000D_
act and the mandate to do 700 miles are more the other images _x000D_
that you show there._x000D_
    And then the vehicle barrier, as also represented there, is _x000D_
strategically placed in locations where it is very difficult to _x000D_
get to the border afoot, and so it is not necessary to have a _x000D_
pedestrian fence in places where the infrastructure does not _x000D_
support people walking toward the border._x000D_
    And so all of them have contributed to higher levels of _x000D_
security. I think on the other side of the equation, it is a _x000D_
lot more expensive than we expected when we started, and it was _x000D_
much more difficult. I was in Texas as the Chief of the Rio _x000D_
Grande Valley in 2007 through 2010, and so when I arrived on _x000D_
duty there in 2007, we helped validate and set a requirement _x000D_
for fencing--as I recall, about 75 miles. Most of that fencing _x000D_
was built, and it has made a difference. But it was not without _x000D_
lots of--excuse me? Most of it is in place, yes. It absolutely _x000D_
has made a difference. Yes, it has. But it was not without lots _x000D_
of challenges, difficulty with hydrology and flood control, et _x000D_
cetera, in South Texas, and lots of concerns about people who _x000D_
own that land, and we are still in cases in court about takings _x000D_
and condemnation, et cetera. That is part of the history. That _x000D_
is part of the lessons learned as we went through that whole _x000D_
project."
2925681,2925680,2925682,19241,6,    Thank you. Senator Carper.
2925682,2925681,2925683,19241,6,"    So as I was saying, I was agreeing with both _x000D_
my colleagues. I think some of the lessons that we have learned _x000D_
with trying to fit technology in without the proper kind of _x000D_
awareness of all of its capabilities or lack of capabilities, I _x000D_
think one of the lessons we have learned is that as we move _x000D_
into this new version of the technology laydown, we have and _x000D_
are using field input for all of the installations."
2925683,2925682,2925684,19241,6,"    So we have this process, it is called _x000D_
``capability gap analysis,'' and those in business are familiar _x000D_
with gap analysis. As a Border Patrol agent, it is something _x000D_
that is well known in this environment. It allows us to go to _x000D_
the field and do surveys and walk the ground and understand _x000D_
what threats are faced at a station level, so the agents on the _x000D_
ground who are challenged day to day and patrolling the border, _x000D_
where are their biggest problems? And what kinds of _x000D_
technologies that they either have or think that are available _x000D_
will help them solve those problems? And so we do that, a _x000D_
station-by-station look, that is rolled up into a sector _x000D_
picture, and then that is rolled up into the headquarters._x000D_
    We are in the process now of baselining the data. We have _x000D_
got about three-fourths of the workforce in the station-level _x000D_
data coming to us, and we will use that to help inform the _x000D_
plans that we have already made with OTIA, and then for unmet _x000D_
needs that we know are in the inventory, the things that work _x000D_
now that are being installed in places like Arizona will give _x000D_
us a hint of where to go next, what might be coming available _x000D_
that we can help do research on the DHS side."
2925684,2925683,2925685,19241,6,"    Vietnam, sir."
2925685,2925684,2925686,19241,6,    South.
2925686,2925685,2925687,19241,6,    Thank you.
2925687,2925686,2925688,19241,6,    Thank you for serving.
2925688,2925687,2925689,19241,6,"    Thank you for keeping me safe and free all those _x000D_
years."
2925689,2925688,2925690,19241,6,"    Yes, sir. From an S&T standpoint, I would say _x000D_
that the biggest challenge always has been how do we transition _x000D_
from a research and development (R&D) effort into acquisition. _x000D_
And it is a challenge that is not unique to just DHS. DOD has _x000D_
the same challenge, and it has been in existence a lot longer _x000D_
than DHS as well."
2925690,2925689,2925691,19241,6,"    Yes, sir. When I say it is a challenge, it does _x000D_
not mean that nothing transitions. Of course, we have _x000D_
transition in a lot of things in DHS as well as elsewhere. What _x000D_
I am trying to say is it is a challenge in the sense that the _x000D_
way the budget is structured--for example, I will give you a _x000D_
very specific example. Mr. Mark Borkowski and my Division have _x000D_
been working very closely hand in hand, and we even co-fund a _x000D_
lot of technologies that I have just talked about in my opening _x000D_
remarks. These are undergoing operational assessment right now._x000D_
    So for the resource allocation plan cycle, which is for _x000D_
fiscal year 2017 to 2021, our two organizations sat down and _x000D_
tried to put in the budget on my side the technology cost to _x000D_
complete the development of technologies that we think would be _x000D_
ready for acquisition within that timeframe and delivered that _x000D_
in time. And OTIA's cost is the acquisition and maintenance of _x000D_
that. But we both do it because we know that it is the right _x000D_
thing to do, but I frankly doubt that the budget request that _x000D_
Mr. Borkowski put in will get approved just because of the way _x000D_
the budget is structured._x000D_
    Being an operational department, CBP has many urgent needs, _x000D_
and if OTIA comes up and asks for a budget for a possible _x000D_
technology that might or might not be successful 3 years from _x000D_
now, it does not come as a very strong argument against other _x000D_
very urgent needs._x000D_
    So the problem of what we call ``wedging the budget,'' if _x000D_
we do not do that, then, of course, there is no smooth _x000D_
transition. Even if I am successful, let us say, to deliver _x000D_
technology in fiscal year 2018, by that time, when we get to _x000D_
that point and we pass all the operational assessment, and let _x000D_
us say OBP asks Mark, yes, we want the technology, we want the _x000D_
technology, and if Mark does not have it in his plan, at that _x000D_
time then he would have to scrounge for money because we cannot _x000D_
wedge the budget. So that is the problem that does impact most _x000D_
of us who are trying to bring very innovative technology into _x000D_
acquisition."
2925691,2925690,2925692,19241,6,    I am.
2925692,2925691,2925693,19241,6,"    So I think two points, Senator, coming from _x000D_
GAO's work on border security and acquisitions more broadly._x000D_
    One is determining what the user needs are up front before _x000D_
moving forward with deploying technology, and it is important--_x000D_
and we have reported on this as it relates to the surveillance _x000D_
technologies in Arizona--for CBP to better document the _x000D_
underlying analysis and justification for what it is deploying, _x000D_
where it is deploying it, and in what quantities. So we think _x000D_
that is important._x000D_
    And then the second piece of that is to conduct robust _x000D_
testing of what is being deployed to ensure that you are _x000D_
identifying any risks as early on in the process as possible so _x000D_
that CBP is best positioned to be able to address those risks _x000D_
before moving toward full procurement and full deployment._x000D_
    So I think those are two key themes emerging from our work."
2925693,2925692,2925694,19241,6,"    Well, I should begin by saying that I am an _x000D_
attorney, not a policy analyst, so I would certainly defer to _x000D_
my co-panelists on that issue. And I would also be happy to put _x000D_
you in touch, if necessary, with any of the CRS border security _x000D_
experts._x000D_
    I could make an observation, though, and this is more in _x000D_
terms of the legislative role, and that is simply that a _x000D_
central issue for Congress has always been what is the _x000D_
appropriate level of discretion and what is the appropriate _x000D_
level of guidance that should be proffered to DHS through _x000D_
legislation. On issues of border security, sometimes Congress _x000D_
has been very specific; sometimes it has been very general. _x000D_
Sometimes it has re-evaluated things over times where it has _x000D_
provided a general authority and it later imposed a specific _x000D_
requirement; or other times it has had specific requirements _x000D_
that it has later deemed to be too onerous and provided a more _x000D_
general framework for DHS to operate with._x000D_
    So the two observations would be, No. 1, the appropriate _x000D_
level of discretion and guidance may be different in Congress' _x000D_
view depending on the particular issue related to border _x000D_
security. And, No. 2, it is not necessarily guaranteed that _x000D_
just because Congress believes at a particular moment a certain _x000D_
level of discretion should be given or a specific amount of _x000D_
guidance should be given that they cannot change it at a later _x000D_
date."
2925694,2925693,2925695,19241,6,    Senator Lankford.
2925695,2925694,2925696,19241,6,"    So you absolutely have to have the right mix, _x000D_
depending on the terrain, depending on the activity, the _x000D_
threats, et cetera. Right now I think our challenge is _x000D_
finishing what we started on the technology piece. I think that _x000D_
would do more for us. If you are just looking at the border _x000D_
environment, at the immediate border, the technology would be _x000D_
my priority, would be our priority for the agency."
2925696,2925695,2925697,19241,6,"    Yes, actually we sort of went the other way _x000D_
with the ground-based technology, because what we had was this _x000D_
very large, very expensive system, which was overkill for a lot _x000D_
of areas. So it made sense to us to have a multiple number of _x000D_
these technologies from small to large._x000D_
    The way that we are handling that is we are designing a _x000D_
strategy where we can centralize our workforce that does _x000D_
maintenance on those so that we can take advantage of the _x000D_
economy of scale of the workforce. That is a work in progress._x000D_
    It does continue, though, to be a concern. If we have _x000D_
multiple kinds of radars, multiple kinds of cameras, downstream _x000D_
we may want to make the cameras the same on different systems. _x000D_
But that will be a plan going forward."
2925697,2925696,2925698,19241,6,"    Well, we do not use Border Patrol agents to _x000D_
do the maintenance, first of all."
2925698,2925697,2925699,19241,6,"    Dollars, that is correct. And, by the way, I _x000D_
know this is counterintuitive, but the actual cost of _x000D_
sustaining the systems the way we are doing now has actually _x000D_
gone down because we are sustaining lower-cost systems. That _x000D_
does not mean we cannot drive efficiencies as we go forward and _x000D_
drive those costs even further down. But so far this has _x000D_
actually been a good trend._x000D_
    I think the way we would deal with more combination is in _x000D_
what we call ``technology refresh.'' As systems age in 3, 5, 7 _x000D_
years, what you replace those with, you would look for _x000D_
commonality. So that would be the timeline we would be talking _x000D_
about."
2925699,2925698,2925700,19241,6,"    So the fixed and mobile technology does _x000D_
really well on ground targets, people crossing the border afoot _x000D_
or vehicles. Assets brought by VADER on the UAS has been very _x000D_
good at that. I think our biggest challenge collectively with _x000D_
Air and Marine and Mark's shop trying to procure is this slow _x000D_
radar detection for small--what they call ``ultra-light _x000D_
aircraft.'' That has been a challenge for us. We have tried a _x000D_
couple of different systems, had some success, but not as far _x000D_
along as we would like to be._x000D_
    The other big challenge based on terrain and kind of _x000D_
conditions is tunnel detection."
2925700,2925699,2925701,19241,6,"    So we have a system that we have borrowed _x000D_
from DOD, and we have done some testing with and had some _x000D_
success with. But the terrain varies so much along the _x000D_
southwest border that it has been very difficult to find a box _x000D_
or a machine, if you will, that will give us the kind of _x000D_
fidelity that you would like to see, the kinds of things we get _x000D_
with aircraft or fixed towers, mobile scopes, et cetera."
2925701,2925700,2925702,19241,6,"    I think we have a great and very extensive _x000D_
and actually increasing relationship with DOD at all levels, _x000D_
from the Secretary level down to the colonel and lieutenant _x000D_
colonel running the program. I have an office that does that, _x000D_
Chief Vitiello has an office that does, and Ms. Duong has an _x000D_
office that does that. So we are very much plugged in with the _x000D_
technology they do. We have all kinds of programs to bring that _x000D_
into our environment and check it out and test it, and in some _x000D_
cases actually use it to support operations. Very extensive."
2925702,2925701,2925703,19241,6,"    Right, so the lower-altitude systems, the _x000D_
ones that we borrowed from DOD that they have used in Iraq and _x000D_
Afghanistan, those we call ``tactical aerostats'' that _x000D_
distinguish from TARS. We have five of them flying in Texas. _x000D_
They are relatively expensive. We are leasing them from DOD. _x000D_
But they have been extraordinarily effective there. So now we _x000D_
are in the process of deciding at that cost how often should we _x000D_
use them. That is where that is----"
2925703,2925702,2925704,19241,6,"    It is the operations and maintenance and _x000D_
sustainment of it. So we are basically leasing the DOD crews _x000D_
that operate those. We have been able to get DOD to transfer us _x000D_
four of the small ones as well as some towers. So we have _x000D_
gotten transfers of them. But right now we are leasing systems, _x000D_
and we are paying for the operations and support."
2925704,2925703,2925705,19241,6,"    So one of the suite of measures that we _x000D_
collect is called ``effectiveness,'' and effectiveness is _x000D_
designed to get at how many people crossed the border last _x000D_
night and how many of them were apprehended. And so the data _x000D_
that we collect, again, as Anh talked about--this is an _x000D_
estimate, but the data for last year shows that we are in the _x000D_
75-to 78-percent range on effectiveness across the southwest _x000D_
border."
2925705,2925704,2925706,19241,6,"    Individuals and indications of people who _x000D_
crossed, either through a camera observation, an aircraft, an _x000D_
individual agent, or what we call ``sign,'' footprints in the _x000D_
desert, if you will."
2925706,2925705,2925707,19241,6,"    You wrap those all up, and we try to do a 24-_x000D_
by-7 estimate of that activity across the southwest border. And _x000D_
then also that effectiveness ratio counts for the people who _x000D_
came in, the people who were apprehended, as well as the ones _x000D_
that ran back, what we call ``turnbacks.''"
2925707,2925706,2925708,19241,6,"    Thank you, Senator Lankford._x000D_
    Let me pick it up there, because that is, in terms of _x000D_
testimony before the Committee, there is a discrepancy there. _x000D_
Maybe that is the discrepancy. If you are looking at detections _x000D_
and measuring versus--how many people you detected versus how _x000D_
many you apprehended, it is 75 percent. But you are not _x000D_
detecting everybody, which is one of the reasons I asked the _x000D_
question about some level of understanding of what situational _x000D_
awareness is. So is there any sense of what percent you are not _x000D_
detecting?"
2925708,2925707,2925709,19241,6,"    At the departmental level, they are also _x000D_
attempting to look at the probability of apprehension, which _x000D_
would start to estimate the actual flow that will give you a _x000D_
scientific estimate, but still an estimate about the number of _x000D_
people who are crossing. When the technology and the deployment _x000D_
supports real-time information, you can be very confident in _x000D_
specific zones where there is enough agents and there is enough _x000D_
technology to show you what is happening in real time and _x000D_
record the responses in real time and the effect. So the _x000D_
effectiveness in those locations is very well documented. _x000D_
Again, not scientific because sometimes you do not see the _x000D_
people cross in real time. But you can use that camera data, _x000D_
you can use the agent data, and you can wrap those shift by _x000D_
shift, day by day, and you can start to look at trends across._x000D_
    In the places where we do not have that kind of deployment, _x000D_
we are using this change detection technology, for instance, _x000D_
something that hangs off of the UAS that can fly the border, _x000D_
take a digital snapshot, if you will, and then an interval _x000D_
later, maybe an hour, maybe a shift, maybe a day, and look at _x000D_
that land again, and you can start to recognize change based on _x000D_
the way the pixels look in the picture. And that can tell you _x000D_
and verify when you do not have threat or when you do not have _x000D_
crossings, and then it will give you a lead to find out if _x000D_
there is change in those specific areas to go and investigate _x000D_
what it is._x000D_
    So that has been very useful for us in these locations _x000D_
where we believe, based on the people who live there or based _x000D_
on our own activity levels, that there is not a lot of traffic, _x000D_
and we have been able to validate that, in fact, some of those _x000D_
locations do not see cross-border illicit traffic."
2925709,2925708,2925710,19241,6,"    And, again, I will definitely acknowledge _x000D_
this is very difficult to wrap your arms around in terms of _x000D_
what the data is, what the information is, what the truth is. _x000D_
But, we started this series of hearings on border security, and _x000D_
certainly DHS is pointing to the number of apprehensions being _x000D_
down, which is, a quasi-metric for how effective we are _x000D_
securing our border. At the same time, we started our first _x000D_
panel, people on the border themselves, and to a person, they _x000D_
were very emphatic making the point that the border is not _x000D_
secure. And another pretty interesting metric, I think _x000D_
depressing metric, when we had General McCaffrey here, in his _x000D_
testimony before us, he said they were only interdicting 5 to _x000D_
10 percent of illegal drugs. So, I mean, there is a pretty big _x000D_
discrepancy, 75-percent apprehension rate of people coming into _x000D_
this country illegally, only 5 to 10 percent interdiction rate _x000D_
of drugs. As I grapple with that--plus Border Patrol agents _x000D_
talking somewhere between, people on the ground, say we have a _x000D_
30 to 40 percent apprehension rate._x000D_
    So, again, I realize this is very difficult to grapple _x000D_
with, but I really take a look at that interdiction rate of _x000D_
drugs as pretty indicative of how really not secure our border _x000D_
is. Can you just comment on that in terms of how that all _x000D_
relates?"
2925710,2925709,2925711,19241,6,"    I think as we get better with these _x000D_
deployments, as we start to fill out the Arizona Technology _x000D_
Plan, as we start to move into the other locations--the next _x000D_
for us is South Texas--we will get better in all categories. We _x000D_
will get more effective at the immediate encounters on the _x000D_
border, and we will get more effective at the drug _x000D_
interdictions._x000D_
    Looking at the worldwide estimate of production, which is _x000D_
an estimate, and looking at our seizure data, yes, there is a _x000D_
wide discrepancy. But if it is out there and our agents get _x000D_
wind of it, if they can follow it and track it down and make an _x000D_
interdiction, they are going to do that. Same for Air and _x000D_
Marine, same for the State and locals. There is a lot of help _x000D_
out there."
2925711,2925710,2925712,19241,6,"    But do you dispute that estimate in the _x000D_
5-to 10-percent range? Do you think it is higher?"
2925712,2925711,2925713,19241,6,"    I cannot dispute it. I am not familiar with _x000D_
how they do worldwide production, the aggregate of all the _x000D_
drugs that are produced. I assume we are in a small percentage _x000D_
of interdictions that are actually made."
2925713,2925712,2925714,19241,6,"    The reason I really point that out is, _x000D_
again, as we really explore this problem--I am from a _x000D_
manufacturing background, and our Ranking Member always talks _x000D_
about root cause as well. If I were really to put a finger on _x000D_
the root cause of our insecure border, it is really our _x000D_
insatiable appetite for drugs, and the drug cartels that have _x000D_
spawned, the destruction of public institutions in Central _x000D_
America that that has been created, this is a huge problem. And _x000D_
the drug cartels aligning themselves with international _x000D_
criminal organizations, potentially aligning themselves with _x000D_
terrorists, this is an enormous problem, which is why we are _x000D_
spending so much time on it._x000D_
    Commissioner Alles, I really do owe you the ability to just _x000D_
respond to the Office of Inspector General's report on the _x000D_
drone program. I know when we were down there in McAllen, I _x000D_
think you were pretty emphatic that you did not agree with _x000D_
that. So I just want to give you the opportunity to give us _x000D_
your perspective on that Inspector General report."
2925714,2925713,2925715,19241,6,"    I think one of the biggest problems cited _x000D_
in the Inspector General's report really was just hours of _x000D_
operation and just the inability to get it up as often as _x000D_
possible to drive that cost per operational hour down. Can you _x000D_
speak to that at all?"
2925715,2925714,2925716,19241,6,"    So, Chief Vitiello, very quickly, _x000D_
because, again, this is detection, and then you are in charge _x000D_
of apprehension, so you speak a little bit to the UAS program _x000D_
and how useful that is going to be and what are the drawbacks, _x000D_
what are the advantages."
2925716,2925715,2925717,19241,6,"    So I take the general description about _x000D_
VADER. This is something that we had never tried before, and _x000D_
there were people projecting on to it something that we were _x000D_
not even sure it was capable of doing. It turned out to be a _x000D_
very useful system, and we now are on our way to procure more _x000D_
of them. And so we think it is going to be part of the future. _x000D_
It is obviously something that makes the UAS much more capable, _x000D_
already a robust system with the Executive Office for _x000D_
Immigration Review (EOIR), et cetera. But having the VADER and _x000D_
being able to see moving targets in real time is going to help _x000D_
us, and has. We have learned a lot with it in Tucson. We are _x000D_
starting to experiment, if you will, and use operational tests _x000D_
in South Texas, and we look forward to its success there as _x000D_
well."
2925717,2925716,2925718,19241,6,"    OK. Thank you. And, again, we saw a _x000D_
pretty amazing demonstration of that, too, when we were down _x000D_
there. Senator Carper."
2925718,2925717,2925719,19241,6,"    Obviously--and I will leave it to the Chief _x000D_
and General Alles to talk about the operational impact, but in _x000D_
the acquisition system there is also a huge impact. First of _x000D_
all, obviously we cannot buy as much. Oftentimes that means we _x000D_
cut back on contracts. For example, what that can mean is I _x000D_
have an arrangement with industry. The arrangement is an up to _x000D_
but not necessarily all the way up to, and you can imagine what _x000D_
industry does. They project based on that, and they take some _x000D_
chances on the early part of it. Well, if I then cut some of _x000D_
that downstream effort out, they do not get the return on _x000D_
investment. Now I have got a tough relationship with them._x000D_
    The other thing that happens is all the competitions become _x000D_
winner takes all. They get very down and dirty and nasty. They _x000D_
increase protests. It delays the process. That also has a huge _x000D_
effect. It also affects their ability and their interest in _x000D_
investing in what they call ``independent research and _x000D_
development,'' which is investment that we all need to provide _x000D_
for the future._x000D_
    And then going to Ms. Duong's point, it makes it all that _x000D_
much more difficult to do this long-term kind of wedge planning _x000D_
for the next system that allows us to have a smooth transition, _x000D_
including with industry, from the S&T arena into the _x000D_
acquisition arena."
2925719,2925718,2925720,19241,6,"    Senator, it remains to be seen where those _x000D_
cuts are. We are obviously very concerned. This gives us a _x000D_
chance--gives me a chance, anyway, to amend my answer about _x000D_
what not to do. One of the challenges we have in----"
2925720,2925719,2925721,19241,6,    I appreciate that.
2925721,2925720,2925722,19241,6,"    So one of the challenges we have in CBP is _x000D_
that, corporately, CBP as a component, we have over 70 percent _x000D_
of the budget is applied to salaries. That is people. That is _x000D_
people in the field, almost everybody that is employed in CBP, _x000D_
the 65,000-plus, they are front-line people, a big mission _x000D_
support group here and smaller numbers in each of the field _x000D_
locations. But within the Border Patrol specifically, an _x000D_
enormous amount of money provided by you all and the taxpayer, _x000D_
but 93 percent of it goes to salary. So it becomes very _x000D_
difficult to decide what things you need to make that workforce _x000D_
capable that you cannot do with specific levels of cuts. That _x000D_
is our challenge, 93 percent labor, 7 percent that do _x000D_
everything else we have to do, all the cars and all the radios _x000D_
and all the phones and all the equipment that agents need to be _x000D_
capable, and that becomes a very difficult challenge for us."
2925722,2925721,2925723,19241,6,"    With regard to the Arizona Technology Plan, _x000D_
when we did our report last year on that plan, we did assess _x000D_
the cost estimates that CBP had in place for the plan and some _x000D_
of the highest-cost programs under the plan and found that CBP _x000D_
could take some additional actions to ensure that those life-_x000D_
cycle cost estimates better meet best practices. A key area _x000D_
that we reported on what the need for CBP to verify and _x000D_
validate its cost estimates against independent estimates to _x000D_
make sure that those estimates would be fully reliable and _x000D_
credible, and we made recommendations to CBP in that area to _x000D_
ensure that their life-cycle cost estimates more fully meet _x000D_
best practices. And we understand that--and Mr. Borkowski may _x000D_
be able to speak to this more--they are in the process of _x000D_
updating the life-cycle cost estimates for some of the _x000D_
technology programs under the plan going forward."
2925723,2925722,2925724,19241,6,"    From the standpoint of technology that we in S&T _x000D_
are developing, we make sure that we do a good job at _x000D_
estimating the life-cycle costs before we submit that _x000D_
information to Mr. Borkowski, for example, for potential _x000D_
acquisition. And it is a process that we keep improving._x000D_
    As you know, before we start a project, we already consult _x000D_
with our operating component in estimating the return on _x000D_
investment, and when I say ``return on investment,'' it is on _x000D_
their investment, not my R&D investment. So we estimate that _x000D_
let us say if we pursue this particular technology, let us say _x000D_
we could find 10 more tunnels per year. Then what does that _x000D_
mean in terms--and we estimate throughout that it would cost X _x000D_
dollars to buy a new tunnel detection system that we are _x000D_
developing, then does that mean it would break even in 2 years, _x000D_
5 years, 10 years?_x000D_
    So first it is just an estimate, and as we move further _x000D_
into the development of the solution, then we try to come up _x000D_
with a better and better estimate. And in the end, when we get _x000D_
to operational assessment, that is when we try to come up with _x000D_
a much better return on investment estimate to help CBP make _x000D_
the decision. So it is not just about, oh, look what great _x000D_
things this capability could do for you, but if you were to buy _x000D_
one or three or five systems and we estimate it would help you _x000D_
find five or 10 more tunnels, just be conservative, per year, _x000D_
then what does that mean in terms of cost saving? So we try to _x000D_
do that from an S&T standpoint to help them make the right _x000D_
decision._x000D_
    The other part is about acquisition programs, and as you _x000D_
know, S&T does not--it is not in our responsibility to do _x000D_
acquisition. That is OTIA's responsibility. However, the _x000D_
Department does employ us as an adviser, and we try to make _x000D_
investments to help acquisition programs better understand the _x000D_
implication of the maintenance costs, the tail of anything. _x000D_
Just like you pointed out, Senator, a lot of times the _x000D_
acquisition cost is actually the lowest cost. It is the easiest _x000D_
one that everybody looks at._x000D_
    So S&T always says that we want to be able to spend _x000D_
millions in order to save billions or hundreds of millions. So _x000D_
it is always a goal that we strive to achieve, and the _x000D_
Department has become more and more--in recognition of our _x000D_
role, and I am glad to say that S&T has become a trusted _x000D_
adviser for the Department along that line."
2925724,2925723,2925725,19241,6,"    I have got a couple more questions _x000D_
myself, also."
2925725,2925724,2925726,19241,6,"    Chief Vitiello, I have got a couple _x000D_
questions. I do want to go over this Office of Inspector _x000D_
General report that just came out today about the lack of the _x000D_
Department collecting data on prosecutorial discretion in _x000D_
Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals. In the report it says _x000D_
that as of September 30, 2014, CBP's Office of Border Patrol _x000D_
reported it had released 650 DACA-eligible individuals. So you _x000D_
are keeping track of that? In what organized fashion are you _x000D_
tracking that?"
2925726,2925725,2925727,19241,6,"    So in CBP specifically and the Border Patrol, _x000D_
when we process someone who is encountered by an agent and then _x000D_
we refer them either to deportation proceedings or in the case _x000D_
of unaccompanied children (UAC) to the U.S. Department of _x000D_
Health and Human Service (HHS) system, and then all of the _x000D_
encounters that we make are documented in a system, the _x000D_
enforcement system, so if it is appropriate, fingerprints, _x000D_
biographical data, photos, et cetera."
2925727,2925726,2925728,19241,6,"    But if you are apprehending somebody _x000D_
illegally crossing the border, how could they qualify under _x000D_
DACA?"
2925728,2925727,2925729,19241,6,    They would not.
2925729,2925728,2925730,19241,6,    But you released 650 under that.
2925730,2925729,2925731,19241,6,"    I do not know that that is a CBP number. I _x000D_
have not seen the report. We have had very few encounters with _x000D_
DACA-eligible individuals in our context."
2925731,2925730,2925732,19241,6,"    Well, yes, I mean, according to this _x000D_
report, you have released 650, ICE released about 12,750. So, I _x000D_
mean, your percentage obviously is quite low, but I was just _x000D_
questioning why--how could anybody qualify under DACA coming _x000D_
into this country illegally?"
2925732,2925731,2925733,19241,6,"    So we do have environments that we operate in _x000D_
such as checkpoints or people that are at the border that have _x000D_
not crossed the border and they are encountered by our agents, _x000D_
and they have eligibility under the standard. Not everybody we _x000D_
come in contact with obviously has crossed the border."
2925733,2925732,2925734,19241,6,"    I believe the Department has basically _x000D_
agreed with the recommendations of the Office of Inspector _x000D_
General to collect more data. Have you already been contacted _x000D_
in terms of the kind of data they are looking for as it relates _x000D_
to prosecutorial discretion?"
2925734,2925733,2925735,19241,6,"    Specifically to that, I have not seen that. _x000D_
We are always looking for ways to identify where there are gaps _x000D_
in the system, and so the issue with the unaccompanied children _x000D_
last year, we struggled mightily with understanding how our _x000D_
data connected with the data that ICE keeps as it relates to _x000D_
the detention and then further on to removal proceedings within _x000D_
the Justice Department. That has been a struggle for us for a _x000D_
couple of years."
2925735,2925734,2925736,19241,6,"    So do you deal much with just the _x000D_
prioritization of who we are going to try and remove the aliens _x000D_
that pose a danger to national security, those that violated _x000D_
immigration control, aliens, fugitives, otherwise? I mean, is _x000D_
that something you deal with, or are you just basically--you _x000D_
apprehend them and somebody else deals with those criteria?"
2925736,2925735,2925737,19241,6,"    So all the agents--there is a training _x000D_
regimen for everyone to understand what the priorities are as _x000D_
it relates to the memorandum, but obviously most of the work _x000D_
that we do--of the over 190,000-some arrests or apprehensions _x000D_
that were made so far this year, those are all recent border _x000D_
entrants, so they fall well within the priorities for action."
2925737,2925736,2925738,19241,6,"    So those priorities really do not affect _x000D_
you as much as they obviously affect ICE or other----"
2925738,2925737,2925739,19241,6,    Correct.
2925739,2925738,2925740,19241,6,"    The Department of Justice or HHS. OK. You _x000D_
did mention Border Patrol agents, the numbers. I just want to _x000D_
get your assessment. I know the Texas Department of Public _x000D_
Safety engaged in Operation Strong Safety, and they surged a _x000D_
lot of manpower to the border. I just want to get your _x000D_
evaluation, how effective that was, because we have talked _x000D_
about technology, different detection systems, fencing, that _x000D_
type of thing. In the end, we need manpower. And so just give _x000D_
me your assessment of how Operation Strong Safety worked, and I _x000D_
believe it was in McAllen, Texas. Or was that all of the Texas _x000D_
border? Or where was that centered?"
2925740,2925739,2925741,19241,6,"    It is mostly South Texas. I have actually _x000D_
seen directly the deployments in the Rio Grande Valley. And _x000D_
obviously as an operator, I am going to tell you that more _x000D_
boots on the ground is always better. Is it the most efficient _x000D_
way and those kinds of things? That really would be for the _x000D_
State to tell you how effective their deployments have been. _x000D_
But I know that we have worked very closely with them, so most _x000D_
of our deployments, especially in South Texas, are near the _x000D_
river, and having the Department of Public Safety--they have _x000D_
some capabilities in rural enforcement and on the river, et _x000D_
cetera, but most of that deployment is related to hardtop, on _x000D_
the highways, and they have been an asset for us with regard to _x000D_
helping chase smugglers, et cetera."
2925741,2925740,2925742,19241,6,"    So Operation Strong Safety, is that _x000D_
continuing?"
2925742,2925741,2925743,19241,6,"    As far as I know, it is."
2925743,2925742,2925744,19241,6,"    Again, have you measured at all--I mean, _x000D_
do you have kind of a before and after?"
2925744,2925743,2925745,19241,6,"    I can look at all of the data that we have _x000D_
developed. I am not sure--obviously, locally we are aware of, _x000D_
their contributions directly. But, again, it is a situation _x000D_
where there are more boots on the ground, et cetera, in that _x000D_
particular location, and in their deployments they help us in _x000D_
the areas where we know traffic is going to eventually try to _x000D_
make it, if it has made it past us."
2925745,2925744,2925746,19241,6,"    We were down there, particularly the _x000D_
Sunday, the extra day I stayed down there. I mean, you see _x000D_
their presence. I would never try speeding around the Rio _x000D_
Grande Valley._x000D_
    I would really be interested in any kind of analysis your _x000D_
agency or your Department can do in terms of what was the _x000D_
apprehension rate, what was the detection rate prior to the _x000D_
Operation Strong Safety, and what is it now, because I think it _x000D_
is just a really good test case of additional manpower, and we _x000D_
can kind of measure how much we have increased the manpower _x000D_
because of that."
2925746,2925745,2925747,19241,6,"    Yes. So we have seen--obviously, the prior _x000D_
testimony that you mentioned, we have seen lower levels of _x000D_
activity across the southwest border. That does include where _x000D_
Strong Safety is deployed. What is their contribution? What is _x000D_
the contribution of the other assets that we have been able to _x000D_
procure and send to the agents for their use and that _x000D_
capability there? That is the part that we struggle with. That _x000D_
is what you hear about data. That is what you want us to do _x000D_
better at."
2925747,2925746,2925748,19241,6,"    Yes. So, again, please look at that, _x000D_
because we also found out with aerostats, for example, when we _x000D_
talked to the people where those things were deployed, it shut _x000D_
down illegal crossings, but they just went someplace else. So--_x000D_
go ahead."
2925748,2925747,2925749,19241,6,"    That is often the case. I mean, I think what _x000D_
I have heard from the agents on the ground that are the benefit _x000D_
of that capability, they went from not having, high-altitude _x000D_
persistent surveillance, situational awareness, if you will, to _x000D_
having, a very capable system. We are advantaged in the sense _x000D_
that we do not have to use agents to monitor those sensors and _x000D_
run those systems. That is a contract. The other side of that _x000D_
coin is it is very expensive to do."
2925749,2925748,2925750,19241,6,"    And the other side, too, is when the wind _x000D_
is blowing, they are down, and let us face it, I would cross _x000D_
when the wind is blowing."
2925750,2925749,2925751,19241,6,"    Correct. That is why, we are very in favor of _x000D_
the Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) deployments, the Refresh, and _x000D_
the additional Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS), the _x000D_
cameras and sensors on the fixed and the mobile technology. We _x000D_
know those capabilities work. We have got a long history with _x000D_
some of it. We know that that is part of the future, and you _x000D_
will not be subject to the vagaries of the weather."
2925751,2925750,2925752,19241,6,"    OK. Thank you. I was actually trying to _x000D_
be shorter, but I have got so many questions. Senator Carper."
2925752,2925751,2925753,19241,6,"    Yes, I think we have--this is the data _x000D_
question. This is refining the assets that are available and _x000D_
recognizing the life-cycle costs._x000D_
    As an operator, what we try to do is say this is the _x000D_
requirement, this is the problem we are trying to solve, and we _x000D_
leave it to the acquisition professionals to understand, what _x000D_
is out there, how much does it cost. And I think we have gotten _x000D_
really good at learning from the acquisition folks how to _x000D_
establish requirements and then recognizing that life cycle, _x000D_
what we call operations and maintenance (O&M), is crucial for _x000D_
us to understand before we make the final decisions on _x000D_
deployments."
2925753,2925752,2925754,19241,6,"    Senator, we have got some pretty good _x000D_
processes that have grown in the Department that put some _x000D_
discipline to check the affordability, which includes whether _x000D_
or not we can pay for O&M. But there is a continuing problem, _x000D_
and I will just be frank, that when I challenge people, they _x000D_
blame it on Congress. So let me tell you what that is."
2925754,2925753,2925755,19241,6,"    They do. I am not sure that is true, but I _x000D_
will tell you what they say. What happens, as we buy more _x000D_
technology, you would expect that the operation and maintenance _x000D_
costs would go up. So what our budget plan is, let us suppose I _x000D_
have $100 and I start with, $80 to buy it and $20 to operate _x000D_
it. Over time, as I spend that $80, after I have built all of _x000D_
my technology, maybe I am down to zero, and I have moved all of _x000D_
that money from buying to operating and maintaining. What _x000D_
happens is that the budget people do not look at that as a _x000D_
total of $100. They look at it as money to buy and money to _x000D_
operate. OK? They see the money to buy going down, and they _x000D_
say, ``That is great. We love you. You have saved money.'' That _x000D_
is not really true, but that is what they say. ``But we hate _x000D_
you for operation and maintenance because that has gone up, and _x000D_
you need to make it flat.''_x000D_
    That is the real problem that we tend to have with _x000D_
operation and maintenance, is getting people to understand that _x000D_
if you buy more stuff, you need to operate and maintain it. And _x000D_
we have to look at the totality of the budget, not the _x000D_
individual pieces."
2925755,2925754,2925756,19241,6,"    So describing the process, what we have tried _x000D_
to do with the capability gap analysis is going to the field, _x000D_
ask them what their challenges are, where they have specific _x000D_
things that they would like to solve with technology, with _x000D_
additional kinds of deployments, or other innovative ways to _x000D_
solve problems at the immediate border and, in specific zones, _x000D_
specific stations, specific sectors. And so what we have done _x000D_
is we have gone to the workforce. I explained to them what the _x000D_
process is, then gone out and taken surveys and gotten from the _x000D_
agents who walk the ground, who patrol the border, who are _x000D_
there, and gotten their ideas about what is required._x000D_
    Then what we try to do is we take that data, that _x000D_
information at the station level, roll it up to the sector, the _x000D_
20 sectors that are out there, then that will be fed up to us _x000D_
at the headquarters. Right now we are in a situation where the _x000D_
training is out for the bulk of the workforce, like 95, 98 _x000D_
percent of it. And then we have got about 70 percent of their _x000D_
ideas and their innovations about how to go forward with--_x000D_
specifically on the technology side. We have got about 70 _x000D_
percent of the data in._x000D_
    Once we get all of the data, we will have a baseline. We _x000D_
will start to have conversations both with OTIA and S&T to find _x000D_
out, is there technology available? Is technology the best _x000D_
available resource for solving the problem as stated? And then _x000D_
we will be able to iterate that process as we learned about new _x000D_
things that are coming onboard, what the future looks like, _x000D_
using the success we know we have with other things, and try to _x000D_
fit a program together that says, ``this is how many of these _x000D_
things that you need,'' and then you could go down specifically _x000D_
into the locations and say, for instance, the agents at Carrizo _x000D_
Springs need the brush cleared or they need additional RVSS. _x000D_
That is the kind of capability we look to have once the C-gap, _x000D_
the first iteration is in as we move forward."
2925756,2925755,2925757,19241,6,    I do not have any thoughts on that matter.
2925757,2925756,2925758,19241,6,"    I would just add on the unaccompanied alien _x000D_
children issue, which I think we have touched on a little bit _x000D_
today, GAO has a body of work looking at the unaccompanied _x000D_
alien children issues and have a couple of reports that will be _x000D_
issued this summer, including looking at U.S. programs in _x000D_
Central American countries to address some of those issues, as _x000D_
well as a report looking at screening, care, and custody for _x000D_
the children when they come to the United States."
2925758,2925757,2925759,19241,6,"    And so we will have some work on that this _x000D_
summer. That will help inform some of those points."
2925759,2925758,2925760,19241,6,"    Senator, I know the focus of this hearing is not _x000D_
about cargo----"
2925760,2925759,2925761,19241,6,"    I would just echo your comments as it relates _x000D_
to our partners in Canada. I think that relationship is a very _x000D_
good one. The local law enforcement and the Federal law _x000D_
enforcement as well as our partners in Canada, that makes a big _x000D_
difference. We are increasingly having those kinds of _x000D_
conversations in Mexico, and as we get smarter about how the _x000D_
Unity of Effort and the Joint Task Forces roll out, it will _x000D_
give us another opportunity to use the whole of government _x000D_
approach at the southwest border; and as our relationship with _x000D_
Mexico matures, it will be a benefit to all of us."
2925761,2925760,2925762,19241,6,"    Just I like the needle in the haystack. _x000D_
Technology attempts to make the needle glow, and if it deters, _x000D_
then it can reduce the haystack, so we agree with you. But we _x000D_
also agree with you that technology is not the only or not _x000D_
necessarily the best way to get there."
2925762,2925761,2925763,19241,6,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    One of the advantages of me not making long opening _x000D_
statements, I will make a closing one, because I have got a _x000D_
comment. If you want to reduce the haystack, what you should do _x000D_
is try and reduce, maybe even eliminate the incentives for _x000D_
illegal immigration. One chart we have been putting up here is _x000D_
a history of unaccompanied children coming from Central _x000D_
America, and prior to Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, we _x000D_
were somewhere around 3,000 to 4,000 per year. And then, we _x000D_
issued those memoranda in 2012, and that number jumped to _x000D_
10,000 the next year 20,000, the following year 51,000. I know _x000D_
it has come down a little bit, but it is still way above _x000D_
historic levels._x000D_
    So I think we have to, again, looking at the reality of the _x000D_
situation, what causes these things, and we need to reduce _x000D_
those incentives. That is why I have always been very _x000D_
supportive of a functioning guest worker program. 8.1 million _x000D_
of those individuals here in this country illegally are _x000D_
working. It is a rational decision. When you have wages that _x000D_
are so much lower in Central America and Mexico than they are _x000D_
here in the United States, it is a rational economic choice, _x000D_
particularly when the reality of the situation is, regardless _x000D_
of what the memorandum says, if you get into America, people _x000D_
are staying, particularly if you are a minor._x000D_
    So I think we really need to take a look at our policy, and _x000D_
I want to solve the problem. I think realistically we are _x000D_
probably not going to have comprehensive--we do not really do _x000D_
comprehensive very well, so what I have certainly asked the _x000D_
Secretary, what I hopefully asked my Ranking Member is work _x000D_
with me, let us identify those incentives, let us reduce them, _x000D_
and let us start approaching this in a step-by-step basis. I _x000D_
come from a manufacturing background. You do not solve problems _x000D_
just like that. I am perfectly willing to engage in continuous _x000D_
improvement. Let us take the step-by-step incremental _x000D_
improvements. Let us identify the things we can do. So if all _x000D_
of you would be willing to work with this Committee to identify _x000D_
those incentives, identify those steps, maybe a small piece of _x000D_
legislation--we reported one out of our Committee last week in _x000D_
a business meeting, just allowing CBP on Federal lands in _x000D_
Arizona. I would like to do it across the border. Probably some _x000D_
resistance there. So how about we just take a look at Arizona _x000D_
and see if that would actually work._x000D_
    So I really do hope that the Administration, the _x000D_
Department, your individual agencies will work with us. Let us _x000D_
identify those and, take a step-by-step approach and improve _x000D_
border security._x000D_
    With that, the hearing record will remain open for 15 _x000D_
days--I forgot to thank all you folks. Again, thank you very _x000D_
much for your thoughtful testimony, for sitting here and _x000D_
answering in a very thoughtful manner. We really do appreciate _x000D_
it. I know how much time and effort goes into this, so thank _x000D_
you very much._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 15 days until May _x000D_
28 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions for _x000D_
the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2925763,2925762,2925764,19241,8,"    Good morning. This hearing will come to _x000D_
order._x000D_
    I want to first welcome our witnesses. I appreciate your _x000D_
testimony, which I have thoroughly read and studied. The _x000D_
hearing is really called to take a look at a one-year lookback _x000D_
at the humanitarian crisis that we experienced last year as _x000D_
unaccompanied children (UAC) streamed across our border in _x000D_
record numbers. The flow has been reduced, but I would still _x000D_
say it is at almost humanitarian crisis levels, and rather than _x000D_
read an opening statement, I will ask for unanimous consent to _x000D_
enter my written statement in the record.\1\_x000D_

    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1241._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I would like to concentrate on a piece of Mr. Greenberg's _x000D_
testimony. I want to read a little bit of it, as soon as I find _x000D_
it._x000D_
    Mr. Greenberg in his written testimony says, ``In recent _x000D_
years, the number of unaccompanied children referred to the _x000D_
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS') Unaccompanied _x000D_
Children Program each year was generally in the range of 6,000 _x000D_
to 7,000 until fiscal year (FY) 2012. Those numbers increased _x000D_
from 2012 through 2014, from 13,625 in fiscal year 2012 to _x000D_
24,668 in fiscal year 2013 to 57,496 in fiscal year 2014.''_x000D_
    He goes on to say, ``As I will discuss later, the number _x000D_
has fallen considerably in the last year, though it is still _x000D_
high relative to caseloads prior to fiscal year 2012.''_x000D_
    Now, we have presented this chart\1\ a number of times that _x000D_
graphically depicts the dramatic increase in the unaccompanied _x000D_
children coming in primarily from Honduras, Guatemala, and El _x000D_
Salvador. And I do this from a standpoint of trying to lay out _x000D_
pictorially when did it all occur and what happened. And there _x000D_
is one dramatic event that occurred in 2012. It is called _x000D_
``Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA).'' It was _x000D_
implemented by this Administration, and I know there is an _x000D_
awful lot of state of denial from--saying, ``Oh, that did not _x000D_
really cause this; it is a push factor.'' There are multiple _x000D_
factors, there is no doubt about it. But I think it is really _x000D_
quite clear that that unilateral Executive Action on Deferred _x000D_
Action on Childhood Arrivals was the primary cause for this _x000D_
surge. And what I want this hearing today to talk about is the _x000D_
incentives we create in this country in our laws for people to _x000D_
come into this country illegally._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Johnson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1279._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    We are a nation of immigrants. We need to recognize the _x000D_
fact that people that come into this country by and large are _x000D_
coming for the exact same reason our ancestors came here: they _x000D_
are seeking the opportunity that this country offers people. We _x000D_
need to understand that and we need to, to a certain extent, _x000D_
respect that if it is done legally. We cannot tolerate an _x000D_
uncontrolled border, an unsecured border, and an immigration _x000D_
process that is out of control that is all based on illegal _x000D_
immigration._x000D_
    So we have to really take a look at our laws and take a _x000D_
look at those incentives for illegal immigration. Again, I _x000D_
would certainly look at Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals _x000D_
as one of those incentives that created this crisis. So that _x000D_
is, from my standpoint, what I want to glean from this hearing _x000D_
today in the testimony and the questions we will be asking._x000D_
    It is a serious issue. People's lives are put at risk _x000D_
because of these incentives, and we need to get to the bottom _x000D_
of this._x000D_
    The other point I want to make is the difficulty in getting _x000D_
the information to actually solve this problem. Part of the _x000D_
problem there is we have three different departments with five _x000D_
different component agencies dealing with this, and these _x000D_
children are passed from one department and agency to the _x000D_
other, and we do not keep a real flowing record, and each _x000D_
agency is charged with a certain responsibility in the process, _x000D_
and there is just no overall coordination of everybody's _x000D_
effort. And from my standpoint, I do not believe we are really _x000D_
truly enforcing the laws the way that they were meant to. And _x000D_
as a result, we continue to incentivize this kind of illegal _x000D_
immigration. That has got to stop._x000D_
    So, with that, I will turn it over to our Ranking Member, _x000D_
Senator Carper."
2925764,2925763,2925765,19241,8,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. As you are _x000D_
well aware, I am all into root cause analysis, and I will agree _x000D_
with you. If you take a look at what is causing our unsecured _x000D_
border, I would say the root cause is our insatiable demand for _x000D_
drugs. And in testimony before this Committee by General _x000D_
McCaffrey, if you really want a metric that shows you how _x000D_
unsecure our border truly is, it is how much of the drugs we _x000D_
are actually interdicting. It is about 5 to 10 percent, even _x000D_
though we are spending, with all the agencies spending, about _x000D_
$25 billion on a war on drugs._x000D_
    So, again, I agree with you. That is a root cause. But _x000D_
within that overall root cause of the overall problem, there _x000D_
are individual situations, and this is, the unaccompanied _x000D_
children coming in from Central America. I think there is a _x000D_
root cause there, and I think it is called ``Deferred Action on _x000D_
Childhood Arrivals.''_x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you will all rise and raise your right hand. _x000D_
Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?"
2925765,2925764,2925766,19241,8,    I do.
2925766,2925765,2925767,19241,8,    I do.
2925767,2925766,2925768,19241,8,    I do.
2925768,2925767,2925769,19241,8,    I do.
2925769,2925768,2925770,19241,8,"    Thank you. Our first witness will be Juan _x000D_
Osuna. Am I pronouncing that correctly?"
2925770,2925769,2925771,19241,8,    That is correct.
2925771,2925770,2925772,19241,8,"    Good. Mr. Osuna is the Director of the _x000D_
Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) at the U.S. _x000D_
Department of Justice (DOJ). Mr. Osuna served as an Associate _x000D_
Deputy Attorney General at the DOJ from June 2010 to December _x000D_
2010, where he worked on immigration policy and other issues. _x000D_
From May 2009 to June 2010, Mr. Osuna was the Deputy Assistant _x000D_
Attorney General in the Civil Division, Office of Immigration _x000D_
Litigation. Prior to these positions, he served as Chairman of _x000D_
the Board of Immigration Appeals. Mr. Osuna."
2925772,2925771,2925773,19241,8,"    Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Senator Carper, and _x000D_
Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to _x000D_
speak with you today about the mission of the Department's _x000D_
Executive Office for Immigration Review, our role in response _x000D_
to last year's border surge, and the work we continue to do _x000D_
with our Federal partners on this issue._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Osuna appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1245._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Our role in the removal process is to hear the cases of _x000D_
individuals charge with violating our immigration laws and _x000D_
deciding which of those individuals should be removed from the _x000D_
United States and which are eligible for some relief from _x000D_
removal._x000D_
    We carry out this mission through our corps of immigration _x000D_
judges in 58 immigration courts around the country and our _x000D_
appellate tribunal, the Board of Immigration Appeals. All our _x000D_
cases start when the Department of Homeland Security files a _x000D_
charging document with one of our immigration courts._x000D_
    Among the many challenges facing our courts, the largest is _x000D_
our growing pending caseload, which you referred to earlier, _x000D_
Senator Carper. There are more than 450,000 cases pending in _x000D_
immigration courts around the country, by far the most we have _x000D_
ever had. This backlog grew during recent budget cuts when the _x000D_
agency was unable to hire immigration judges and staff to _x000D_
replace those who left. In fact, while our immigration judge _x000D_
corps was shrinking, we continued to receive new cases, _x000D_
resulting in a continuously rising backlog._x000D_
    From last summer's surge alone, the courts received more _x000D_
than 80,000 cases between July 14, 2014, and June 30 of this _x000D_
year. We are taking steps to increase our capacity to _x000D_
adjudicate cases through a vigorous hiring effort, and hiring _x000D_
judges is our first priority. Overall, with the 18 immigration _x000D_
judges that we added a few weeks ago, there are now 247 _x000D_
immigration judges around the country, and dozens more are at _x000D_
various stages of the hiring process._x000D_
    Like our Federal partners, we took steps to respond to last _x000D_
year's border surge by adding new priorities to our existing _x000D_
priority, for all detained cases. Specifically, we added to our _x000D_
priority list unaccompanied children and those who arrived with _x000D_
children. We depend on our partners at DHS to identify these _x000D_
groups upon the filing of the charging document with the _x000D_
immigration court, and we are processing these cases as quickly _x000D_
as possible consistent with due process._x000D_
    As anticipated, when we identified these new priorities, _x000D_
the focus of our limited resources on these priority case _x000D_
groups has had a significant impact on the non-detained, non-_x000D_
priority cases awaiting adjudication. Thousands of these cases _x000D_
have to be rescheduled far into the future to make room for the _x000D_
higher priority cases. Overall, 45 percent of case completions _x000D_
in our immigration courts so far this year have been in _x000D_
priority categories, meaning individuals detained by ICE and _x000D_
those who crossed the border since last year._x000D_
    The numbers provide some insight into the work the _x000D_
immigration courts are doing. From July 18, 2014, when we _x000D_
started tracking our new priority case groups, to June 30 of _x000D_
this year, the immigration courts received approximately 35,000 _x000D_
cases for respondents DHS identified as unaccompanied children. _x000D_
It is important to note that many of these cases involving such _x000D_
children may not be currently pending before the court because _x000D_
the children are pursuing some sort of relief from removal, _x000D_
which requires work by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration _x000D_
Services, which you will hear from a little later, which has _x000D_
initial jurisdiction over these cases._x000D_
    The pending caseload for unaccompanied children is _x000D_
currently approximately 23,000. With a goal of holding an _x000D_
initial hearing for unaccompanied children within 21 days after _x000D_
receiving the case, I can report that more than 27,000 children _x000D_
have had an initial hearing scheduled by an immigration judge _x000D_
the date for which has passed, and immigration judges have _x000D_
issued more than 6,800 orders of removal._x000D_
    Under the law, orders of removal in absentia result from an _x000D_
individual's failure to appear for a scheduled and properly _x000D_
noticed hearing when ICE has established that the person is _x000D_
removable. With regard to unaccompanied child cases, _x000D_
immigration judges have issued orders of removal in absentia in _x000D_
about 5,900 cases._x000D_
    Children who appear in immigration court proceedings _x000D_
without an accompanying adult may require special care and _x000D_
modifications to normal courtroom procedures. We have in place _x000D_
guidance for adjudicating cases where the respondent is an _x000D_
unaccompanied child. Further, circumstances in a particular _x000D_
immigration court may require specialized dockets for _x000D_
children's cases. Following last summer's surge, all _x000D_
immigration courts are equipped to handle a juvenile docket, _x000D_
and 39 courts have current active juvenile dockets. Immigration _x000D_
judges also receive specialized training, most recently in _x000D_
April of this year, regarding juvenile cases._x000D_
    We recognize that the presence of a representative can _x000D_
increase immigration court efficiencies, especially with _x000D_
children. We have taken numerous steps to encourage pro bono _x000D_
counsel to provide representation, and we ensure that _x000D_
unrepresented children are aware of those resources when they _x000D_
appear before immigration judges._x000D_
    To assist in these endeavors, we operate a legal _x000D_
orientation program for child custodians under which custodians _x000D_
of unaccompanied children are provided with important _x000D_
information on pro bono resources, the immigration court _x000D_
process, and their roles and responsibilities. And a few months _x000D_
ago, we launched some representation programs that now operate _x000D_
in 24 immigration courts to provide direct representation to _x000D_
unaccompanied children._x000D_
    Last year's border surge posed significant challenges for _x000D_
all Federal agencies, including ours. We responded by taking _x000D_
steps to work toward hearing these priority cases as quickly as _x000D_
due process allows. These steps included making docket _x000D_
adjustments, reprioritizing certain cases, and refocusing our _x000D_
immigration court resources. We are in continuous and frequent _x000D_
contact with our Federal partners at DHS and HHS on how we can _x000D_
continue to improve our collective handling of these _x000D_
challenging cases._x000D_
    Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions you may _x000D_
have."

TESTIMONY OF MARK H. GREENBERG,\1\ ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY, _x000D_
 ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, U."
2925774,2925773,2925775,19241,8,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, _x000D_
Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify _x000D_
today. In my testimony, I will be describing the _x000D_
responsibilities of the Department of Health and Human Services _x000D_
in relation to unaccompanied children and will then talk about _x000D_
a set of key developments relating to those responsibilities _x000D_
since the Committee's hearing on this topic last summer._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Greenberg appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1252._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    When unaccompanied children are referred to us by the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security, we initially place them in one _x000D_
of a network of shelters while staff work to determine if they _x000D_
have an appropriate sponsor with whom they can live while they _x000D_
are awaiting their immigration proceedings._x000D_
    When they arrive at a shelter, children are provided with a _x000D_
complete medical examination within 48 hours. Trained staff at _x000D_
the shelters conduct screenings to determine if the child may _x000D_
be a victim of abuse or a crime or human trafficking. Children _x000D_
in care receive medical, dental, mental health services, _x000D_
education services, recreational opportunities, a legal rights _x000D_
presentation, and access to legal services, access to religious _x000D_
services, case management, and clinical counseling._x000D_
    While the children are in care at the shelters, we have a _x000D_
responsibility to place them in the least restrictive setting _x000D_
that is in the best interest of the child, taking into _x000D_
consideration the risk of harm to themselves or to the _x000D_
community or risk of flight._x000D_
    Initially, we seek to place children with a parent or a _x000D_
close relative or, if that is not possible, a more distant _x000D_
relative or a family friend. If we cannot identify an _x000D_
appropriate sponsor and the child does not get repatriated or _x000D_
attain immigration relief, the child will remain in HHS case _x000D_
until he or she turns 18, at which point we will remand the 18-_x000D_
year-old to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security._x000D_
    We seek to ensure that sponsorships are safe and _x000D_
appropriate. We require verification of the sponsor's identity _x000D_
and relationship to the child. The potential sponsor must _x000D_
undergo a background check and complete an assessment that _x000D_
identifies risk factors and other serious concerns. In a set of _x000D_
cases, caseworkers perform home studies as an additional safety _x000D_
measure._x000D_
    As part of the placement process, potential sponsors must _x000D_
agree that they will ensure that the child appears at court _x000D_
proceedings and must agree to inform the Department of Justice _x000D_
and Department of Homeland Security of any change of address. _x000D_
In addition, when we release the child to the sponsor, we _x000D_
provide the address information to the Department of Justice _x000D_
and the Department of Homeland Security._x000D_
    I now want to highlight some key developments since last _x000D_
year's hearings. As you noted, last year it was the highest _x000D_
number of children in the history of the Unaccompanied Children _x000D_
Program. This year, the numbers are down significantly, though _x000D_
still high in historic terms._x000D_
    Last year, we received over 57,000 referrals from the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security. In the first 8 months of this _x000D_
year, we have received fewer than 18,000._x000D_
    Last year, the President directed the Secretary of Homeland _x000D_
Security to establish an interagency group, the Unified _x000D_
Coordination Group (UCG), to ensure unity of effort across the _x000D_
administration. The UCG continues to operate. It has an ongoing _x000D_
role to facilitate requests from the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security or HHS, if needed, and this can include requests for _x000D_
additional capability, operational coordination, planning _x000D_
support, situational assessment, and critical transportation _x000D_
capabilities._x000D_
    Operating the Unaccompanied Children Program presents _x000D_
multiple challenges because of uncertainties about how many _x000D_
children will arrive and when. Incorporating lessons from last _x000D_
summer, we developed what we refer to as a ``bed capacity _x000D_
framework'' to ensure that we have enough year-round standard _x000D_
beds with the ability to quickly add temporary beds when there _x000D_
are seasonal fluctuations. This is a model that reduces funding _x000D_
during periods of low capacity while preserving the ability to _x000D_
respond to future increases._x000D_
    Since 2011, we have reduced the amount of time children _x000D_
stay in shelters from an average 72 days to a little more than _x000D_
30 days. We have maintained the average this year at 34 days._x000D_
    While we seek to ensure that all releases are safe and _x000D_
appropriate, we know that sometimes a child may develop _x000D_
concerns about his or her placement, and in April, we expanded _x000D_
our help line in order to receive calls from children who are _x000D_
in distressed circumstances._x000D_
    In addition, starting this month, HHS is beginning to offer _x000D_
post-release services to a child and sponsor in the first 6 _x000D_
months after release if a placement has been disrupted or is at _x000D_
risk of disruption._x000D_
    In December of last year, we published our interim final _x000D_

     OPERATIONS, ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS, U."
2925777,2925776,2925778,19241,8,"    Thank you, and good morning. Chairman Johnson, _x000D_
Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the Committee, thank you _x000D_
for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the _x000D_
role of ICE in addressing the ongoing challenges surrounding _x000D_
unaccompanied children arriving in the United States._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Miller appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1267._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I currently serve as the Assistant Director of Field _x000D_
Operations, for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, where I _x000D_
oversee, direct, and coordinate the operational activities _x000D_
throughout the Nation's 24 field offices and their sub-offices. _x000D_
This includes the transportation and removal of unaccompanied _x000D_
children to further agency goals and ensure compliance with _x000D_
agency policy._x000D_
    As you know, in 2014, there was an unprecedented influx of _x000D_
unaccompanied children from Central America to the United _x000D_
States. Through the whole of government, we continue to address _x000D_
this humanitarian border security issue in a manner that is _x000D_
comprehensive, coordinated, and humane._x000D_
    As part of the unified effort, ICE is responsible for _x000D_
quickly and safely transporting unaccompanied children from the _x000D_
custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to the _x000D_
custody of HHS and, if ordered, the removal of these children _x000D_
following the conclusion of immigration proceedings. Both of _x000D_
these functions are critical links in the overall process._x000D_
    While unaccompanied children are not housed in ICE's _x000D_
detention facilities, their short-term care and custody _x000D_
requires the use of agency resources and the time and attention _x000D_
of ICE's officers. During the time that ICE maintains physical _x000D_
custody of the unaccompanied children for transportation and _x000D_
pending their placement with HHS, such minors are separated _x000D_
from adult detainees. Unaccompanied children are provided with _x000D_
regular access to snacks, drinks, consular officials, _x000D_
telephones, and other resources._x000D_
    ICE transports unaccompanied children via ground, _x000D_
commercial air, and ICE charter flights. All 24 ICE field _x000D_
offices have primary and backup juvenile coordinators each of _x000D_
whom receive annual specialized training with respect to the _x000D_
unique vulnerabilities of children. These field office juvenile _x000D_
coordinators, a duty that I personally performed in 1999, serve _x000D_
as a local subject matter expert on proper processing, _x000D_
transportation, and placement of unaccompanied children. _x000D_
Additionally, they monitor operational practices for compliance _x000D_
with regulations, standards, and policy, and they are on call _x000D_
24 hours a day, 7 days a week._x000D_
    Currently, due to immigration court backlogs, immigration _x000D_
processes take months or even years. However, once removal _x000D_
proceedings have concluded and a final order of removal is _x000D_
issued, ICE takes appropriate enforcement action based on the _x000D_
Department's stated priorities._x000D_
    Accordingly, HHS can transfer custody of an unaccompanied _x000D_
child to Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and then ERO _x000D_
will remove the unaccompanied child in cooperation with HHS and _x000D_
the receiving government._x000D_
    We have taken a number of steps to prevent further surge _x000D_
this year._x000D_
    First, the President and Secretary have reiterated that _x000D_
recent arrivals and those attempting to cross the border are _x000D_
priorities for apprehension and removal._x000D_
    Second, ICE has implemented procedures for efficiently _x000D_
obtaining travel documents and transferring unaccompanied _x000D_
children through a streamlined process that allows our ERO _x000D_
officers to continue to perform their other responsibilities._x000D_
    Third, Secretary Johnson and Director Saldana have _x000D_
personally met with high-level officials in El Salvador, _x000D_
Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala to secure their cooperation in _x000D_
stemming the flow of their citizens into the United States. _x000D_
While the humanitarian influx is a seasonal challenge, early _x000D_
indications are that our efforts are paying off._x000D_
    While I am confident that we will not see a repeat of last _x000D_
year's unprecedented numbers, we are better prepared than ever _x000D_
before to deal with the arrival of unaccompanied children along _x000D_
the Southern Border. With the Committee's support, we continue _x000D_
to work closely with our sister agencies to address the care _x000D_
and processing of unaccompanied children arriving in the United _x000D_
States in a unified manner._x000D_
    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you _x000D_
today, and I welcome your questions."
2925778,2925777,2925779,19241,8,"    Thank you, Mr. Miller._x000D_

Services (USCIS), at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. _x000D_

    TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH E. LANGLOIS,\1\ ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, _x000D_
REFUGEE, ASYLUM, AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS DIRECTORATE, U."
2925779,2925778,2925780,19241,8,"    Mr. Chairman, Senator Carper, and other _x000D_
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the _x000D_
opportunity to testify at today's hearing on unaccompanied _x000D_
children. My name is Joseph Langlois, and I am the Associate _x000D_
Director of the Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations _x000D_
Directorate within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, _x000D_
at the Department of Homeland Security. I oversee the asylum _x000D_
program at USCIS, which plays a critical role in upholding our _x000D_
Nation's long tradition of providing protection for those who _x000D_
have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of _x000D_
persecution. My testimony today will focus on USCIS' role in _x000D_
adjudicating asylum applications filed by unaccompanied _x000D_
children._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Langlois appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1273._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of _x000D_
2008 (TVPRA) changed the track for unaccompanied children _x000D_
seeking asylum in removal proceedings and introduced a new role _x000D_
for USCIS. Prior to the TVPRA, only immigration judges had _x000D_
jurisdiction to adjudicate asylum applications filed by _x000D_
unaccompanied children in removal proceedings. Under the TVPRA, _x000D_
unaccompanied children in removal proceedings now have the _x000D_
ability to file their asylum applications with USCIS. This _x000D_
arrangement allows unaccompanied children to initially present _x000D_
their claims in a non-adversarial interview with a USCIS asylum _x000D_
officer rather than in adversarial proceedings before an _x000D_
immigration judge. While the forum in which the claim is _x000D_
initially heard is changed, the eligibility standard for asylum _x000D_
remains the same._x000D_
    In addition, if the asylum officer does not grant asylum, _x000D_
USCIS coordinates with ICE to transfer the case back to _x000D_
immigration court where unaccompanied children may renew their _x000D_
asylum claims in adversarial proceedings before an immigration _x000D_
judge._x000D_
    Since implementation of TVPRA in 2009, approximately 13,000 _x000D_
unaccompanied children have filed asylum applications after _x000D_
having been placed in removal proceedings. Since TVPRA became _x000D_
law 6 years ago, USCIS has granted asylum to approximately _x000D_
4,000 unaccompanied children. While the number of unaccompanied _x000D_
children being granted has been low compared to the number of _x000D_
arrivals and the number of applications, USCIS serves a vital _x000D_
role in protecting unaccompanied children who have been _x000D_
persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution by _x000D_
providing a non-adversarial forum to elicit their claims._x000D_
    The asylum application process generally begins when a _x000D_
minor who was determined to be an unaccompanied minor by CBP or _x000D_
ICE indicates an intention to apply for asylum while in removal _x000D_
proceedings. ICE then instructs the unaccompanied child to file _x000D_
the asylum application with USCIS. In the meantime, the _x000D_
immigration judge grants a continuance of the removal _x000D_
proceedings or administratively closes proceedings in order for _x000D_
the unaccompanied child to file the application with USCIS and _x000D_
for USCIS to adjudicate the asylum application._x000D_
    During the pendency of the asylum case, asylum officers _x000D_
communicate with ICE attorneys to provide progress reports on _x000D_
the case, verify the status of removal proceedings, confirm _x000D_
court hearing dates, and arrange for the transfer of files _x000D_
between ICE and USCIS._x000D_
    After USCIS receives the case, an asylum officer conducts _x000D_
an in-person, in-depth, non-adversarial interview of the _x000D_
unaccompanied child to fully explore the asylum claim. In _x000D_
addition, the asylum officer researches country conditions, _x000D_
completes a wide range of required biometric and biographic _x000D_
security checks. The asylum officer then determines whether the _x000D_
applicant is eligible for asylum and drafts a decision. Before _x000D_
any decision is finalized, a supervisor reviews the case to _x000D_
ensure that the decision is supported by the record and _x000D_
comports with the law._x000D_
    In conclusion, USCIS plays an important role in _x000D_
adjudicating asylum applications for the small portion of _x000D_
unaccompanied children who choose to apply. USCIS continues to _x000D_
monitor trends of new application filings and stands ready to _x000D_
meet any future challenges with a firm commitment to quality _x000D_
and integrity._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I would be more _x000D_
than happy to answer your questions. Thank you."
2925780,2925779,2925781,19241,8,"    Thank you, Mr. Langlois._x000D_
    Let me start with the chart.\1\ As I stated earlier, there _x000D_
are multiple causes for, obviously, children coming into this _x000D_
country, but does anybody want to take a look at that chart and _x000D_
basically dispute my overall conclusion of what the primary _x000D_
cause of the spike of unaccompanied children coming to this _x000D_
country was Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, the message _x000D_
that we are sending to Central America that if you get to _x000D_
America, you are pretty well home free? Does anybody want to _x000D_
volunteer a challenge to that conclusion?_x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Johnson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1279._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2925781,2925780,2925782,19241,9,"    First, I want to make clear that HHS is not _x000D_
an immigration agency, is not responsible for immigration _x000D_
policy, and our responsibilities are principally about _x000D_
providing shelter for the children and getting them to _x000D_
appropriate sponsors. The work on reasons for why children are _x000D_
coming is principally the work that has been done by the State _x000D_
Department and the Department of Homeland Security, and I would _x000D_
refer to the recent GAO report on this issue._x000D_
    The GAO report highlights the importance of crime and _x000D_
violence and economic conditions in the home countries."
2925782,2925781,2925783,19241,9,"    Let me just ask, has there been a _x000D_
dramatic increase in crime or a dramatic reduction in economic _x000D_
conditions in Central America starting in the year 2012 that _x000D_
would be kind of a trigger for that, be a catalyst for that _x000D_
type of enormous spike? I have the murder rates, homicide rates _x000D_
per 100,000, and quite honestly, in most of these countries, _x000D_
they have dropped in El Salvador in 2009, 71; 2010, 64; 2011, _x000D_
70; 2012, 43; 2013, 40. So, again, I realize Central America is _x000D_
not America, and, you have got a huge wage differential. These _x000D_
are certainly pull factors. But, again, I am looking at what _x000D_
caused that spike._x000D_
    I would say that nobody is really disputing that that is _x000D_
certainly a real possible cause right there. Let me get into _x000D_
some numbers here._x000D_
    Since 2009, from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, _x000D_
there have been over 100,000--109,000 unaccompanied children _x000D_
coming into this country. Of the children coming in 2009, we _x000D_
returned about 30 percent; in 2010, we returned about 22 _x000D_
percent; in 2011, we returned about 24 percent; in 2012, 12 _x000D_
percent; 2013, 6.2 percent; 2014, 2.7 percent; and as of 2015, _x000D_
about 3.8 percent._x000D_
    Now, again, we cannot really relate those returned versus _x000D_
when they came in, but that is just the returned versus the _x000D_
children coming into this country._x000D_
    So, in all, we have returned about 5.7 percent, about 6,248 _x000D_
unaccompanied children, when we have had 109,000 come to this _x000D_
country illegally._x000D_
    Now, is that sending a signal to people in Central America _x000D_
that as an unaccompanied child, if you come into America, you _x000D_
have a 94.3 percent chance of being able to stay? Is that a _x000D_
disincentive for making that trip or an incentive for making _x000D_
that trip? Anybody want to answer that? I would say it is an _x000D_
incentive._x000D_
    Mr. Miller, there are currently, I think in your testimony _x000D_
you said about 6,800 final orders of removal that have been _x000D_
issued. Those are adjudicated cases, people have been ordered _x000D_
to be removed; children have been ordered to be removed from _x000D_
this country. So far in fiscal year 2015 we have removed 569. _x000D_
Why aren't we removing the 6,800?"
2925783,2925782,2925784,19241,9,"    Well, Senator, first, the data I have shows _x000D_
that so far this fiscal year, as of mid-June, we had removed _x000D_
about 1,500 unaccompanied children."
2925784,2925783,2925785,19241,9,"    So 1,500 versus 6,800."
2925785,2925784,2925786,19241,9,"    Yes, sir. As a police manager, I have to look _x000D_
at all of the cases that we have to work, and I can tell you _x000D_
that if I am going to task my officers with going out after _x000D_
criminals that are at large in our community or going out after _x000D_
juveniles who are non-criminals in our community, I think it is _x000D_
good policing to go after the criminals. We face a very dynamic _x000D_
environment in a number of jurisdictions that are no longer _x000D_
honoring ICE detainers, and so rather than my officers being _x000D_
able to go and pick up criminals, convicted criminals in a _x000D_
jail, we have to go out with teams and find these people in the _x000D_
community. That is very resource-intensive, and if we have to _x000D_
prioritize those two populations, I think we are making _x000D_
appropriate prioritization, giving our policing _x000D_
responsibilities."
2925786,2925785,2925787,19241,9,"    Well, as long as we are talking about _x000D_
criminals, on Sunday we learned that 32-year-old Kathryn _x000D_
Steinle was killed in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who _x000D_
had seven prior felony convictions. According to ICE data _x000D_
provided to Senators Grassley and Flake, from fiscal year 2010 _x000D_
through fiscal year 2014, 121 criminal aliens were released and _x000D_
have been subsequently charged with a homicide-related offense. _x000D_
What do you have to say about that lack of enforcement?"
2925787,2925786,2925788,19241,9,"    I do not think that the two are necessarily--_x000D_
the larger data that we have been talking with your colleagues _x000D_
on the House side about, that represented a number of different _x000D_
reasons why those persons could no longer be detained. Many of _x000D_
those are a function of law. There are both criminal--I am _x000D_
sorry, circuit court decisions in the Ninth Circuit; there are _x000D_
also binding Supreme Court----"
2925788,2925787,2925789,19241,9,"    Tell me specifically what is preventing _x000D_
us, when we have people in this country illegally and they have _x000D_
had seven prior felony convictions, why aren't we able to _x000D_
deport those individuals?"
2925789,2925788,2925790,19241,9,"    In that particular case, our detainer was not _x000D_
honored."
2925790,2925789,2925791,19241,9,    Who did not honor it?
2925791,2925790,2925792,19241,9,"    San Francisco Sheriff's Department did not _x000D_
honor our detainer that we lodged."
2925792,2925791,2925793,19241,9,"    So you have no legal authority to detain _x000D_
that person yourself or apprehend them and deport them?"
2925793,2925792,2925794,19241,9,"    In that particular case, that gentleman has an _x000D_
outstanding felony narcotics warrant, and we feel strongly that _x000D_
the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) made the right decision in trying _x000D_
to resolve that criminal warrant before taking--we are allowed _x000D_
to take further civil action."
2925794,2925793,2925795,19241,9,    What is BOP?
2925795,2925794,2925796,19241,9,    Bureau of Prisons----
2925796,2925795,2925797,19241,9,"    Again, that did not make sense to me _x000D_
right there. So tell me what happened. You seem to know a fair _x000D_
amount about that case. What happened in that case where that _x000D_
individual had seven prior felony convictions and he had been _x000D_
released, repeatedly obviously, and now a young woman is dead? _x000D_
Why did that happen?"
2925797,2925796,2925798,19241,9,"    In that particular instance, he completed _x000D_
serving a Federal sentence for illegal re-entry after _x000D_
deportation by an aggravated felon. When he completed that _x000D_
sentence----"
2925798,2925797,2925799,19241,9,"    Let me start over. Why didn't ICE pick _x000D_
him up immediately upon that and deport him? What is preventing _x000D_
us from doing just that? We have got him in custody. He serves _x000D_
his sentence. Why isn't ICE right there at the prison door _x000D_
escorting that person back to his country of origin?"
2925799,2925798,2925800,19241,9,"    As I said, there was an outstanding narcotics _x000D_
warrant, felony narcotics warrant, and Bureau of Prisons, as we _x000D_
would have done the same thing, we would seek to resolve all _x000D_
criminal warrants before we go forward with removal. That has _x000D_
been our past practice for a number of years. We actually _x000D_
operate that within the criminal alien program. As a matter of _x000D_
agency direction, the officers are to resolve outstanding _x000D_
felony criminal warrants before proceeding with removal."
2925800,2925799,2925801,19241,9,"    So there was another criminal warrant, _x000D_
but he was released into general society to create a murder--or _x000D_
to commit a murder. I mean, does that make any sense to you? _x000D_
Because, I tell you, it does not make any sense to the American _x000D_
public. And that is the problem. That is what we are trying to _x000D_
grapple with here. That is the problem we need to solve. _x000D_
Senator Carper."
2925801,2925800,2925802,19241,9,    There was a State felony warrant for narcotics.
2925802,2925801,2925803,19241,9,"    And I think that the Secretary is taking very _x000D_
proactive steps through the Priority Enforcement Program to try _x000D_
to bring a number of locations that are not honoring _x000D_
immigration detainers. We have established requests for _x000D_
notification that look to overcome a lot of the concerns that _x000D_
our State and local partners had in working through Secure _x000D_
Communities, and by establishment and working through the _x000D_
Priority Enforcement Program, we hope to have communities like _x000D_
San Francisco come back and begin working with us proactively."
2925803,2925802,2925804,19241,9,"    I am not an attorney, Senator. I am a law _x000D_
enforcement officer, so I cannot really speak to the nuances of _x000D_
law or policy. I am told by our attorneys that there is limited _x000D_
ability to force communities to accept immigration detainers. _x000D_
Also, I think that has not been a historical police practice. _x000D_
Usually we work collaboratively to resolve outstanding criminal _x000D_
warrants and then to transfer custody when requests are made. I _x000D_
think some of the recent court decisions called into question _x000D_
ICE's ability to request that communities hold, sheriffs hold _x000D_
their inmates for 48 hours beyond the expiration of their _x000D_
sentence, and that is one of the reasons why Secretary Johnson _x000D_
in going forward with the Priority Enforcement Program has _x000D_
created a new paradigm where we will be communicating with _x000D_
these jurisdictions before the person is released from custody _x000D_
and being able to safely and effectively ensure their transfer _x000D_
of custody."
2925804,2925803,2925805,19241,9,    Very good.
2925805,2925804,2925806,19241,9,"    Senator, I think there are a number of reasons. _x000D_
I do think that the administration feels that a lot of the _x000D_
measures that we put in place last year, not only here _x000D_
domestically but also with our partners in Mexico and Central _x000D_
America, have had an effect. Certainly--and I would defer to my _x000D_
colleagues at the enforcement agencies here, but the _x000D_
administration does feel that that has been part of the reason _x000D_
why the numbers are down, is because of many of the----"
2925806,2925805,2925807,19241,9,"    I would just echo Mr. Osuna in that both _x000D_
Secretary Johnson and Director Saldana have met personally with _x000D_
a number of Central American officials. Coupled with the _x000D_
Department's outreach and coordination with the State _x000D_
Department, we are trying to overcome the message, the _x000D_
marketing by smuggling organizations last year that there were _x000D_
these unreal opportunities that were outside the law. And that _x000D_
seems to be taking hold. I think as Mr. Greenberg said, our _x000D_
colleagues from the State Department know a little bit more _x000D_
about this and the programs that are being operated. But it _x000D_
seems all indications are that our message is being well _x000D_
received, and our international partners are working in a high _x000D_
degree of collaboration to ensure that we do not have the same _x000D_
kind of humanitarian crisis that we did last year."
2925807,2925806,2925808,19241,9,"    Well, I think that----"
2925808,2925807,2925809,19241,9,    Yes.
2925809,2925808,2925810,19241,9,"    I think that cooperating with the nation _x000D_
states that are on the perimeters of these three countries to _x000D_
build their asylum adjudication process would assist us in this _x000D_
endeavor to have sanctuary provided by countries that are in _x000D_
the surrounding area. We have been working with Mexico for _x000D_
quite some time on their asylum system, so that would be one _x000D_
suggestion."
2925810,2925809,2925811,19241,9,"    Support the President's request for contingency _x000D_
funding. As we saw last year, there was an opportunity to work _x000D_
collaboratively. We are doing that very effectively. Mr. _x000D_
Greenberg and I have been traveling together to the Southern _x000D_
Border to make sure that our teams are aware of the need to _x000D_
work together. But it was very difficult last year. The _x000D_
Department had to reprogram hundreds of millions of dollars and _x000D_
take away from other functions to accomplish our mission. I _x000D_
think with contingency funding in our 2016 budget, we would _x000D_
have that flexibility to not only deal with unaccompanied _x000D_
children, but any other unforeseen crises on the border."
2925811,2925810,2925812,19241,9,"    I need to largely defer to my colleagues on _x000D_
this one. What I would highlight is that in ensuring the _x000D_
efficiency of the legal process for arriving unaccompanied _x000D_
children, the continued efforts to expand legal representation _x000D_
are essential."
2925812,2925811,2925813,19241,9,"    Support the President's request for fiscal year _x000D_
2016 for more funding for immigration court resources. That _x000D_
enables us to----"
2925813,2925812,2925814,19241,9,"    55 judge teams, which I thank you for----"
2925814,2925813,2925815,19241,9,    It is.
2925815,2925814,2925816,19241,9,"    Those resources are going to be critical for us _x000D_
to be able to have the capability to move these cases as _x000D_
quickly as we can."
2925816,2925815,2925817,19241,9,"    By the way, let me quickly point out, the _x000D_
message we are sending to children in Central America is 2.7 _x000D_
percent of them are returned from 2014. Even using Mr. Miller's _x000D_
updated numbers of 1,500, that is about 10 percent. So, in _x000D_
other words, the message we are sending is if you get to _x000D_
America, 90 percent or more of you will be able to stay. That _x000D_
is the message. From what my understanding is, Mexico is doing _x000D_
a far better job of policing its Southern Border, increasing _x000D_
their apprehensions by 79 percent. I think that is probably the _x000D_
No. 1 reason our numbers are down here, and that is a good _x000D_
thing. Senator Peters."
2925817,2925816,2925818,19241,9,"    Without objection, so ordered."
2925818,2925817,2925819,19241,9,"    In order to be eligible for asylum, an _x000D_
individual needs to establish that they have experienced past _x000D_
persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution on one _x000D_
of the five protected grounds. We call it race, religion, _x000D_
nationality, social group, and political opinion._x000D_
    Individual minors are coming forward, the vast majority--it _x000D_
is over 90 percent that appear in front of us--are represented _x000D_
by counsel. They appear in front of us, and we have small _x000D_
numbers. Our approval rate is approximately 40, 42 percent, but _x000D_
the majority are fleeing severe violence that is connected to _x000D_
at least one of the protected grounds. So that is the overall _x000D_
view of what is occurring here."
2925819,2925818,2925820,19241,9,"    Individuals who are deemed to be _x000D_
unaccompanied children by CBP or ICE are placed in removal _x000D_
proceedings in front of an immigration judge. When they are in _x000D_
front of the judge, they must request to apply for asylum when _x000D_
they are in front of the immigration judge in the adversarial _x000D_
hearing."
2925820,2925819,2925821,19241,9,"    The individuals that are in proceedings _x000D_
sometimes do have counsel; they sometimes do not. I am not _x000D_
familiar with how it occurs in front of an immigration judge."
2925821,2925820,2925822,19241,9,"    Senator, I can take that on. It can be _x000D_
challenging for our judges when they have children in front of _x000D_
them, as you can imagine, and you pointed out the scenario _x000D_
perfectly. A 10-year-old in front of a judge, sometimes it is a _x000D_
challenge for the judge to be able to find out exactly what the _x000D_
case is all about._x000D_
    Our judges take the necessary time to get to know what the _x000D_
child is all about, what the child's case is all about. _x000D_
Sometimes judges will have children come back a couple of times _x000D_
in order to get them comfortable, in order to hear what _x000D_
actually happened to them, and whether they wish to apply for _x000D_
asylum._x000D_
    The point of taking the time, the judge taking the time, is _x000D_
not just also to hear what the child's case is all about, but _x000D_
also to give the child a chance to find a lawyer. And there are _x000D_
a lot of organizations out there that are stepping up and _x000D_
providing lawyers for these kids._x000D_
    So for the most part, the process in immigration court is _x000D_
designed to get the child comfortable, to have the judge hear _x000D_
what the case is about, and to give the child a chance to find _x000D_
a lawyer or representative that can then assist them with the _x000D_
application for asylum, or for some other form of immigration _x000D_
relief."
2925822,2925821,2925823,19241,9,"    Not to my knowledge. I think we are--immigration _x000D_
court, because there is no right to appointed to counsel in _x000D_
immigration court, we have those situations. And when it comes _x000D_
to children, it is all the more striking, which is why we are _x000D_
trying to do what we can with our Federal partners to increase _x000D_
representation programs, to do friend-of-the-court models, _x000D_
things like that in a lot of our immigration courts to try to _x000D_
provide as much capacity not just for lawyers but also for _x000D_
responsible adults to step forward and assist the children that _x000D_
are coming before our judges."
2925823,2925822,2925824,19241,9,"    It absolutely can be very intimidating for _x000D_
obvious reasons, which is why we do what we can to try to give _x000D_
specialized training to our judges as to how to handle children _x000D_
coming before them. They are not like any adult case. They have _x000D_
to have specialized training, specialized procedures, _x000D_
specialized children's dockets, which I referred to earlier. _x000D_
And certainly the surge from last year provided that much of a _x000D_
bigger challenge because of the numbers."
2925824,2925823,2925825,19241,9,    Senator Baldwin.
2925825,2925824,2925826,19241,9,"    Thank you, Senator. While I was not present for _x000D_
those meetings, we were meeting with those officials to try to _x000D_
figure out an effective communications strategy to kind of _x000D_
overcome a lot of the marketing that smuggling organizations _x000D_
were doing to try to encourage children, thinking that they _x000D_
would be receiving some kind of immigration benefit that was _x000D_
not actually waiting for them on the other side, and it appears _x000D_
that those collaborative efforts are yielding results._x000D_
    And I would say that from my understanding of the _x000D_
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report--and the State _x000D_
Department has a very robust plan to continue that _x000D_
communication, and they have pointed to a number of indicators _x000D_
of economic difficulties, some of them stemming from _x000D_
agricultural problems, some of them tied to the lack of _x000D_
opportunities for these children. And I think that as we _x000D_
continue to work with our Central American partners and work _x000D_
collaboratively with the Department of State, we hopefully will _x000D_
be able to continue to address those in a unified U.S. _x000D_
Government manner."
2925826,2925825,2925827,19241,9,"    I would have fear that we would begin to _x000D_
backslide and lose some of the gains that we have experienced _x000D_
in the past year. And, we are trying to the best of our ability _x000D_
to mitigate a very dangerous journey for these children, and I _x000D_
think the more effective and the more that we can do through _x000D_
the State Department to meet their needs in their home country _x000D_
and work collaboratively with our foreign partners, we are _x000D_
going to mitigate or diminish the humanitarian crisis on our _x000D_
border, which, from my perspective as a law enforcement _x000D_
officer, is a good government function."
2925827,2925826,2925828,19241,9,"    The training to conduct interviews with _x000D_
children has been a longstanding training, I believe, with the _x000D_
asylum corps. I believe the first children's guidelines, for _x000D_
example, came out in 1995 or 1996. So we have had a history of _x000D_
interviewing children for asylum in the United States, and we _x000D_
have utilized a lesson plan to teach individuals the _x000D_
appropriate techniques. We have had a number of outside _x000D_
professors, consultants, and non governmental organizations _x000D_
(NGOs) assist us with the lesson plan. So it has been a long _x000D_
tradition._x000D_
    The numbers started to increase most recently, which _x000D_
emphasized, of course, the importance of the training, but we _x000D_
have been conducting this training I believe since about 1995, _x000D_
if my recollection is correct."
2925828,2925827,2925829,19241,9,"    Unaccompanied children, just like all asylum _x000D_
applicants, have to provide their own interpretation without _x000D_
government expense. We have an interpreter on the telephone _x000D_
that listens in to the interpreting to make sure that it is _x000D_
correct and fraud is not occurring. But the unaccompanied child _x000D_
needs to provide his or her own interpreter at no government _x000D_
expense, as well as an attorney at no government expense._x000D_
    Now, I did mention that over 90 percent of individual _x000D_
unaccompanied children are represented by the time they get to _x000D_
us, but that is coming from the courts, is where they start _x000D_
before coming to us, and 90 percent is the number that we are _x000D_
looking at. But it is no expense to the government, I believe."
2925829,2925828,2925830,19241,9,    Senator Ayotte.
2925830,2925829,2925831,19241,9,"    Senator, that is my understanding of the TVPRA _x000D_
as well. I know operationally the Border Patrol, when they _x000D_
encounter either a Mexican national or a Canadian national, _x000D_
they can work collaboratively through their local repatriation _x000D_
agreements to assure--for children who wish to withdraw their _x000D_
application and return voluntarily, they work collaboratively _x000D_
with those respective governments to ensure the safe return of _x000D_
those children._x000D_
    Now, to the Secretary's point that if we had that _x000D_
flexibility with other countries for those children who, at the _x000D_
time of encounter by CBP, whether it is Border Patrol or at the _x000D_
ports of entry, if they wish to withdraw their application and _x000D_
return to their country, we have outstanding repatriation _x000D_
agreements with those countries. We have many opportunities to _x000D_
effect that repatriation in a safe and humane manner. And given _x000D_
the opportunity, we would be able to exercise a broader _x000D_
spectrum ability for those children who are not seeking any _x000D_
kind of protection."
2925831,2925830,2925832,19241,9,"    Yes, ma'am. We support the Secretary's effort _x000D_
to have broad spectrum ability to do the best thing in the _x000D_
interest of the children that we encounter."
2925832,2925831,2925833,19241,9,"    Yes, ma'am. Our colleagues from CBP and their _x000D_
post-interdiction interviews, we are well aware that that was a _x000D_
marketing strategy of the smuggling organizations, and I think _x000D_
the Secretary worked extensively both, to educate and to inform _x000D_
that that was not the case, that there were not permisos, and _x000D_
that persons who were interdicted after January 1, 2014, _x000D_
throughout the immigration court proceedings, throughout the _x000D_
life cycle, as we call it, of the immigration process, they _x000D_
would retain that date of interdiction and, thus, remain a _x000D_
priority."
2925833,2925832,2925834,19241,9,"    To the best of my knowledge, from our _x000D_
colleagues in the State Department, that message has been _x000D_
received, and it seems to have contributed to the reduction in _x000D_
the influx this year."
2925834,2925833,2925835,19241,9,"    Thank you, Senator Ayotte._x000D_
    Mr. Miller, I am a little confused because earlier--you _x000D_
just said that according to those memoranda children coming _x000D_
here now, they do not have the benefits of Deferred Action on _x000D_
Childhood Arrivals. But you said--so they are a priority. But _x000D_
in your answer to my questions, you said that the priorities _x000D_
are really the criminals. So which is it? Are removals of _x000D_
children coming in here now a priority or not?"
2925835,2925834,2925836,19241,9,"    It is a priority, but most law enforcement _x000D_
agencies, they prioritize criminal actions or the apprehension _x000D_
and removal of criminals higher than the apprehension----"
2925836,2925835,2925837,19241,9,"    So it is not a top priority. Secretary _x000D_
Johnson in front of our budget hearing, on April 29, 2015, _x000D_
quote, he said, ``You have to show the population of Central _x000D_
America that you are sending people back.'' That was the _x000D_
Secretary of Homeland Security. OK, we have got to show Central _x000D_
America that you are sending people back._x000D_
    Mr. Miller, does it send the signal, are we showing people _x000D_
we are sending them back when we are sending, somewhere between _x000D_
2.7 and maybe as much as 10 percent back? And, again, let us _x000D_
really take a look at the number. From 2009, unaccompanied _x000D_
children, 109,000 have come into this country, according to _x000D_
some of my figures--and we are not exactly sure what the real _x000D_
number is, but that is pretty close--we have returned a little _x000D_
over 6,000, which is about a 5.7-percent rate. So, I mean, I _x000D_
agree with Senator Peters. Deferred Action on Childhood _x000D_
Arrivals does not legally apply to these children, but in _x000D_
reality, isn't that what really children in Central America are _x000D_
relying on, the fact that the reality of the situation is that _x000D_
if you get into America, you have got a very low percentage _x000D_
chance, very low probability of being returned? I mean, isn't _x000D_
that the reality?_x000D_
    Let me just ask you the question this way: Do you believe _x000D_
we are, as Secretary Johnson said, showing the population of _x000D_
Central America that we are sending people back in any _x000D_
meaningful way?"
2925837,2925836,2925838,19241,9,"    I think across the broad spectrum of all the _x000D_
persons interdicted on the border, yes, we are. We have worked _x000D_
very effectively with the adult population. We continue to make _x000D_
strides with the family units. And we will work collaboratively _x000D_
with our partners here at the table that, simply put, the _x000D_
juvenile process takes longer to mature. I do not have the data _x000D_
with me that shows the persons that have been removed, when _x000D_
they were interdicted, and when they entered into the court _x000D_
process. We see across the spectrum that by the time the case _x000D_
is mature, many of the people who have gone through this _x000D_
process and been adjudicated fully by the immigration court, _x000D_
they may have reached the age of majority before their case _x000D_
matures. That is not something that any one member is at fault _x000D_
for. That is something that is the nature of the process. These _x000D_
children, upon interdiction, have due process rights, and we _x000D_
have to wait for those rights to mature._x000D_
    I can tell you that, going forward, we will continue to _x000D_
utilize our efforts appropriately. I mean, I stand by my _x000D_
previous statement that it makes good sense as police manager, _x000D_
if I have limited resources and I am faced with the task of _x000D_
going after criminals or going after non-criminal children, I _x000D_
think it is the appropriate choice to go after the criminals _x000D_
first."
2925838,2925837,2925839,19241,9,"    Again, from my standpoint, I think we _x000D_
need to disincentivize children from making that dangerous _x000D_
journey. I think that is compassion._x000D_
    Mr. Greenberg, does HHS check the status, the immigration _x000D_
status, the legal status of sponsors of unaccompanied children _x000D_
that they turn unaccompanied children over to?"
2925839,2925838,2925840,19241,9,"    We do make inquiry of a potential sponsor as _x000D_
to their immigration status."
2925840,2925839,2925841,19241,9,    A hundred percent of the time?
2925841,2925840,2925842,19241,9,"    We make inquiry in all cases. In addition to _x000D_
that, for those cases that are subject to fingerprinting, we _x000D_
will get immigration information in the context of the _x000D_
fingerprint match."
2925842,2925841,2925843,19241,9,"    So if you find somebody who is in this _x000D_
country illegally, do you still turn those unaccompanied _x000D_
children over to an illegal immigrant parent?"
2925843,2925842,2925844,19241,9,"    In the process of placing a child with a _x000D_
sponsor, we inquire about immigration status."
2925844,2925843,2925845,19241,9,"    It is simply a yes-or-no answer. Do you _x000D_
turn unaccompanied children over to illegal immigrant parents?"
2925845,2925844,2925846,19241,9,"    We will place a child with an undocumented _x000D_
parent."
2925846,2925845,2925847,19241,9,    That you know is undocumented?
2925847,2925846,2925848,19241,9,"    That is correct, yes."
2925848,2925847,2925849,19241,9,"    Do you then notify either ICE or DHS _x000D_
about that fact?"
2925849,2925848,2925850,19241,9,"    We will provide the information about the _x000D_
location and the address of the sponsor at the time that we _x000D_
release the child."
2925850,2925849,2925851,19241,9,"    Do you notify any agency that that _x000D_
individual is in this country illegally?"
2925851,2925850,2925852,19241,9,    We will----
2925852,2925851,2925853,19241,9,"    Again, a very simple question. Do you _x000D_
inform DHS or ICE that you have just placed a child with _x000D_
somebody in this country illegally?"
2925853,2925852,2925854,19241,9,"    We will respond to any inquiry we receive--_x000D_
--"
2925854,2925853,2925855,19241,9,"    No, really. Just answer the question. Do _x000D_
you tell DHS or ICE that you have just placed a child with _x000D_
somebody that you know is in this country illegally? Yes or no: _x000D_
Do you tell them that?"
2925855,2925854,2925856,19241,9,    We do not affirmatively do so.
2925856,2925855,2925857,19241,9,"    That is a no, then. Can you say no? That _x000D_
is a no, you do not inform ICE or DHS."
2925857,2925856,2925858,19241,9,"    We will provide the information upon their _x000D_
request."
2925858,2925857,2925859,19241,9,    Do they ever ask you for it?
2925859,2925858,2925860,19241,9,"    In some circumstances, I understand that _x000D_
they do."
2925860,2925859,2925861,19241,9,"    Probably pretty rare._x000D_
    One question I have for you--and I am not judging whether _x000D_
this is right or wrong, but in your testimony, you do state _x000D_
that children have the privilege of representation but at no _x000D_
expense to the government. But then you are talking about we _x000D_
are doing requests for proposals on legal services. I mean, can _x000D_
you square that for me? If current law is that there can be no _x000D_
expense to the government and yet we are issuing grants for _x000D_
people to provide legal representation, just how does that--I _x000D_
mean, how do you get around the law? Which is basically what is _x000D_
happening, correct?"
2925861,2925860,2925862,19241,9,"    We are complying with the law, Senator, and _x000D_
we have a specific responsibility under the law to help _x000D_
children in receiving legal representation."
2925862,2925861,2925863,19241,9,"    So there is a conflict in the law, is _x000D_
what you are saying. So, on the one hand, there is a law that _x000D_
says there can be no government expense utilized to provide _x000D_
legal representation, but there is another part of the law that _x000D_
gives you the authority to have legal representation at _x000D_
government expense. Is that basically what is happening?"
2925863,2925862,2925864,19241,9,"    The law makes clear that we should be _x000D_
maximizing the use of pro bono resources, and we do seek to _x000D_
maximize the use of pro bono resources, but we need----"
2925864,2925863,2925865,19241,9,    But you are also----
2925865,2925864,2925866,19241,9,"    You are also granting money for legal--or _x000D_
certainly asking for requests and paying for legal _x000D_
representation, are you not?"
2925866,2925865,2925867,19241,9,"    That is correct, and we do have----"
2925867,2925866,2925868,19241,9,"    So, again, it is your testimony that says _x000D_
legal representation is supposed to be granted, but at no _x000D_
expense to the government, and yet you are paying for it."
2925868,2925867,2925869,19241,9,    We are following----
2925869,2925868,2925870,19241,9,"    Again, is that just, again, a conflict in _x000D_
the law?"
2925870,2925869,2925871,19241,9,"    We do not believe it is a conflict in the _x000D_
law. We are following the requirements of the TVPRA."
2925871,2925870,2925872,19241,9,"    OK. I tell you what. It sounds like a _x000D_
real conflict in the law that we ought to address."
2925872,2925871,2925873,19241,9,"    The law is clear that it says that we should _x000D_
be using pro bono to the maximum extent possible. That makes _x000D_
clear that if we are doing that, we should be doing additional _x000D_
things beyond that."
2925873,2925872,2925874,19241,9,"    Well, it looks like the law is clear in _x000D_
two different--in a conflicting manner: on the one hand, at no _x000D_
expense to the government, and then it is clear that we should _x000D_
be spending money. So, again, I think that is a conflict that _x000D_
we need to address._x000D_
    Mr. Osuna, real quick, what is the average time to _x000D_
adjudicate one of these claims? Do you have that stat at all? _x000D_
Are we talking months? Are we talking years?"
2925874,2925873,2925875,19241,9,    You are talking for----
2925875,2925874,2925876,19241,9,    For unaccompanied children.
2925876,2925875,2925877,19241,9,"    Our commitment, Senator, is to have the initial _x000D_
hearing in 21 days, and we are adhering to that timeline."
2925877,2925876,2925878,19241,9,"    OK. That is just the initial hearing. I _x000D_
am talking about adjudication to the----"
2925878,2925877,2925879,19241,9,"    I do not have that number because these cases, _x000D_
as my colleagues have mentioned, do take a long time. Some _x000D_
cases have resulted already in removal orders because the child _x000D_
probably did not have a claim to----"
2925879,2925878,2925880,19241,9,    But a very low percentage of those.
2925880,2925879,2925881,19241,9,"    6,800----"
2925881,2925880,2925882,19241,9,    A very low percentage.
2925882,2925881,2925883,19241,9,"    So they can take a significant amount of time. I _x000D_
will say that legal representation does help because, for _x000D_
obvious reasons, we----"
2925883,2925882,2925884,19241,9,"    You have got a lawyer making sure that _x000D_
the person shows up."
2925884,2925883,2925885,19241,9,"    Thus, fewer continuances and all that, so that _x000D_
does help in speeding up the court hearings, at least at the _x000D_
beginning of the process. But, yes, they can take a long time. _x000D_
I do not have a number to give you in terms of the latest surge _x000D_
of children, but it is certainly a matter of months and not _x000D_
weeks."
2925885,2925884,2925886,19241,9,    Isn't it really more a matter of years?
2925886,2925885,2925887,19241,9,"    Well, it depends. If the child does apply for _x000D_
some sort of relief from removal that requires a transfer to _x000D_
USCIS, then it can."
2925887,2925886,2925888,19241,9,"    Begging the indulgence of my Ranking _x000D_
Member here, Mr. Langlois is talking about a very low _x000D_
percentage of these UACs obtaining any kind of asylum, but yet _x000D_
we have a very low percentage of people with orders to remove. _x000D_
Again, I do not see how we can--this has got to be a very _x000D_
lengthy process then. I do not see--when you go back to 2009 _x000D_
and just see what a very low percentage of those people that _x000D_
have been returned and the very low percentage in total of the _x000D_
109,000, this has got to be a very lengthy process."
2925888,2925887,2925889,19241,9,"    It can be a lengthy process, and it is not just _x000D_
asylum, Mr. Chairman, but kids can also apply for special _x000D_
immigrant juvenile status, which is even more complicated _x000D_
because it involves the State court systems. I mean, that is _x000D_
the law that we have. That is the law that we work through. _x000D_
Again, I think that we certainly work through these cases as _x000D_
quickly as we can consistent with due process, and I know my _x000D_
colleagues do as well."
2925889,2925888,2925890,19241,9,"    I appreciate that. And, again, I _x000D_
appreciate you trying to comply with the laws, and I think that _x000D_
is what this Committee is trying to lay bare is the conflict _x000D_
within the law, the incentives we create for people coming to _x000D_
this country illegally. We need to address those conflicts and _x000D_
those incentives. Senator Carper."
2925890,2925889,2925891,19241,9,"    Two comments, Senator. First, the administration _x000D_
does, as you know, support the comprehensive immigration reform _x000D_
bill that the Senate passed a couple years ago. That rough _x000D_
framework I think is something that the administration and all _x000D_
the agencies here are behind. Specifically for my agency, that _x000D_
bill and other proposals have included significant resources _x000D_
and other additional tools for the immigration court system, _x000D_
and we would, of course, ask that any comprehensive immigration _x000D_
reform bill take into consideration the needs of the court _x000D_
system and the resource constraints."
2925891,2925890,2925892,19241,9,"    Given our role in the process, I defer to my _x000D_
colleague agencies on this question."
2925892,2925891,2925893,19241,9,"    Senator, I would say that in looking to fix the _x000D_
broken immigration system, we would favor things--the _x000D_
opportunity to balance the age of the conviction versus the _x000D_
statutory requirement that we have today that, regardless of _x000D_
the age of the conviction, many times our officers are _x000D_
compelled to take action, and as a result, frequently we _x000D_
exercise a great deal of resources on the initial encounter _x000D_
with the individual, only for that to be mitigated thereafter._x000D_
    I think if we put a temporal element to our enforcement _x000D_
prioritization in how individuals are charged under the _x000D_
Immigration Act, that would allow us to even better and more _x000D_
efficiently deploy our resources across the country."
2925893,2925892,2925894,19241,9,"    A very simple example would be a narcotics _x000D_
conviction from the 1980s. At times, frequently, when the _x000D_
person is seeking, for example, to have their green card _x000D_
renewed, it will be a referral to ICE for an enforcement action _x000D_
because the person has this narcotics conviction from the _x000D_
1980s. And as the statutory framework is today, we are asked to _x000D_
take the appropriate enforcement action, which would be to _x000D_
arrest and charge the person as an aggravated felon, _x000D_
notwithstanding any kind of--what the person has done since _x000D_
that initial conviction."
2925894,2925893,2925895,19241,9,"    As we discussed, individuals who are _x000D_
attempting to enter the United States unauthorized come for a _x000D_
variety of reasons. One reason, however, is that they are _x000D_
fleeing persecution. They have a well-founded fear of _x000D_
persecution or they have been persecuted in the past, and their _x000D_
claims should be heard. We should design the law to effectively _x000D_
and efficiently hear those claims._x000D_
    Senator, you had mentioned a needle in a haystack. To a _x000D_
great degree, that analogy rings true here where you are trying _x000D_
to get to that needle efficiently and effectively in order to _x000D_
grant asylum to individuals who deserve protection but _x000D_
effectively and efficiently deny those individuals that are not _x000D_
eligible and return those individuals._x000D_
    So to the extent that the law can grapple with that _x000D_
balance, that is what I would encourage, of course."
2925895,2925894,2925896,19241,9,"    That is correct, Senator. That was in my _x000D_
testimony."
2925896,2925895,2925897,19241,9,    Since 2009.
2925897,2925896,2925898,19241,9,"    Yes. Since 2009, I do not have that figure _x000D_
exactly in front of me."
2925898,2925897,2925899,19241,9,"    Actually, I can take it from right here. From _x000D_
2009, we are dealing with roughly 13,000 individuals have _x000D_
applied for asylum since 2009 via the court. So they were in _x000D_
front of an immigration judge; they requested to file for _x000D_
asylum. They were given a continuance, and then they have _x000D_
filed. So 13,000 as of the end of the second quarter."
2925899,2925898,2925900,19241,9,"    As we discussed, the process can take time, _x000D_
and there is----"
2925900,2925899,2925901,19241,9,    There was not enough coffee.
2925901,2925900,2925902,19241,9,"    Senator, there is no question, based on long _x000D_
experience from our immigration courts with these cases over _x000D_
many years, that having counsel at the start of the process, _x000D_
especially for a child, makes the process more efficient. _x000D_
Immigration judges have to grant fewer continuances. The legal _x000D_
issues are clearer. Immigration judges do not have to spend a _x000D_
lot of time trying to tease out what the case is all about._x000D_
    So in terms of efficiency, there is little doubt that _x000D_
counsel at the beginning of the process makes our court process _x000D_
much more efficient."
2925902,2925901,2925903,19241,9,    Absolutely.
2925903,2925902,2925904,19241,9,"    Certainly, and it even has an acronym. The _x000D_
Central American Minors (CAM)----"
2925904,2925903,2925905,19241,9,"    The Central American Minors Refugee and _x000D_
Parole Program, the ``CAM program,'' as we call it--was _x000D_
designed to give an alternative to individuals that are in _x000D_
these three countries a safe and legal alternative to taking _x000D_
the dangerous road to the United States with smugglers. The _x000D_
program allows individuals who are lawfully present in the _x000D_
United States to file for their children that remain in--_x000D_
unmarried children that remain in these three countries. They _x000D_
file. A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing is done to make _x000D_
sure that the relationship is valid. Then we have the State _x000D_
Department, who is the manager of the program, they arrange for _x000D_
the child to be preliminarily interviewed in the country. When _x000D_
the case is ripe to be presented as a refugee or for parole, a _x000D_
USCIS refugee officer will conduct the extensive interview. We _x000D_
will do background checks on the interview, fingerprints. We _x000D_
also do checks on the individual who is petitioning that is in _x000D_
the United States to make sure that they are in the status that _x000D_
they claim, also if there is any criminal record of that _x000D_
individual, and then we arrange through the refugee program, if _x000D_
they are deemed refugee, for them to come to the United States."
2925905,2925904,2925906,19241,9,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    I am going to use Senator Carper's fine example by allowing _x000D_
each of you to have the opportunity to make one final comment. _x000D_
But before I do that, I do want to requote Secretary Johnson _x000D_
before our budget hearing on April 29, 2015: ``You have to show _x000D_
the population of Central America that you are sending people _x000D_
back.''_x000D_
    To quote our Ranking Member, he frequently says, ``You have _x000D_
to find out what works and do more of that.'' Well, we have an _x000D_
example of what worked. In 2005, we were experiencing a real _x000D_
surge with Brazilian immigrants, 3 times higher than the _x000D_
previous year, 31,063. And as a result of that, in 2005, DHS _x000D_
Secretary Chertoff employed Operation Texas Hold 'Em where they _x000D_
prioritized existing space, dedicated bed space, and began _x000D_
detaining and removing all of the illegal Brazilians that were _x000D_
apprehended using expedited removals. By the following year, _x000D_
the number of people coming in illegally from Brazil dropped _x000D_
from 31,063 to 1,460._x000D_
    So, again, I think, what this hearing--and by the way, _x000D_
again, I just want to thank you all for your testimony. This _x000D_
has been very enlightening. A very complex problem, multiple _x000D_
root causes, I certainly have my opinion in terms of what the _x000D_
primary root cause is, but what we have found from your _x000D_
testimony and what we have found from your answers to questions _x000D_
is so much--and I think somebody here said it, broken _x000D_
immigration system. It is. That is a very valid acknowledgment. _x000D_
It is a broken system. It is convoluted. It is obviously within _x000D_
these three departments and five different agencies trying to _x000D_
grapple with this thing, it is not fully coordinated. Often _x000D_
there are conflicting laws._x000D_
    I am pleased to hear that our Ranking Member used the word _x000D_
``piecemeal'' reform. I realize this administration does not _x000D_
want to talk about that, but, listen, we do not do _x000D_
comprehensive very well, because it is complicated. These _x000D_
things are not easy to deal with. So certainly what I asked _x000D_
Secretary Jeh Johnson when he was before this Committee was _x000D_
work with this Committee, let us identify these problems, these _x000D_
conflicts, and let us--because, quite honestly, the reality of _x000D_
the situation is we are not going to do comprehensive reform, _x000D_
not in the next 18 months. Even by Secretary Johnson's _x000D_
admission, we are not even going to have situational awareness _x000D_
of the border in the next 18 months._x000D_
    So let us take a look at the problems. Let us take a look _x000D_
at the conflicts. Let us look at the convoluted process. Let us _x000D_
try and fully coordinate this. Let us start making the _x000D_
incremental improvements._x000D_
    I come from a manufacturing background of continuous _x000D_
improvement, root cause analysis. So let us look at the root _x000D_
causes of these individual little problems, and working with _x000D_
you, with your help, with your expertise--again, I truly _x000D_
appreciate your service, and I understand that you are dealing _x000D_
with the laws we have got. That is what we have to deal with. _x000D_
But I think the only thing that is realistic that we can _x000D_
accomplish, at least in the next 18 months, is a--and let us _x000D_
not use ``piecemeal'' because that may have the wrong _x000D_
connotation. How about a step-by-step continuous improvement _x000D_
process? I think we have that attitude. The Ranking Member is _x000D_
willing to work with me. Let us prioritize those individual _x000D_
problems that we can address and start fixing this on a step-_x000D_
by-step basis._x000D_
    With that, let us start with Mr. Osuna."
2925906,2925905,2925907,19241,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Carper. I would _x000D_
just say that the border surge from last year was really _x000D_
unprecedented. I have been doing this job for a long time, and _x000D_
I have never seen the level of interagency coordination and _x000D_
discussion that this engendered really from the start, from _x000D_
when we first started identifying this issue in late April, _x000D_
May._x000D_
    I think that it has been a challenge for all the agencies, _x000D_
but we have done the best we can. I think it has had an effect, _x000D_
and we look forward to continuing our discussion with you and _x000D_
with our fellow partners at the other agencies."
2925907,2925906,2925908,19241,9,"    Thank you. And I think I speak for the _x000D_
Ranking Member, too. When we went down to Rio Grande Valley and _x000D_
we talked to Customs and Border Protection, I think they did an _x000D_
extraordinary job grappling with a very difficult problem. And _x000D_
I think they kind of circumvented some rules, and God bless _x000D_
them for doing it. I mean, this is--again, we are a very _x000D_
compassionate society. This was a humanitarian crisis, and the _x000D_
people in those agencies I think rose to the challenge. So I _x000D_
think we really want to give them kudos for doing that. Mr. _x000D_
Greenberg."
2925908,2925907,2925909,19241,9,    An act of real bipartisanship here.
2925909,2925908,2925910,19241,9,"    Thank you, Senators. First, I want to _x000D_
underscore Juan's remarks about how closely the agencies are, _x000D_
in fact, collaborating and cooperating in these efforts. I _x000D_
first met Juan last year when we were both in Texas and _x000D_
visiting facilities at the same time. As Phil Miller indicated, _x000D_
he, his colleagues, and I went together again to Texas this _x000D_
year to look at both HHS and DHS facilities. Our staffs talk _x000D_
every day. We appreciate the importance of coordination and we _x000D_
are working hard to accomplish that._x000D_
    Chairman Johnson, I want to follow up on the issue around _x000D_
legal representation. My understanding is that the statutory _x000D_
language that you were referring to is language which is _x000D_
seeking to make clear that there is not a right to paid counsel _x000D_
at the expense of the government. We are clear that this is not _x000D_
about a right to paid counsel. I do not believe that there is _x000D_
an inconsistency in the language, but we would be happy to _x000D_
follow up with you and your staff and look at this more _x000D_
closely._x000D_
    And then, finally, I just want to indicate that, having _x000D_
been before the Committee a year ago, there has been tremendous _x000D_
progress over the course of this last year. We look forward to _x000D_
continuing to build on it, and we look forward to working with _x000D_
you in doing so."
2925910,2925909,2925911,19241,9,"    Thank you, Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Miller."
2925911,2925910,2925912,19241,9,"    Thank you, Senator. I echo what my colleagues _x000D_
expressed that never before has there been greater _x000D_
coordination. While these agencies and different departments _x000D_
have different statutory requirements, different fiscal _x000D_
constraints placed upon them, we work at an amazing level of _x000D_
collaboration and cooperation, making joint decisions, sharing _x000D_
information in a way that I think is really without precedent. _x000D_
And as a result of that, we continue to work collaboratively, _x000D_
not just on issues relating to unaccompanied children, but we _x000D_
continue to work collaboratively with immigration judges on how _x000D_
to better streamline these processes, to look at what can we do _x000D_
more efficiently to reduce the non-detained docket._x000D_
    One of our initiatives as part of Secretary Johnson's _x000D_
memoranda is to give opportunities to people who did not want _x000D_
to continue their non-detained court settings if they do not _x000D_
meet one of the Department's current priorities, making _x000D_
opportunities available where people can give us constructive _x000D_
feedback, and then we can share that information across the one _x000D_
government, all of the agencies and departments dealing with _x000D_
these issues._x000D_
    While there is a lot of work to be done--clearly, I think _x000D_
we are all in agreement with that--what we learned last summer _x000D_
is that we do not have to just sit there with our own agency _x000D_
and grapple with these struggles, grapple with these problems _x000D_
that we face every day, that by sharing information and coming _x000D_
to joint decisions, we can more effectively and efficiently _x000D_
work within the framework that we are given today and hopefully _x000D_
work with the Committee for a better framework tomorrow."
2925912,2925911,2925913,19241,9,"    OK. Thank you. Mr. Miller, we want to _x000D_
work with you. Mr. Langlois."
2925913,2925912,2925914,19241,9,"    Certainly the border surge last year _x000D_
presented a wide range of challenges for the asylum corps in _x000D_
its attempt to adjudicate the cases. We experienced an increase _x000D_
in our caseloads of credible fear, of reasonable fear, and, of _x000D_
course, unaccompanied children's claims in the affirmative _x000D_
context._x000D_
    Individuals that have suffered persecution deserve a just _x000D_
but very efficient adjudication of their claim. They deserve _x000D_
protection, and we must effectively give them that and _x000D_
efficiently give them that._x000D_
    We have cooperate at unprecedented levels with CBP as well _x000D_
as ICE, as well as EOIR, to assist us in that endeavor. I think _x000D_
that, as usual, all procedures or systems can be improved, and _x000D_
we work very hard in order to do that. I think we have got an _x000D_
incredibly committed asylum corps that is applying themselves _x000D_
diligently to this task and cooperating fully with our partners _x000D_
in this task."
2925914,2925913,2925915,19241,9,"    Well, thank you, Mr. Langlois._x000D_
    Again, I want to thank all the witnesses for your testimony _x000D_
and for your thoughtful answers to our questions. I will have _x000D_
more questions for the record. In particular, we have just got _x000D_
to get our arms around the information, the data, because you _x000D_
have to have that kind of data to really highlight where are _x000D_
the problem areas and what do you need to really address. So I _x000D_
want to work with all of your agencies to get that information._x000D_
    This hearing record will remain open for 15 days until July _x000D_
22 at 5 p.m. for the submission of statements and those _x000D_
additional questions for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2925915,2925914,2925916,19241,11,"    Good morning. This hearing will come to _x000D_
order. I guess we will start before Senator Carper arrives. He _x000D_
should be arriving shortly._x000D_
    I want to welcome the witnesses coming here this morning, _x000D_
taking the time, for your thoughtful testimony. I am looking _x000D_
forward to hearing it and giving Committee Members an _x000D_
opportunity to ask questions._x000D_
    This is our eighth hearing on basically the security of our _x000D_
border of the United States, a top priority of the Federal _x000D_
Government. Following this hearing, and prior to our August _x000D_
recess, our Committee is planning on issuing a report, an _x000D_
interim report, laying out all the components of our border, _x000D_
and the extent that we have it secure and the extent that we _x000D_
have not secured it. And I think our first hearing it was _x000D_
pretty clear by the testimony we received that our border is _x000D_
not secure._x000D_
    This hearing is going to be centered on our maritime _x000D_
borders, and to just kind of put things into perspective, a lot _x000D_
of our hearings have obviously concentrated on what is easily _x000D_
and readily acknowledged as our No. 1 problem, the southwest _x000D_
border, which is about 2,000 miles long. And in terms of the _x000D_
extent of the problem, we have had about 480,000 interdictions _x000D_
in fiscal year (FY) 2014. That number is down for various _x000D_
reasons, but 480,000 interdictions._x000D_
    Our Northern Border is more than twice that length, 5,225 _x000D_
miles long, and we had a little over 3,000 interdictions. And, _x000D_
of course, our maritime border is enormous in comparison, about _x000D_
95,000 miles, and we have had about 7,500 interdictions._x000D_
    So it is an enormous task. We are concerned, obviously, _x000D_
about drug smuggling, potential international terrorists, _x000D_
crime, those types of issues that the representatives that are _x000D_
testifying here today from the Coast Guard and from the Office _x000D_
of Air and Marine (OAM), which are components of the Homeland _x000D_
Security Department, as well as another individual from the _x000D_
Homeland Security Department will be here to discuss._x000D_
    So, again, this is from my standpoint an important hearing, _x000D_
kind of wraps up the different components that we wanted to _x000D_
explore in our eight-hearing series on the border._x000D_
    I do ask unanimous consent that my written statement be _x000D_
entered into the record, and Senator Carper is always so kind _x000D_
as to grant that or not object. And, without objection, so _x000D_
ordered._x000D_
    With that, I will turn it over to our Ranking Member, _x000D_
Senator Tom Carper."
2925916,2925915,2925917,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    I have been made aware that there will be one vote at _x000D_
10:30, so we will keep the hearing going and hopefully _x000D_
Committee Members can cooperate with each other in terms of _x000D_
sticking around to ask questions to keep the hearing going._x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you will all stand and raise your right hand. _x000D_
Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but _x000D_
the truth, so help you, God?"
2925917,2925916,2925918,19241,11,    I do.
2925918,2925917,2925919,19241,11,    I do.
2925919,2925918,2925920,19241,11,"    Please be seated._x000D_
    Our first witness is Rear Admiral Peter Brown. Admiral _x000D_
Brown is the Assistant Commandant for Response Policy for the _x000D_
U.S. Coast Guard. He has served multiple tours of duty at sea. _x000D_
He has also served as the Chief of Response for the Seventh _x000D_
Coast Guard District and Chief of Staff for Coast Guard _x000D_
Atlantic Area. Rear Admiral Brown oversees the development of _x000D_
strategic response doctrine and policy guidance for all Coast _x000D_
Guard forces. Admiral Brown._x000D_

    TESTIMONY OF REAR ADMIRAL PETER J. BROWN,\1\ ASSISTANT _x000D_
        COMMANDANT FOR RESPONSE POLICY, U."
2925920,2925919,2925921,19241,11,"    Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper, and other Members of the Committee. I am honored _x000D_
to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard's role in securing _x000D_
our Nation's borders. I thank you for your strong support of _x000D_
the Coast Guard and our men and women in uniform._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Rear Admiral Brown appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1446._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    It is also a pleasure to be here with two of our most _x000D_
important partners in maritime border security: Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement._x000D_
    The Coast Guard's success is due in no part to the _x000D_
partnerships that we have with these two organizations, and I _x000D_
would personally like to thank both Executive Director Edge and _x000D_
Assistant Commissioner Alles for their ongoing support and _x000D_
leadership._x000D_
    My complete statement has been provided to the Committee, _x000D_
and I would ask that it be entered into the record._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, maintaining border security while _x000D_
facilitating lawful travel and trade is a fundamental national _x000D_
security interest, requiring comprehensive, coordinated efforts _x000D_
across many departments and agencies and, in particular, the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As members of the _x000D_
Committee are aware, over 90 percent of global trade travels _x000D_
through maritime conveyances, making the safety and security of _x000D_
our maritime borders both an economic and national security _x000D_
imperative._x000D_
    The Coast Guard conducts operations every day to protect, _x000D_
prevent, and respond to a broad range of maritime border _x000D_
security threats, including illicit trafficking of narcotics _x000D_
and people by organized criminal networks, undocumented _x000D_
migration, the exploitation of our natural resources, potential _x000D_
terrorist activities, and the disruption of maritime commerce. _x000D_
So our strategy is to secure the borders in a layered defense, _x000D_
one that engages with foreign partners and takes action far _x000D_
from U.S. shores where threats to security and national _x000D_
sovereignty emanate. Our strategy focuses on exerting our _x000D_
unique authorities and capabilities in the maritime domain _x000D_
before those threats land in our ports, on our beaches, or at _x000D_
our borders._x000D_
    Overseas, the Coast Guard assesses foreign port security _x000D_
and the antiterrorism measures of international trading _x000D_
partners through the International Port Security Program. These _x000D_
activities aim to ensure that cargo bound for the United States _x000D_
meets all United States and international security standards. _x000D_
Additionally, in coordination with Customs and Border _x000D_
Protection, we receive and screen notices of arrival for both _x000D_
cargo and personnel long before commercial vessels arrive in _x000D_
the United States. We have liaison and attache officers posted _x000D_
at multiple embassies overseas and facilitate action across the _x000D_
full spectrum of maritime governance._x000D_
    Closer to shore, using our major cutters, maritime patrol _x000D_
aircraft, armed helicopters, and law enforcement detachments, _x000D_
we deploy assets to intercept those threats where they are most _x000D_
vulnerable: at sea. Along with our national security cutters, _x000D_
the Coast Guard's essential effort to recapitalize its fleet _x000D_
through the Offshore Patrol Cutter Acquisition Project will _x000D_
ensure that the Coast Guard is capable of projecting vital law _x000D_
enforcement presence on the high seas, in the 200-mile U.S. _x000D_
Exclusive Economic Zone, in our customs waters, and in our _x000D_
territorial seas for decades to come._x000D_
    The Coast Guard is the only U.S. Government component that _x000D_
has at all times both defense and law enforcement authority and _x000D_
is able to make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, _x000D_
seizures, and arrests for violation of U.S. laws both on the _x000D_
high seas and in U.S. waters. By maintaining that overt _x000D_
presence offshore and in the littoral region, the Coast Guard _x000D_
has interdicted more than 2,600 undocumented migrants this year _x000D_
alone and deterred many more from taking to the sea in _x000D_
dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels._x000D_
    Likewise, just this past June, the Coast Guard conducted 22 _x000D_
maritime interdictions, supported by CBP and others, that _x000D_
resulted in the detention of more than 60 suspects and removed _x000D_
more than 14 metric tons of pure uncut cocaine. In one case, _x000D_
our new national security cutter Stratton, using onboard _x000D_
sensors and law enforcement intelligence gained from other _x000D_
interdictions, located and seized a semi-submersible vessel _x000D_
with 2.8 metric tons of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean. This _x000D_
product was ultimately destined for the United States and would _x000D_
have left a trail of corruption, instability, and death as it _x000D_
moved through Central America and Mexico._x000D_
    Through a single month of interdictions, the Coast Guard _x000D_
denied criminal networks more than $480 million in wholesale _x000D_
drug proceeds and profits. Cases such as these that result in _x000D_
the detection and prosecution of traffickers generate _x000D_
additional actionable intelligence and fuel our cycle of _x000D_
success. Over the last decade, law enforcement intelligence _x000D_
gained from Coast Guard interdictions contributed to the arrest _x000D_
and extradition of nearly 75 percent of all drug kingpins who _x000D_
were extradited to the United States._x000D_
    Successfully patrolling and enforcing the maritime border _x000D_
requires a strategic outlook, tactical execution, and _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security unity of effort. Along the _x000D_
Southern Border, the Coast Guard operates within a new DHS _x000D_
Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. The three task _x000D_
forces set up under the Campaign Plan--Joint Task Forces East, _x000D_
West, and Investigations--operate cooperatively to maintain _x000D_
effective border security, and Coast Guard Vice Admiral Dean _x000D_
Lee is the Director for the Joint Task Force East._x000D_
    In addition, the Commandant, Admiral Zukunft, has signed _x000D_
the Coast Guard Western Hemisphere Strategy that outlines three _x000D_
priorities: combating networks, securing borders, and _x000D_
safeguarding commerce._x000D_
    Thank you, sir."
2925921,2925920,2925922,19241,11,"    Thank you, Admiral._x000D_
    Our next witness is Randolph D. Alles--``Tex,'' I guess you _x000D_
call him? I like that name. Mr. Alles is the Assistant _x000D_
Commissioner for the Office of Air and Marine with the U.S. _x000D_
Customs and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security. Office of Air and Marine is the world's largest _x000D_
aviation maritime law enforcement organization. Before joining _x000D_
OAM, Mr. Alles served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 35 years, _x000D_
retiring in 2011 as a Major General. Mr. Alles._x000D_

 OFFICE OF AIR AND MARINE, U."
2925922,2925921,2925923,19241,11,"    Thank you, Mr. Alles._x000D_
    Our final witness is Mr. Peter Edge. Mr. Edge is the _x000D_
Executive Associate Director of Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations (HSI), for the U.S. Immigration and Customs _x000D_
Enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security. Prior to _x000D_
this position, Mr. Edge served as Deputy Executive Associate _x000D_
Director and before that as the Special Agent in Charge in the _x000D_
HSI Newark office. He has also served as Director of the Office _x000D_
of Congressional Relations at ICE headquarters and as Acting _x000D_
Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the New York HSI office. Mr. _x000D_
Edge._x000D_

HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS, U."
2925923,2925922,2925924,19241,11,"    Thank you very much, Chairman Johnson and Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper and distinguished Members. It is a great _x000D_
opportunity to be here today, and I would like to discuss ICE's _x000D_
efforts to improve security along the maritime border of the _x000D_
United States. As you know, we work closely with CBP and the _x000D_
Coast Guard to target Transnational Criminal Organizations _x000D_
(TCO). Today, I will highlight our enforcement activities, _x000D_
operational challenges, and successes in the maritime _x000D_
environment._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Edge appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1462._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As interdiction efforts along the U.S.-Mexico land border _x000D_
increase, drug and human smuggling organizations have expanded _x000D_
their operations to include maritime routes where they attempt _x000D_
to evade detection by concealing contraband in sea freight, as _x000D_
well as in commercial fishing vessels. As a result of increased _x000D_
Coast Guard and CBP patrols, smuggling organizations are _x000D_
utilizing wooden fishing panga boats to travel further out to _x000D_
sea and up the California coast, to circumvent interdiction _x000D_
efforts._x000D_
    As a part of our ongoing efforts to identify, disrupt, and _x000D_
dismantle transnational criminal organizations, in 2005 we _x000D_
created the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST). This _x000D_
initiative promotes cooperation and coordination with Federal, _x000D_
State, local, tribal, and international law enforcement _x000D_
authorities. Currently, we operate 37 BEST units across 16 _x000D_
States and Puerto Rico, 19 of which maintain maritime units._x000D_
    The individual BESTs, located in maritime environments, _x000D_
face unique challenges along the shoreline because of the _x000D_
surrounding geography. For instance, since its establishment _x000D_
this past April, our newest BEST in Houma, Louisiana, has _x000D_
afforded us the opportunity to be more robustly engaged in the _x000D_
drug-trafficking organizations who are exploiting emerging _x000D_
Caribbean ports for maritime smuggling along the Gulf Coast. _x000D_
This smuggling is done via containerized cargo, commercial _x000D_
vessels, crew members smuggling drugs, and non-commercial _x000D_
fishing and sailing vessels._x000D_
    A notable success from the Newark BEST involves our _x000D_
creation of a carjacking task force in response to the dramatic _x000D_
increase in luxury vehicles being violently carjacked in New _x000D_
Jersey. These vehicles are then smuggled in containers from the _x000D_
Ports of Newark and Elizabeth to West African countries, and _x000D_
they are used there to fund illicit transnational criminal _x000D_
activity. The BEST investigations resulted in 29 arrests and _x000D_
the recovery of approximately 180 stolen vehicles worth more _x000D_
than $10 million._x000D_
    Along the Gulf Coast, the Houston BEST focuses on maritime _x000D_
threats from Central and South America through its Mexico _x000D_
Corridor Initiative. This initiative leverages law enforcement _x000D_
and the Department of Defense (DOD) resources. The BEST tracked _x000D_
a commercial freighter vessel from the Dominican Republic that _x000D_
traveled to Puerto Rico via Venezuela. To interdict this _x000D_
vessel, the Houston BEST worked with our office in Puerto Rico _x000D_
and with CBP's Office of Air and Marine to yield several _x000D_
arrests and seize nearly 2,800 kilograms of cocaine. The Coast _x000D_
Guard made an additional 11 arrests, and the freighter was _x000D_
seized by the U.S. Government._x000D_
    In San Diego, the BEST has been successful in combating _x000D_
criminal organizations smuggling drugs and people from Mexico _x000D_
into the United States along the coastline of Southern _x000D_
California. The BEST is part of the Southwest Border High _x000D_
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and leads a complex _x000D_
investigation targeting a large-scale maritime smuggling _x000D_
organization operating out of Baja California. Since its _x000D_
initiation in 2012, the investigation has resulted in _x000D_
significant enforcement outcomes across judicial districts. _x000D_
During the last fiscal year, the operation yielded over 30 _x000D_
interdictions and 95 arrests, as well as the seizure of 81,000 _x000D_
pounds of marijuana and 30 pounds of methamphetamine._x000D_
    A high-impact example of our maritime efforts outside of _x000D_
the BEST program is the Joint Operation Panama Express. This is _x000D_
a U.S. interagency strike force with significant HSI _x000D_
participation that identifies and interdicts multi-ton _x000D_
quantities of cocaine transported in the international maritime _x000D_
environments from South America through Central America and the _x000D_
Caribbean on to the United States. We play a critical role in _x000D_
Panama Express through our investigative authorities and our _x000D_
ability to leverage interagency resources._x000D_
    Along with the successes that we are achieving in the _x000D_
BESTs, we have also been designated as the executive agent for _x000D_
the Joint Task Force for Investigations that you heard about _x000D_
from my colleagues, and hopefully, we will be able to discuss _x000D_
more of that today._x000D_
    These investigative operations in the maritime environments _x000D_
are compelling examples of how the agency and the Department _x000D_
applies a ``whole of Government'' approach to targeting _x000D_
criminal organizations and preventing them from perpetuating _x000D_
their adverse impacts on U.S. border security. We remain _x000D_
dedicated to this cause and this mission, and we look forward _x000D_
to working with the Committee to effect some positive change in _x000D_
this area. We appreciate your support and the opportunity to be _x000D_
here today._x000D_
    Thank you."
2925924,2925923,2925925,19241,11,"    Thank you, Mr. Edge. I will start the _x000D_
questioning I think with you. You mentioned transnational _x000D_
criminal organizations. I would like to get some sense of the _x000D_
percentage of your attention or the percentage of the activity _x000D_
devoted to the different types of crimes--in other words, drug _x000D_
smuggling, human trafficking, potential terrorist activity, the _x000D_
combination of the drug cartels with trans-criminal _x000D_
organizations, with potential Islamic terror groups like _x000D_
Hezbollah._x000D_
    Can you give this Committee some sense of the proportion of _x000D_
the threats and the proportion of your time and efforts trying _x000D_
to combat those various components?"
2925925,2925924,2925926,19241,11,"    Certainly, Mr. Chairman. First and foremost, our _x000D_
investigative efforts are, again, based on our foundation as a _x000D_
border security agency. So we start there, and we enforce a _x000D_
multitude of violations that affect our Nation's national _x000D_
security. So, for drug smuggling, of course, drugs have, _x000D_
traditionally, always come across our Nation's borders, and _x000D_
with our coordination with our counterparts at Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection and the Coast Guard, this is one of our _x000D_
primary missions, to keep that contraband out of this country."
2925926,2925925,2925927,19241,11,"    But, again, is that 50 percent of your _x000D_
time and effort, 50 percent of the crimes being committed? Is _x000D_
it 90 percent? I realize there is no set percentage, but I just _x000D_
want to get some sort of sense of that."
2925927,2925926,2925928,19241,11,"    Well, because we do keep copious information on _x000D_
our hours spent on our investigative activities, I would _x000D_
venture to say that a little under 30 percent of our time is _x000D_
spent in the area of narcotics interdiction and drug-smuggling _x000D_
investigations. Whether through a task force, we participate in _x000D_
a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force (HIDTA), or _x000D_
through our BEST activity, we are continually working on a lot _x000D_
of drug cases."
2925928,2925927,2925929,19241,11,    OK. So fill in the other 70 percent.
2925929,2925928,2925930,19241,11,"    The other 70 percent includes child exploitation, _x000D_
or counterproliferation investigations. Our responsibility is _x000D_
also to enforce the export control laws of the United States, _x000D_
so we find ourselves in a lot of different areas. In addition _x000D_
there is our immigration portfolio, which includes document and _x000D_
benefit fraud, and identity theft."
2925930,2925929,2925931,19241,11,"    Mr. Alles, can you answer that question _x000D_
for your agency?"
2925931,2925930,2925932,19241,11,"    A general sense is kind of what I am _x000D_
looking for here."
2925932,2925931,2925933,19241,11,"    And, again, so 40 percent drugs. Describe _x000D_
the activities of the trans-criminal organizations."
2925933,2925932,2925934,19241,11,"    What I am trying to get at here is _x000D_
certainly when we came down and visited your site and were down _x000D_
in the Rio Grande Valley, the more we investigate this through _x000D_
our hearings, we are hearing the drug cartels combining with _x000D_
trans-criminal organizations, potentially a nexus with Islamic _x000D_
terror organizations like Hezbollah. I am trying to get some _x000D_
sort of sense specifically what is happening._x000D_
    Mr. Edge, maybe you are the best one to answer that _x000D_
question. Can you give us some sense of what is happening?"
2925934,2925933,2925935,19241,11,"    Well, what we find is that in all the areas that _x000D_
we are responsible for investigating, there ultimately is one _x000D_
motivation, and that is financial. The bad guys around the _x000D_
world want to make money to support these illicit activities _x000D_
that take place all over the world. We have found that through _x000D_
an export control investigation, for example, the investigation _x000D_
that I mentioned out of north New Jersey where the vehicles _x000D_
were being stolen and exported; that money ultimately can be _x000D_
used--we have found in several investigations--for illicit _x000D_
activities that fund terrorist activity."
2925935,2925934,2925936,19241,11,"    Is there a money-laundering aspect to the _x000D_
vehicle smuggling?"
2925936,2925935,2925937,19241,11,"    Yes, sir."
2925937,2925936,2925938,19241,11,"    Can you describe that? Because I have had _x000D_
it described to me, and it is kind of hard to follow."
2925938,2925937,2925939,19241,11,"    Well, as far as the money-laundering aspect of _x000D_
this, and with all the violations that we enforce, there is a _x000D_
money-laundering aspect. We conduct these long-term financial _x000D_
investigations into that aspect by assessing the assets that _x000D_
the organization owns and has, and we try to follow the money _x000D_
through the various accounts. Depending on the nature of the _x000D_
crime, last summer when there was the UAC crisis that was down _x000D_
there at the border, we find ourselves in the situation where _x000D_
we were combating that by following the money. The funds that _x000D_
were being used to support those smuggling efforts, the human _x000D_
smuggling efforts on the southwest border, we were able to _x000D_
identify those accounts and seize that money, working very _x000D_
closely----"
2925939,2925938,2925940,19241,11,"    Can you give us some sense of the dollar _x000D_
volume of, just the transnational criminal organizations? What _x000D_
is the dollar value of the drug trade, of their activities? Can _x000D_
you give us some sort of sense there? Are we talking tens of _x000D_
billions, hundreds of billions of dollars?"
2925940,2925939,2925941,19241,11,"    I cannot give you an exact assessment, but it is _x000D_
in the billions of dollars. No matter what discipline or _x000D_
violation that we are enforcing, whether it is intellectual _x000D_
property theft or any of these other violations, such as human _x000D_
smuggling, there are funds that are used and received to _x000D_
support those activities and to increase the activities into _x000D_
other areas."
2925941,2925940,2925942,19241,11,"    General McCaffrey in testimony before _x000D_
this Committee estimated--and it has not been disputed yet--_x000D_
that we were only interdicting on the southwest border _x000D_
somewhere between 5 to 10 percent of illegal drugs coming into _x000D_
this country. That is through the southwest border. A lot of _x000D_
your activities involve interdicting drugs through the maritime _x000D_
borders. Is it a similar type percentage? Are we only by your _x000D_
estimates interdicting 5 to 10 percent of drugs? Mr. Alles."
2925942,2925941,2925943,19241,11,"    Do you have a sense that we are _x000D_
interdicting a high percentage or a very low percentage?"
2925943,2925942,2925944,19241,11,"    Admiral, do you have any input on that?"
2925944,2925943,2925945,19241,11,"    Yes, sir. The estimate that we have a _x000D_
national target of reducing about 40 percent of the cocaine _x000D_
supply approaching the United States. That is the nationally _x000D_
set target. It has been a graduated target. It is 36 percent _x000D_
this year. It is moving up toward 40 percent._x000D_
    Over the past several years, we have averaged between about _x000D_
11 and 18 percent in terms of maritime interdictions of the _x000D_
known drug flow toward the United States. One of the challenges _x000D_
of that, as was mentioned earlier with regard to maritime _x000D_
domain awareness, is this is illicit activity that is trying to _x000D_
be concealed for detection. So our confidence in what we call _x000D_
the denominator of that, the actual flow, is somewhat limited, _x000D_
but based on best estimates of the intelligence community (IC) _x000D_
and the law enforcement community, in the maritime we interdict _x000D_
in the range of 11 to 18 percent. For the Coast Guard it has _x000D_
been about 450 metric tons over the past 5 years."
2925945,2925944,2925946,19241,11,"    Again, so that just underscores really _x000D_
how unsecure our borders truly are. When we are talking about 5 _x000D_
to 10 percent drug interdiction on the southwest border, 11 to _x000D_
18 percent maritime--again, I am not being critical, but I am _x000D_
just laying out that reality. It is a really sad and _x000D_
frightening reality. Senator Ayotte."
2925946,2925945,2925947,19241,11,"    Yes, Senator. I would add that in the _x000D_
maritime domain, we have seen relatively small quantities of _x000D_
heroin, typically mixed in with loads of cocaine. For example, _x000D_
just about a month or so ago, we had an interdiction of a bulk _x000D_
quantity of cocaine, several hundred kilos, off the coast of _x000D_
Central America, and embedded within one of those cocaine _x000D_
packages was approximately 10 kilograms of heroin. We have also _x000D_
seen that on the Caribbean side, again, in relatively small _x000D_
quantities. But as Mr. Alles mentioned, the vast majority of _x000D_
heroin that comes into the United States does so across the _x000D_
land border, not a maritime border. But our Intelligence _x000D_
Community remains alert to instances of heroin trafficking in _x000D_
the maritime, and to the extent that we can, we interdict those _x000D_
when we know they are coming."
2925947,2925946,2925948,19241,11,"    Senator, if I may, I certainly concur with my _x000D_
colleagues, but also what we have seen with our investigative _x000D_
portfolio, is very similar to what they have seen. Most of the _x000D_
heroin is coming across the land border and the southwest _x000D_
border. But, of course, there is heroin that does come into the _x000D_
interior via commercial aircraft, and then that heroin is then _x000D_
transported to other parts in the Northeast and the Midwest._x000D_
    It is a growing problem, and it is a problem that we see at _x000D_
the Ports of Entry where it is, in fact, commingled with other _x000D_
shipments. You might have a shipment of legitimate goods that _x000D_
might have heroin inserted inside them through containerized _x000D_
cargo, and that is where our BESTs have been very effective._x000D_
    Over the past couple of years, we have seen a lot of _x000D_
commingled shipments, and the number of commingled shipments at _x000D_
our ports of entry are increasing."
2925948,2925947,2925949,19241,11,"    Senator, I think we have done an effective job, _x000D_
and we can always do better, of course, but we have coordinated _x000D_
our efforts both from the investigative perspective and the _x000D_
operational perspective, and also through the sharing of _x000D_
intelligence information. At the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security, the National Targeting Center, which is at CBP, is a _x000D_
place that all this information is vetted and reviewed, and _x000D_
that has been a great source for our investigative efforts as _x000D_
well. We have joined CBP in our efforts in assessing that _x000D_
information that we get from all around the world, not just _x000D_
domestically, so we can use our resources smarter."
2925949,2925948,2925950,19241,11,"    I certainly agree that what happened in San _x000D_
Francisco is a terrible tragedy, and at ICE, we are attempting _x000D_
to work very closely with our law enforcement partners to _x000D_
ensure that circumstances like this will not happen again. And _x000D_
from the investigative side of ICE and Homeland Security _x000D_
Investigations, what we do very well is we work very closely _x000D_
with our State and local counterparts. We try to not only _x000D_
conduct our investigative efforts into areas that affect public _x000D_
safety, like our community shield gang operation where we are _x000D_
arresting and infiltrating gang activity around the country _x000D_
looking to arrest those foreign-born gang members who are _x000D_
committing violence and truly affecting public safety._x000D_
    So one of the things that we will continue to do is work _x000D_
closely with our State and local counterparts and encourage _x000D_
them to work with us, so hopefully something like this will not _x000D_
happen again."
2925950,2925949,2925951,19241,11,"    It would make our job more difficult, but from an _x000D_
investigative perspective, we usually get great cooperation _x000D_
from our State and local counterparts."
2925951,2925950,2925952,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator Ayotte._x000D_
    Before we go to, I guess, Senator Carper, Chairman McCain _x000D_
has got some time constraints. We are going to let Senator _x000D_
McCain ask a question."
2925952,2925951,2925953,19241,11,"    Senator, certainly I have heard those published _x000D_
reports, and we stand ready to----"
2925953,2925952,2925954,19241,11,"    No, I do not."
2925954,2925953,2925955,19241,11,"    We have an office in Mexico City, and they are _x000D_
working very closely with----"
2925955,2925954,2925956,19241,11,"    Yes, sir."
2925956,2925955,2925957,19241,11,    Senator Carper.
2925957,2925956,2925958,19241,11,"    I will try to be brief, Senator. The first _x000D_
one is support for the recapitalization of our offshore patrol _x000D_
fleet, specifically the offshore patrol cutter acquisition. And _x000D_
kind of following up on Senator Ayotte's question before, what _x000D_
would it take for us to be more effective, our effectiveness in _x000D_
our maritime interdiction role is based really on three things:_x000D_
    Information, actionable intelligence. That is generated _x000D_
primarily through General Kelly's command, U.S. Southern _x000D_
Command (SOUTHCOM), and their Joint Interagency Task Force _x000D_
South (JIATF-S)._x000D_
    Aviation. We need fixed-wing air support to locate the _x000D_
targets that JIATF points us to. That is a combination of CBP _x000D_
aircraft, Coast Guard aircraft, and partner nation aircraft._x000D_
    And then we need ships on station, and our long-range _x000D_
cutters, our high-endurance cutters, medium-endurance cutters, _x000D_
and the new national security cutter. And the future OPC _x000D_
equipped with a helicopter flight deck, an airborne use-of-_x000D_
force helicopter, multiple pursuit boats, and a seasoned Coast _x000D_
Guard crew and boarding teams are the most effective package in _x000D_
interdicting these threats, whether drug-trafficking threats, _x000D_
migrant-trafficking threats, or whether those criminal pathways _x000D_
are ultimately used for terrorism."
2925958,2925957,2925959,19241,11,"    We are still examining the marks between the _x000D_
Senate and the House on the----"
2925959,2925958,2925960,19241,11,"    We believe there is sufficient _x000D_
appropriations to continue with our acquisition program of _x000D_
record to recapitalize the fleet. Obviously if we had more, we _x000D_
could do better, but they are sufficient to recapitalize on our _x000D_
program of record which will give us 8 national security _x000D_
cutters, 25 offshore patrol cutters, and 58 fast response _x000D_
cutters for coastal operations."
2925960,2925959,2925961,19241,11,"    That is correct. Our program of record is _x000D_
for the eight national security cutters that are already _x000D_
budgeted for and the offshore patrol cutter that is currently _x000D_
in preliminary design, and that acquisition will stretch out _x000D_
over a number of years into the future as our current medium-_x000D_
endurance cutters approach, some of them have exceeded, and all _x000D_
of them will ultimately exceed 50 years in service before they _x000D_
are retired as these new cutters replace them."
2925961,2925960,2925962,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. From our perspective, _x000D_
our biggest resource is our human resource, and for our Border _x000D_
Enforcement Security Task Forces that we have around the _x000D_
country, we would like to make sure that they continue to be _x000D_
fully funded, and that our State and locals will be collocated _x000D_
with us as well as fully trained in the Federal law that they _x000D_
are going to assist us in enforcing. That is the first thing._x000D_
    The second thing is to have hearings like this and to _x000D_
continue the dialogue on these issues is of significant _x000D_
importance to us to be able to do our job and enlist your _x000D_
support in the work that we are trying to do."
2925962,2925961,2925963,19241,11,"    Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, the Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force South, a DOD command under the _x000D_
leadership of General Kelly and his SOUTHCOM command, has the _x000D_
lawful responsibility for detecting and monitoring illicit _x000D_
traffic coming toward the United States. They do that using _x000D_
both national intelligence means and law enforcement _x000D_
intelligence from not only other complements of DHS but also _x000D_
the Department of Justice (DOJ) and numerous foreign partners. _x000D_
We have terrific foreign cooperation down there that alerts _x000D_
JIATF South to literally thousands of drug movements toward the _x000D_
United States every year._x000D_
    However, as we talked about, we are resource constrained in _x000D_
terms of aviation and surface ships so that only roughly 35 to _x000D_
40 percent of those targets, of those potential targets _x000D_
actually become active targets searched for with aircraft._x000D_
    So the intelligence systems work very well. They do a great _x000D_
job of fusing national level intelligence with law enforcement _x000D_
intelligence, and we have multiple partnerships to keep that _x000D_
happening."
2925963,2925962,2925964,19241,11,"    And for us, certainly working with our _x000D_
counterparts in the Department of Homeland Security is a key _x000D_
and critical part of our intelligence-gathering process and _x000D_
sharing with our counterparts at DOD. So, we find ourselves in _x000D_
situations where we are working very closely with all the _x000D_
COCOMs around the world, in addition to our law enforcement _x000D_
colleagues. And the different centers that we have set up _x000D_
within DHS have been successful in hashing out that _x000D_
information."
2925964,2925963,2925965,19241,11,    Senator Ernst.
2925965,2925964,2925966,19241,11,"    I think if I may, Senator, I will tackle the _x000D_
precursors issue. We have talked a lot about the Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force South, which is focused in the Western _x000D_
Hemisphere, looking primarily at cocaine production coming from _x000D_
South America toward the United States. DOD also has a Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force West, based in Hawaii and looking _x000D_
westward toward Asia, the source of many of these precursor _x000D_
chemicals. One of their primary duties is to track those _x000D_
precursors as they approach Central America. It used to mostly _x000D_
be Mexico, now it is mostly Guatemala. And so they do a _x000D_
reasonably effective job of tracking those precursors. Mexico _x000D_
has clamped down substantially on precursor chemicals coming _x000D_
through that country. Now they are going to Guatemala._x000D_
    So as part of the Southern Border and Approaches Campaign _x000D_
Plan and part of the wider Central America strategy for the _x000D_
entirety of the Federal Government, we are looking to, with _x000D_
multiple partners, improve the governance across Guatemala and _x000D_
the other countries in Central America so they can improve _x000D_
their own port security and do a better job of clamping down _x000D_
both on precursor chemicals and on production."
2925966,2925965,2925967,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator. One of the things that we _x000D_
have seen with the production of precursors, we have 63 foreign _x000D_
offices, including Central and South America, where we have _x000D_
transnational criminal investigative units that have local law _x000D_
enforcement officers that work very closely with our special _x000D_
agents who are in-country. They have been a great source of our _x000D_
ability to identify the production plants for the precursor _x000D_
chemicals. Then we share that information with the intelligence _x000D_
community in the States and with our DHS counterparts in an _x000D_
attempt to be able to identify those shipments when they are _x000D_
coming across the border. So that is one thing that we see._x000D_
    Also, during the course of our investigative efforts, _x000D_
especially in the Midwest and that part of the country, we have _x000D_
had several long-term investigations that have resulted in _x000D_
agents coming across the meth production labs. And one of the _x000D_
biggest problems that we see is that those chemicals are quite _x000D_
deadly. So we have agents who are in these situations _x000D_
spontaneously who find themselves--who could be seriously _x000D_
injured._x000D_
    So we are trying to do our due diligence from the _x000D_
perspective of taking care of our agents to make sure that they _x000D_
have the equipment, they have the knowledge base, and they know _x000D_
how to handle themselves in these various situations. And it is _x000D_
an increasingly large problem that we find ourselves in."
2925967,2925966,2925968,19241,11,"    OK. Thank you for that question, Senator. In _x000D_
talking about the Migration Accords, the Migration Accord or _x000D_
agreement that we have with Cuba dates back to the mass _x000D_
migrations of the mid-1990s. So since the 1994-95 timeframe, we _x000D_
have had agreement that allows for the direct repatriation of _x000D_
Cuban migrants who are interdicted at sea and are then screened _x000D_
to ensure that they are not going to be subject to persecution _x000D_
or torture upon potential return to Cuba. We then have a well-_x000D_
facilitated repatriation mechanism by which Coast Guard cutters _x000D_
go into a particular Cuban port, repatriate those migrants to _x000D_
the custody of the Ministry of the Interior._x000D_
    I had the opportunity from 1998 to 2000 to serve as the _x000D_
Coast Guard's essentially liaison officer to the Cuban Border _x000D_
Guard. And since 2000, we have had somebody permanently _x000D_
stationed at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to help _x000D_
facilitate that part of the relationship, and it is a very _x000D_
professional working relationship that we have with the Cuban _x000D_
Border Guard. And as relationships change with Cuba, we see _x000D_
that potentially being an avenue for continued cooperation in _x000D_
other matters of law enforcement and security."
2925968,2925967,2925969,19241,11,"    We would say with all forms of illicit _x000D_
migration and unsafe migration by sea, they are often driven _x000D_
by, if not the policy itself, the perception of the policy, _x000D_
which is often exploited by criminal migrant smugglers who _x000D_
charge people money on the dream that they will arrive in the _x000D_
United States."
2925969,2925968,2925970,19241,11,"    And, Senator, from our perspective, with our _x000D_
investigative portfolio--and we do run into circumstances where _x000D_
there are migration issues and there are large volumes of _x000D_
them--we usually call our colleagues at the Coast Guard to _x000D_
assist us."
2925970,2925969,2925971,19241,11,    Senator Peters.
2925971,2925970,2925972,19241,11,"    Thank you for that question, Senator. I _x000D_
think I will tackle the ice-breaking piece of it first and then _x000D_
the security aspects._x000D_
    With regard to ice breaking, we have seen record winters, _x000D_
particularly the winter of 2014, and a cooperative agreement _x000D_
between the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard _x000D_
provided ice breaker coverage to the extent that the United _x000D_
States, we are not prepared to provide on our own. We have a _x000D_
number of 140-foot ice-breaking tugs as well as our 225-foot _x000D_
buoy tenders as well as the Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw, our _x000D_
only heavy ice breaker on the Great Lakes._x000D_
    Canada has a little bit more capacity and works with us _x000D_
very cooperatively on ice breaking to keep the shipping _x000D_
channels open as long as possible, and we foresee that _x000D_
relationship continuing in the future. We also have an in-_x000D_
service vessel sustainment program to upgrade the 140-foot ice-_x000D_
breaking tugs to continue them in service for an extended _x000D_
period of time. So we think that from an ice-breaking _x000D_
standpoint, we have sufficient capacity on the Great Lakes for _x000D_
the foreseeable future for most winters, with help from the _x000D_
Canadians in the heaviest periods._x000D_
    With regard to the security relationship, we have a great _x000D_
working relationship with Canadians both from an intelligence _x000D_
and operations perspective. The Coast Guard has a ship rider _x000D_
agreement with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that cross-_x000D_
deputizes officers of the two services to ride on each other's _x000D_
vessels so the border cannot be used as an escape route _x000D_
essentially for someone who is conducting some type of _x000D_
nefarious activity. We also have an intelligence relationship _x000D_
with Canada that allows us to share information both about the _x000D_
border itself and about other threats._x000D_
    And the last point I want to make about Canada is that they _x000D_
also recognize that border threats do not emanate right at _x000D_
their border with the United States. Many of them come from _x000D_
farther away. So the government of Canada, through the Canadian _x000D_
Navy, provides Canadian naval ships that assist us with Coast _x000D_
Guard boarding teams on board to interdict drugs as far away as _x000D_
the coast of South America. So they have been terrific partners _x000D_
in all ways."
2925972,2925971,2925973,19241,11,"    We work that primarily in conjunction with _x000D_
Border Patrol, and I would leave that to Mr. Alles."
2925973,2925972,2925974,19241,11,"    Senator, from the investigative perspective, we _x000D_
have one Northern Border BEST in your jurisdiction, in Detroit, _x000D_
and three others across the rest of the Northern Border. And _x000D_
one of the things that we find is that the partnerships are _x000D_
very strong, both with our foreign counterparts as well as our _x000D_
domestic counterparts, and we are able to share the _x000D_
intelligence information that we get with our counterparts at _x000D_
CBP and Coast Guard._x000D_
    So hopefully in the future we will be able to see the _x000D_
program grow along the Northern Border, because we certainly _x000D_
recognize that there is a significant problem with smuggling, _x000D_
with the use of snowmobiles and skis and the like. So we look _x000D_
forward to communicating with you in the future."
2925974,2925973,2925975,19241,11,    Senator Lankford.
2925975,2925974,2925976,19241,11,"    OK. It is slightly different than that, _x000D_
Senator. The 11 to 18 percent is of the estimated flow, total _x000D_
drug flow toward the United States, we interdict--by weight, we _x000D_
reduce that supply by about 11 to 18 percent with a national _x000D_
target of 36 percent, going up to 40._x000D_
    With regard to individual events about which we have known _x000D_
intelligence, JIATF South and SOUTHCOM estimate that they can _x000D_
only target about 37 percent of those events, but that overall, _x000D_
once they locate a vessel or actual--the Coast Guard's kind of _x000D_
interdiction performance, once a vessel has been sighted as a _x000D_
target, our interdiction performance is between 85 and 90 _x000D_
percent. So it really is a matter of turning the known _x000D_
intelligence into a sighting or a detection that we can then _x000D_
target with the vessel, with the ship-helicopter-boarding team _x000D_
combination."
2925976,2925975,2925977,19241,11,"    I would say that as a government, aviation, _x000D_
long--persistent surveillance, whether it is in the form of _x000D_
fixed-wing aviation, national assets, unmanned systems, _x000D_
persistent surveillance that can be targeted until a very _x000D_
thinly populated fleet of surface vessels can get there."
2925977,2925976,2925978,19241,11,"    Correct. And when you mention the vast _x000D_
ocean, just in the eastern Pacific alone, the area that we are _x000D_
talking about is an area equivalent to the continental United _x000D_
States that may be patrolled by three to four ships at a time."
2925978,2925977,2925979,19241,11,"    All of which have to refuel somewhere on the _x000D_
east coast, notionally speaking. And I mentioned earlier, in _x000D_
addition to the information, much of which we have, the _x000D_
aviation, much of which we do not have, and the ships on _x000D_
station, right now the Coast Guard is significantly challenged _x000D_
by our ability to keep our older ships, our 30-to 50-year-old _x000D_
medium-endurance cutters on station. Last week alone, while we _x000D_
projected to have seven ships on station in the Caribbean and _x000D_
the Florida Straits, we actually only had two because five of _x000D_
them had mission-limiting casualties. And so the _x000D_
recapitalization of our offshore patrol cutter fleet becomes to _x000D_
us the linchpin of success for decades to come."
2925979,2925978,2925980,19241,11,"    Well, thanks to some great efforts by our _x000D_
logistic system, those ships are back up and operating. But, _x000D_
again, we missed almost a week on station for many of them, and _x000D_
that time on station cannot be regained."
2925980,2925979,2925981,19241,11,"    I think perhaps Mr. Alles could comment on _x000D_
that more effectively based on his experience in aviation?"
2925981,2925980,2925982,19241,11,"    In the maritime domain, the number of Cuban _x000D_
migrants that have attempted to come to the United States has _x000D_
upticked over the past 2 years, fiscal years 2014 and 2015, as _x000D_
compared with the 5 years prior. But, still, that level remains _x000D_
below kind of our 10-year historical average._x000D_
    So we perceived a slight uptick shortly after the _x000D_
announcement of change in relationships. As I mentioned _x000D_
earlier, we think that the perception of U.S. policy or _x000D_
potential change in U.S. policy is often a driver of migration _x000D_
and often fueled by migrant-smuggling organizations that profit _x000D_
from that uncertainty."
2925982,2925981,2925983,19241,11,"    That number has since gone back down on a _x000D_
month-to-month basis compared to what we saw in December and _x000D_
January. And, again, it is back down to historical norms now."
2925983,2925982,2925984,19241,11,"    Senator Lankford, let me just enter _x000D_
something into the record, some facts on that. Between December _x000D_
1 and December 16, 2014, the Coast Guard interdicted about 80 _x000D_
Cubans. On the 17, President Obama announced the new U.S. _x000D_
policy toward Cuba. Between December 17 and December 31, 2014, _x000D_
the Coast Guard interdicted 419 Cubans, a 423-percent increase._x000D_
    To address this, the Coast Guard deployed direct _x000D_
repatriation immediately and began sending those interdicted in _x000D_
the waterways back to Cuba. As a result, Cuban interdictions _x000D_
fell to 254 from January 1, 2015, and, according to this have _x000D_
now returned to more normal levels. Is that basically correct?"
2925984,2925983,2925985,19241,11,"    That is accurate, sir. Normally, in the _x000D_
winter months the flow trails off, so those numbers were fairly _x000D_
high. The numbers now month to month are about 300, which, for _x000D_
the summertime, is about normal and certainly well within the _x000D_
normal range. And I would add that this perception of policy _x000D_
issue, as Mr. Alles said before, applies not only to Cuban _x000D_
migrants but to Haitian migrants as well. A few years ago, we _x000D_
saw a significant spike in Haitian migrants trying to go from _x000D_
the Dominican Republic toward Puerto Rico. We were then able to _x000D_
come up with a policy solution to that of expedited removal of _x000D_
Haitians who had landed in Puerto Rico or the islands of the _x000D_
pass between Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and we were _x000D_
able to get a lid on that._x000D_
    So it is a combination of policy, operations, but also _x000D_
public messaging in addition to the additional operations _x000D_
effort that we made."
2925985,2925984,2925986,19241,11,"    So bottom line, U.S. policy creates _x000D_
direct incentives and disincentives for illegal immigration."
2925986,2925985,2925987,19241,11,"    Correct. And as I mentioned before, _x000D_
smuggling organizations absolutely exploit uncertainty or _x000D_
perceived changes in policy to profit from people's desire to _x000D_
get to the United States."
2925987,2925986,2925988,19241,11,    OK. Senator Carper.
2925988,2925987,2925989,19241,11,"    Thank you for that question, Senator. We _x000D_
have had some successes in partnership with CBP on using _x000D_
unmanned aerial systems for interdictions. I recall a very good _x000D_
case off of Puerto Rico where a maritime patrol aircraft first _x000D_
spotted a suspect vessel, then handed it off to an unmanned _x000D_
aerial system that maintained surveillance until a Coast Guard _x000D_
cutter was able to get on scene and do the interdiction. So we _x000D_
have had successes with that._x000D_
    The Coast Guard, in addition to the partnership program _x000D_
with CBP on the Guardian, has also two other unmanned aerial _x000D_
system programs. One is a shipboard UAS program. We have kind _x000D_
of had some fits and starts on that. Some of them, as you have _x000D_
mentioned, Senator, are more people-intensive than we first _x000D_
would have anticipated. In fact, I think within DOD they have _x000D_
actually changed terms from ``unmanned'' to ``remotely _x000D_
piloted'' to put emphasis on the fact that there is still a _x000D_
pilot, just not on board the asset._x000D_
    And then we are also working on small, essentially hand-_x000D_
launched unmanned aerial systems for closer-range surveillance _x000D_
and for a variety of applications. Right now we are testing _x000D_
them in the Arctic for ice breaking, to find leads in the ice _x000D_
and other environmental concerns. So we have multiple programs, _x000D_
all of them in some nascent stage, but we have had some _x000D_
successes."
2925989,2925988,2925990,19241,11,"    Certainly, Senator. The relationship with _x000D_
Honduras has actually been very good lately as a result of the _x000D_
extraditions. The extraditions certainly sent a wave of concern _x000D_
among those who are involved in the criminal organizations down _x000D_
there, and also working very closely with our transnational _x000D_
criminal investigative units that are in that region of the _x000D_
world. We have several, and I think you have been to Panama and _x000D_
have visited there. But that region has been a focus of _x000D_
investigative activity that was certainly enhanced last summer _x000D_
with the unaccompanied children problem that we witnessed._x000D_
    But the relationship is strong, and we certainly anticipate _x000D_
that it will get better in the coming months."
2925990,2925989,2925991,19241,11,    Sure. I was going to as well.
2925991,2925990,2925992,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator. As I mentioned earlier, _x000D_
there is a Central America strategy now developed out of the _x000D_
National Security Council staff, and Vice President Biden is _x000D_
the one who----"
2925992,2925991,2925993,19241,11,"    And I think that is terrific, sir. There are _x000D_
three key aspects to that strategy. They include security, _x000D_
governance, and prosperity. And I think the Coast Guard has a _x000D_
role to play, particularly in security and governance, but _x000D_
leading to prosperity. We talked a little bit earlier about _x000D_
precursor chemicals in Guatemala. So shipping out of Central _x000D_
America toward Wilmington, for example, with bananas and juice _x000D_
concentrates could be an important part of their economy if _x000D_
they had a relief from the pressure of corruption and the _x000D_
corrosive effect of cocaine traffic moving through Central _x000D_
America. So I think the appropriations for funding that _x000D_
strategy are a key component of moving forward there, and from _x000D_
a Coast Guard perspective, we want to put more people in the _x000D_
embassies in the country teams to improve our performance in _x000D_
all three aspects: security, governance, and prosperity."
2925993,2925992,2925994,19241,11,"    Senator, one of the things that we need to do in _x000D_
HSI is make sure we keep allocating the appropriate resources _x000D_
to that part of the world. We want to make sure that we fully _x000D_
staff our offices in that area of the world, so we can continue _x000D_
to collaborate with our foreign counterparts, and that we also _x000D_
maintain connectivity to our domestic offices in the States _x000D_
through this whole joint task force model because that is very _x000D_
important for us to build investigative efforts and also share _x000D_
some of the information that we can with our counterparts in _x000D_
that Northern Triangle region. It is going to be critical to _x000D_
our success to identify the threats before they make it to our _x000D_
shores."
2925994,2925993,2925995,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    Again, I think in the course of these hearings, I think we _x000D_
have both come to the realization and agreement that the root _x000D_
cause really is our insatiable demand for drugs, the root cause _x000D_
of our unsecure border._x000D_
    In evaluating that, though, I think you have to really take _x000D_
a look at the history, and you have to kind of piece the puzzle _x000D_
together. So I wonder if any of our witnesses are willing to _x000D_
really speak to how that all came about. We have an insatiable _x000D_
demand for drugs, which obviously helped the growth of these--_x000D_
the creation and growth of the drug cartels. Drug cartels are _x000D_
businesses, so they are smuggling drugs, and most businesses _x000D_
look to expand their product lines, and that expands into human _x000D_
trafficking, sex trafficking. You are moving humans across the _x000D_
border. Well, let us take a look at illegal immigrants. Let us _x000D_
use them as a diversion for our drug trafficking._x000D_
    Can anybody speak to how those cartels have if not _x000D_
completely destroyed, certainly done great harm to the public _x000D_
institutions of Central American nations? Can anybody kind of _x000D_
speak to the history of that and what the current State is, _x000D_
which is, as pretty relevant as well? Director Edge."
2925995,2925994,2925996,19241,11,"    Sure thing, Mr. Chairman. One of the things that _x000D_
we have seen through our investigative efforts--and, again, the _x000D_
foundation here is our investigations--the demand for drugs has _x000D_
resulted in an insatiable demand for money. And the financial _x000D_
aspect that I mentioned earlier, where we have a financial _x000D_
component to all of our investigations that we conduct, no _x000D_
matter what discipline they are in, there is a demand to make a _x000D_
profit. And that profit certainly is inherent in a need for _x000D_
these cartels to survive, to make more money, to commit _x000D_
corruption in those countries, and that is a big part of it. _x000D_
And that has become part of the culture in those countries._x000D_
    So one of the things that we try to do is, I think, the _x000D_
best course of action that we have taken, to enhance our _x000D_
international footprint, to communicate more effectively with _x000D_
our foreign counterparts at the law enforcement level, and that _x000D_
has yielded some pretty significant results. We have actually _x000D_
gotten an extradition out of a country that we otherwise would _x000D_
not have._x000D_
    So it is things like that that we have to continue to do to _x000D_
really, perhaps, see some progress and, perhaps, see the flow _x000D_
stem a little bit in addition to all-of-government effort to _x000D_
reduce the demand for the product."
2925996,2925995,2925997,19241,11,"    Commissioner Alles, you look like you _x000D_
want to chime in."
2925997,2925996,2925998,19241,11,"    Can you give me a sense of the _x000D_
progression or degradation of those institutions? Are they _x000D_
worse than 10 years ago? Are they getting better than 10 years _x000D_
ago? Admiral Brown, do you have any information on that?"
2925998,2925997,2925999,19241,11,"    I would say, sir, that the closest analog _x000D_
might be Colombia in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and _x000D_
perhaps Central America is in about that condition now, but _x000D_
with a combination----"
2925999,2925998,2926000,19241,11,    Which is not good.
2926000,2925999,2926001,19241,11,"    Which is not good, but also not hopeless. _x000D_
With a combination of significant national effort by the _x000D_
Government of Colombia and the people of Colombia, as well as a _x000D_
relatively small investment from the United States of people _x000D_
and money and time and resources, Colombia has reduced its _x000D_
murder rate, substantially increased its Gross Domestic Product _x000D_
(GDP), and reestablished the rule of law almost over the _x000D_
entirety of the country, with the exception----"
2926001,2926000,2926002,19241,11,"    That took extraordinary leadership, _x000D_
right?"
2926002,2926001,2926003,19241,11,    It absolutely did.
2926003,2926002,2926004,19241,11,"    Unfortunately, leadership--when I say _x000D_
``extraordinary,'' I mean it does not exist very often."
2926004,2926003,2926005,19241,11,"    Right, sir. And so the goal of the Central _x000D_
America strategy is to try to address at the same time the _x000D_
security concerns, the governance, the rule of law, and the _x000D_
institutions there, as well as improving the prosperity so that _x000D_
there is no longer the roots of corruption and also the _x000D_
pressure on people to move out of Central America so that they _x000D_
can rebuild their own countries and economies."
2926005,2926004,2926006,19241,11,"    OK. I will give each of you an _x000D_
opportunity to just make a closing comment, something that, if _x000D_
we have not asked a question, you just want to get off your _x000D_
chest. But I do want to go back to the incentives and _x000D_
disincentives of our own policy, and I want to go back--because _x000D_
you spoke earlier about the problem we had in fiscal year 2013 _x000D_
and 2014 in Haiti. I want to get the numbers on the record. By _x000D_
the end of fiscal year 2013, 1,760 Haitian migrants had _x000D_
attempted to enter the United States through the Mona Passage, _x000D_
as compared to 39 Haitians in fiscal year 2012. So it went from _x000D_
39 to 1,760._x000D_
    And then basically we decided to enact a policy that _x000D_
immediately repatriated those Haitians, correct? Can you _x000D_
describe, first of all, exactly what we did?"
2926006,2926005,2926007,19241,11,"    What had happened, sir, was following the _x000D_
earthquake in Haiti in 2010, we had stopped removal of _x000D_
Haitians. And I have to different between repatriation--in the _x000D_
Coast Guard we use repatriation, maritime repatriation, _x000D_
migrants who are interdicted at sea who return to their country _x000D_
of origin or departure--from removal, which is the process _x000D_
after a migrant has landed in the United States."
2926007,2926006,2926008,19241,11,"    Correct. But, again, repatriation is _x000D_
immediate, and it is noticed immediately."
2926008,2926007,2926009,19241,11,"    So we never stopped post-Haiti earthquake _x000D_
the maritime repatriation process. Thankfully, that continued _x000D_
to work, and there was no increase in migration from Haiti in _x000D_
2010 subsequent to the earthquake._x000D_
    However, the expedited removal of Haitians who were already _x000D_
in the United States was stopped at that time and was not _x000D_
resumed. And by 2013, migrant-smuggling organizations in the _x000D_
Dominican Republic began to take advantage of that by bringing _x000D_
Haitians already in the Dominican Republic to uninhabited _x000D_
islands that are U.S. territory between Puerto Rico and the _x000D_
Dominican Republic."
2926009,2926008,2926010,19241,11,"    So, again, because I really want to get _x000D_
this straight. So U.S. policy, we stopped expedited removal or _x000D_
repatriation back to Haiti, so the reality of the situation was _x000D_
that if you were Haitian and you got in the United States, you _x000D_
felt you had a pretty good chance of staying."
2926010,2926009,2926011,19241,11,    Correct.
2926011,2926010,2926012,19241,11,"    And as a result, we saw a pretty good _x000D_
spike--nothing like we saw with the unaccompanied children, but _x000D_
we saw a pretty good spike of Haitians trying to come to this _x000D_
country illegally."
2926012,2926011,2926013,19241,11,"    Right, accompanied by a spike in deaths and _x000D_
injuries of migrants who were attempting to make that cross."
2926013,2926012,2926014,19241,11,    A pretty dangerous journey.
2926014,2926013,2926015,19241,11,    Correct.
2926015,2926014,2926016,19241,11,"    Which is not a very humanitarian thing _x000D_
for us to incentivized people to take a dangerous journey to _x000D_
lose their life."
2926016,2926015,2926017,19241,11,"    So we did a couple things. First, working _x000D_
with the Government of the Dominican Republic, we asked them to _x000D_
increase their shore-side enforcement to try to stop this _x000D_
traffic from taking place. And within the U.S. Government, we _x000D_
were able to within our Department and with interagency _x000D_
partners--State, Justice, and others--we were able to _x000D_
reinstitute the policy of expedited removal, and ICE _x000D_
enforcement and removal operations began removing migrants who _x000D_
had recently arrived in Puerto Rico or those uninhabited _x000D_
islands, and very quickly, once that became public knowledge, _x000D_
the traffic across that vector essentially dried up."
2926017,2926016,2926018,19241,11,"    My note here says that after the first _x000D_
removal, the maritime flow in the Mona Passage decreased by 80 _x000D_
percent."
2926018,2926017,2926019,19241,11,    Correct.
2926019,2926018,2926020,19241,11,"    OK. I just wanted to get that on the _x000D_
record._x000D_
    Again, I would like to offer each of you gentlemen an _x000D_
opportunity to make a closing comment. We will start with you, _x000D_
Admiral Brown."
2926020,2926019,2926021,19241,11,"    Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to _x000D_
speak before the Committee today, and I will just reemphasize _x000D_
that for us in the Coast Guard, the most important aspect of us _x000D_
being able to maintain maritime border security for decades to _x000D_
come is going to be the recapitalization of the cutter fleet _x000D_
through the Offshore Patrol Cutter Program. So your continued _x000D_
support for that will help us out greatly in accomplishing not _x000D_
only drug interdiction but all the other missions to which we _x000D_
are appointed."
2926021,2926020,2926022,19241,11,"    Thank you, Admiral. Commissioner Alles."
2926022,2926021,2926023,19241,11,    Thank you. Director Edge.
2926023,2926022,2926024,19241,11,"    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for _x000D_
the opportunity to engage in this dialogue today. I certainly _x000D_
appreciate you and the Ranking Member, Senator Carper, taking _x000D_
the time to have this hearing. And as my colleague Mr. Alles _x000D_
just indicated, it is critical that for ICE and the DHS to _x000D_
collaborate and to coordinate our efforts in an attempt to _x000D_
leverage our resources and have this dialogue with you so that _x000D_
we can continue to do that in the future and that we can all _x000D_
have visibility into all that is taking place out there in an _x000D_
attempt to protect our country--or secure our borders."
2926024,2926023,2926025,19241,11,    Thank you.
2926025,2926024,2926026,19241,11,    Thank you.
2926026,2926025,2926027,19241,11,"    I am sure Senator Carper would like to _x000D_
join me in thanking all of you, all three of you, for your _x000D_
service to this Nation, for your testimony, and for taking the _x000D_
time to appear here today._x000D_
    With that, the hearing record will remain open for 15 days, _x000D_
until July 30 at 5 p.m., for the submission of statements and _x000D_
questions for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2926027,2926026,2926028,19241,14,"    Thank you, Senators, for having me here today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Willard appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1525._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I would like to start by thanking people like Doug Griffin _x000D_
who have experienced this tragedy and yet they have the courage _x000D_
to put a face to the epidemic. So I do appreciate the _x000D_
opportunity to sit next to you. It means a lot._x000D_
    As you know, I am the police chief in the City of _x000D_
Manchester, and I speak for all of law enforcement and probably _x000D_
to a degree our fine men and women in the fire department and _x000D_
the AMR ambulance who are out there saving countless lives. But _x000D_
for their heroic actions day in and day out, saving lives _x000D_
through Narcan, this tragedy would be even worse than what it _x000D_
is now. Manchester PD has confirmed 52 fatal overdoses. Those _x000D_
numbers may be different than what AMR tracks, but those are _x000D_
confirmed through the Medical Examiner's Office, with an _x000D_
addition of over 400 calls for service. So as officers are _x000D_
being needed elsewhere, they are responding to medical _x000D_
emergency calls._x000D_
    We are now at a point where we are deconflicting through _x000D_
the DEA those very things. So the Senator went on a ride-along, _x000D_
and went to three heroin overdoses. We took that information, _x000D_
gave it to the DEA, and then were able to deconflict some of _x000D_
that information to see if there's a nexus between each of _x000D_
them. And that is how far this has become._x000D_
    To kind of give you an idea of what we are looking at, we _x000D_
had a shooting in Manchester. We had officers go into an _x000D_
apartment unknown to us previously and we found it to be a drug _x000D_
house. And from that, we did an investigation that led to _x000D_
Lawrence, Massachusetts, and from Lawrence, Massachusetts, _x000D_
directly to Mexico. So now we know that there is a Mexican drug _x000D_
cartel, the Sinaloa drug cartel, that is fueling heroin to the _x000D_
streets of Manchester, New Hampshire. That is alarming. Just _x000D_
last week we shut down three drug houses, all within 100 yards _x000D_
of one another. Two of those drug houses were competing drug _x000D_
dealers, selling out of the same building on different floors, _x000D_
and yet they did so in peace and harmony because there are so _x000D_
many drug users and addicts in the city of Manchester and the _x000D_
surrounding communities that it is a target-rich environment _x000D_
for a drug dealer._x000D_
    So we need help. We already have partnerships through the _x000D_
DEA, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and the Bureau _x000D_
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). However, as I was _x000D_
reflecting on the name for this, All Hands on Deck, on some _x000D_
levels we do that. Chief Burkus from the fire department, Tim _x000D_
Soucy from the health department, and myself have come up with _x000D_
an action plan for 60 days. My task was the enforcements. I _x000D_
have done some high-end prediction enforcement with the New _x000D_
Hampshire State Police. I am going to be doing another _x000D_
initiative through the State Police and the DEA. But it is not _x000D_
enough._x000D_
    When you say ``all hands on deck,'' I look at the Chicago _x000D_
Strike Force model, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task _x000D_
Force (OCDETF). I think that that would give us an opportunity _x000D_
to bring together all Federal partners, local partners, and not _x000D_
just in Manchester, but statewide. And we talk about those _x000D_
small towns and the communities and the county itself. This _x000D_
would bring the full weight of the Federal Government to bear. _x000D_
It would give us an opportunity to actually have a U.S. _x000D_
attorney in the working group with them at all times, so we can _x000D_
have more aggressive prosecutions. Currently, more often than _x000D_
not, we are actually going to the county level to prosecute our _x000D_
drug cases right now because we are just getting better _x000D_
results. They are taking our cases quicker and we are turning _x000D_
them over quicker._x000D_
    However, I would prefer to go the Federal route because we _x000D_
get larger sentences. So having somebody from the U.S. _x000D_
Attorney's Office embedded with the officers who are out there _x000D_
fighting the very issue that we are talking about, let us make _x000D_
no bones about it: We are in the throes of human tragedies _x000D_
every day. And Mr. Griffin is going to speak to that._x000D_
    I believe in the treatment piece. I believe in the _x000D_
education prevention piece, the prevention through education _x000D_
piece. But I am a law man and I believe in enforcement. So _x000D_
every single time a drug addict who would not otherwise commit _x000D_
a crime because they were initially addicted through pain _x000D_
medication, and then they lose their job, and now they are out _x000D_
stealing from vehicles or breaking into houses, every single _x000D_
one of those vehicles is a victim in the city of Manchester. So _x000D_
the opportunity to give these people deferred sentences is not _x000D_
there._x000D_
    We do not have a drug corps. We need something similar to _x000D_
that in Hillsborough County, because I believe everybody needs _x000D_
to be held accountable. Maybe they are given an opportunity _x000D_
through alternative sentencing, but at the end of the day, they _x000D_
did victimize somebody in order to get themselves in the _x000D_
position that they were in._x000D_
    So I guess, moving forward, I believe in the partnerships. _x000D_
We are doing it now. I think the OCDETF model, modeled after _x000D_
the strike force in Chicago, would be a huge help moving _x000D_
forward, at least in my view. Because, currently, we are going _x000D_
after the more low level drug dealers that are causing quality-_x000D_
of-life issues within our neighborhoods. So if I have a drug _x000D_
dealer selling drugs out of a house, they are bringing in _x000D_
unsavory characters, not just from Manchester, but from _x000D_
surrounding towns. Prostitution increases. So people who live _x000D_
there have to wade through prostitutes, other people that would _x000D_
not otherwise be in that neighborhood, and then they steal _x000D_
things coming in and out of that neighborhood._x000D_
    I have decided we are going to take these drug houses out _x000D_
in real-time, but by focusing our efforts on real-time drug _x000D_
dealers to protect the quality-of-life in Manchester, we kind _x000D_
of missed that kingpin piece that we are talking about. And I _x000D_
think that most of that strike force would be a perfect _x000D_
opportunity to have that piece, but also get that aggressive _x000D_
prosecution that I think we desperately need."
2926028,2926027,2926029,19241,14,"    Thank you very much. Before I start my _x000D_
testimony, I would like to let you know that my testimony is _x000D_
based on the person I was before, not now. During all of _x000D_
Courtney's problem with addiction, we were parents that hid her _x000D_
addiction, so we were in a world that was different than the _x000D_
world we are in now._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Griffin appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1531._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    So, Courtney's story. She was born very early, about 5 _x000D_
weeks early, and her lungs were not strong enough to breathe._x000D_
    I have really got to get through this._x000D_
    So she spent the first 11 days in the Neonatal Intensive _x000D_
Care Unit (NICU) center, and we were really worried then that _x000D_
she would not make it. So, then, when we finally got her home, _x000D_
she was strong and she did well, and she started school._x000D_
    We lived in Salem, New Hampshire and she went through the _x000D_
first two grades in Salem. She was always a quiet kid, never _x000D_
talked much. Actually, she talked hardly at all. Then, as she _x000D_
entered third grade, we moved to our home in Newton and she _x000D_
started school there. She was a little chubby and the new kid, _x000D_
so she was sort of shunned, and she did not take well to that. _x000D_
So she did not really like school. She was very smart. I could _x000D_
tell, talking to her and playing games with her all the time, _x000D_
that she was really on top of things. School was not hard for _x000D_
her at all, but she just did not want to go, and a lot of _x000D_
mornings she would be crying, saying she did not want to go to _x000D_
school._x000D_
    She got into middle school and she made a couple of _x000D_
friends, and then things started to turn around for her because _x000D_
she had some friends. Then it was fun to go to school, and the _x000D_
friends would come over to the house and things were good. We _x000D_
thought things were going to go well._x000D_
    When she was 12, we sent her on the People to People _x000D_
program, where she went to Europe and did five countries in two _x000D_
weeks, and she saw things that most people I know still have _x000D_
not seen. When she came back, she was like an adult, and she _x000D_
would speak with adults more easily. It was like it changed her _x000D_
life. It changed our lives. And she was such a strong person _x000D_
that we bought her one of those Verizon prepaid phone cards so _x000D_
she could be sure to call home all the time, and she did not _x000D_
call home once. And when she got home, all the parents were _x000D_
thanking us for her letting their kids use the phone card so _x000D_
they could call home, because they missed their parents. Crazy _x000D_
kid._x000D_
    So when she got to high school, she got her first job, and _x000D_
she was working in fast food at Wendy's here in Haverhill. And, _x000D_
of course, they take the kid that's got the new job and they _x000D_
put them on the crazy hours, so she was working until midnight _x000D_
or later on the weekends. And she did not have a car, so my _x000D_
wife and I were driving her, dropping her off and picking her _x000D_
up. I would sit in the parking lot and wait for her to close _x000D_
every night, because I wanted her to have a job. I wanted her _x000D_
to learn a work ethic._x000D_
    We gave her a car and we were kind of relieved because we _x000D_
did not have to go get her after work. But the people that come _x000D_
in at that hour of the night at closing time are the people _x000D_
that you would never want your kid to associate with. And, of _x000D_
course, they did not have cars, so they needed a ride, and _x000D_
Courtney ended up giving rides to people that, I would never _x000D_
have had her give a ride to._x000D_
    Then she started being late coming home, and then her _x000D_
schoolwork started to suffer a little bit, and pills started _x000D_
missing from our house. Not on a big scale. Some things were _x000D_
missing. Money would go missing. But we were not sure whether _x000D_
we misplaced things or--you do not think someone is going to _x000D_
steal from you in your house at first._x000D_
    So the older she got, she got a little bit more into perk _x000D_
30s. She was talking--she knew the word. She was talking about _x000D_
perk 30s and using drug words around the house that did not _x000D_
belong in our house. We never had them in our house before, and _x000D_
we were afraid._x000D_
    When she was getting ready to graduate from high school, _x000D_
she was accepted at the University of Hawaii. Because if you _x000D_
asked Courtney what she wanted to be when she grew up, she _x000D_
always had the same answer. She said ``Hawaiian. ''_x000D_
    And so I would not let her go, because I was afraid to cut _x000D_
her a check and put her on an airplane for fear that she would _x000D_
just further get into the drug thing. We were afraid at that _x000D_
point. I said, ``You are going to have to come work for me for _x000D_
a while, and maybe take some night classes and prove to us that _x000D_
you are ready to go.''_x000D_
    And she said, ``OK, Dad.''_x000D_
    And she came to work for me. And I have a million parts in _x000D_
my inventory and she came in, she sat down, and she was easily _x000D_
able to handle inventory control. She controlled our inventory _x000D_
without an issue. She did our shipping; she did our receiving. _x000D_
That kid was brilliant. We listened to the radio every day, and _x000D_
outside of one door of my office was my daughter running the _x000D_
computer company and outside the other door was my daughter, _x000D_
Shannon, who is here, running the flower shop. So I had _x000D_
everything._x000D_
    After about six months, she had saved up enough money--_x000D_
thousands from working--because she did not have any bills and _x000D_
did not have anywhere to spend her money and was working all _x000D_
the time. So she went out and got a new car. And on the way _x000D_
home from the gas station, she ran into the boy who led her to _x000D_
heroin. And from that point on, our lives went straight _x000D_
downhill. And at one point in our house, we found one of these. _x000D_
And as you can imagine, nothing could be worse._x000D_
    So we started to try to get her treatment. She ended up in _x000D_
Hampstead Hospital where she was for nine days. When she came _x000D_
home, all she came home with was a list of where every drug in _x000D_
the world came from. Then she started disappearing for longer _x000D_
periods of time, and it started to snowball, and a $7,000 _x000D_
necklace went missing and then checks were written out of my _x000D_
company._x000D_
    And she was still our child, so I did not want to hurt her _x000D_
credit or get her arrested, so we did not tell anybody. We just _x000D_
started to look for help. So we Googled help, and the people _x000D_
that make the most money come up on top, and we just could not _x000D_
get her help. Our insurance company would not cover anything. _x000D_
My wife and I spent 100 hours in emergency rooms, waiting to _x000D_
try to get her admitted. They would keep her for an hour or so. _x000D_
They would release her. Even when the local authorities took _x000D_
her to the hospital, to admit her, they were out three hours _x000D_
later. Would not hold her._x000D_
    Sorry._x000D_
    It got to the point where we were frantic because we knew _x000D_
that we were going to get the call. We knew that she was using _x000D_
drugs heavily. I called the Farnum Center in Manchester and _x000D_
spent an hour and a half there going through an interview _x000D_
process where we were told that she would not be allowed to go. _x000D_
And our insurance company let us know that it was not a matter _x000D_
of life or death, so they would not cover the problem._x000D_
    So we got involved with local authorities who said the only _x000D_
thing you can do is kick her out of your house and cancel her _x000D_
insurance, because if she is homeless, she can get help in _x000D_
Massachusetts. So we kicked her out of the house and canceled _x000D_
her insurance and she moved in with her boyfriend's _x000D_
grandparents. Shortly after that, her boyfriend was arrested _x000D_
and put in jail for a parole violation and she was all alone. _x000D_
Then she totaled her car, and she was further alone. She was _x000D_
just alone in a strange house with strange people._x000D_
    We know who sold her the heroin. He delivered it to the _x000D_
house that night. And she used it and she died of fentanyl. And _x000D_
the State medical examiner told me that it was a strength of _x000D_
about 80 times stronger than she thought it would be and that _x000D_
she did not feel anything. She would have just drifted away. _x000D_
So, in one day, we lost this._x000D_
    And just in closing, this weekend, her boyfriend died--in _x000D_
the same house, in the same room, the same bed--and was buried _x000D_
this week._x000D_
    That's all I have. Thank you ."
2926029,2926028,2926030,19241,14,"    The way I understand it, given the research _x000D_
that I have done, is the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task _x000D_
Force is a single entity made up of Federal, State, and local _x000D_
partners, and that would include a U.S. attorney full-time on _x000D_
staff. I would envision that they probably have room at the _x000D_
facility in Bedford, and that they would work together all the _x000D_
time._x000D_
    So it would be other agencies, local agencies committing _x000D_
personnel to it, being funded by the Federal Government. So you _x000D_
would have somebody from Nashua Police Department, Manchester _x000D_
Police Department, Merrimack, and New Hampshire State Police. _x000D_
Essentially, the more bodies, the better, so any agency that _x000D_
can contribute to them. And then you would have a funded _x000D_
position from the U.S. Attorney's Office who would actually be _x000D_
embedded with law enforcement as they are working through these _x000D_
cases."
2926030,2926029,2926031,19241,14,    Correct.
2926031,2926030,2926032,19241,14,"    It is fantastic. The reason we are staying _x000D_
above completely sinking into the abyss is because of those _x000D_
partnerships._x000D_
    Now, that case that I talked about, where we took 27 kilos _x000D_
of heroin off the streets through that shooting investigation, _x000D_
was simply because of the partnerships that we had with the _x000D_
DEA, the State Police, Massachusetts State Police, and that _x000D_
type of cross-border cooperation."
2926032,2926031,2926033,19241,14,"    Exactly. And all at the same time, everybody _x000D_
sharing the same information, but also everybody bringing in _x000D_
additional resources._x000D_
    When you have a Task Force Officer (TFO) from the city of _x000D_
Manchester, and you are a Federal agency, we pretty much have _x000D_
all that intel at their feet when it comes to dealing with _x000D_
Manchester. So imagine expanding that to the North Country, _x000D_
from the farthest reaches north to the farthest south._x000D_
    One thing we do know is that we have a pretty good grasp of _x000D_
where the heroin is coming from. The majority of it is coming _x000D_
from the Mexican cartels. That, in and of itself, should _x000D_
necessitate Federal action to go after the people that are _x000D_
laundering the money, go after the people that are transporting _x000D_
the drugs, and go after the kingpins that are funneling the _x000D_
drugs._x000D_
    When I met with Mr. Riley this morning and I am looking at _x000D_
a map that I am sure you will see later--when you see what the _x000D_
Mexican drug cartels control of the American landscape, and _x000D_
they are selling their drugs almost with impunity--we are _x000D_
fighting it as best we can, but when you see that map, you _x000D_
realize just how severe of a problem that we have._x000D_
    On the street level, battling this with the fire department _x000D_
and the ambulances, and my officers going from call to call to _x000D_
call, we can only sustain that so long. We need to take these _x000D_
people off of the street and we need to get the head of the _x000D_
snake. And the only way to do that is through some sort of _x000D_
strike force. And that is why I thought it was an important _x000D_
thing to bring up today."
2926033,2926032,2926034,19241,14,"    It was terrible for us because even if _x000D_
insurance had covered it, there were no beds, anyway."
2926034,2926033,2926035,19241,14,"    I mean, everywhere we went, there were either _x000D_
no beds or no insurance._x000D_
    We did not actually find out how bad it was until the end. _x000D_
I mean, we worked and worked and worked and worked, and then _x000D_
she died. And I deal with--now, I get two or three calls at my _x000D_
house every day, from families all around the country wanting _x000D_
help, and all I can do is steer them to the best possible _x000D_
person I know in the area. That is all I can do. Because as far _x000D_
as I know, if it is someone in New Hampshire--I will talk about _x000D_
New Hampshire, especially--if they have a problem, there are _x000D_
very few opportunities for them to enter recovery."
2926035,2926034,2926036,19241,14,"    I think our training is adequate. We do a lot _x000D_
of training through the DEA on these types of issues. We also _x000D_
do Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training, and the Manchester _x000D_
Police Department is actually sending two sergeants out to be _x000D_
instructors for CIT. So I think our training is pretty robust._x000D_
    I think what you saw in those photographs, which I have _x000D_
here if you wanted to put them in the record, is that it was a _x000D_
drug house where the drug dealer would not let you leave. You _x000D_
had to shoot your drugs up while you were there. So we hit it _x000D_
just at the right time and we had 21 people in this two floor _x000D_
apartment._x000D_
    Again, these are competing drug dealers that are not _x000D_
fighting with each other. And what it tells you is that the _x000D_
addiction pool is large. The reason a lot of people are coming _x000D_
to Manchester to sell drugs is because in New Hampshire, they _x000D_
can get two to three times the profit compared to Lawrence or _x000D_
even New York City, depending on where they are coming from. So _x000D_
it is a target-rich environment is what some of the dealers _x000D_
will tell us during our debriefs, because there is a lot of _x000D_
heroin addicts here, because they can make a lot of money. _x000D_
Those 21 people are a perfect example of that phenomenon._x000D_
    Now, law enforcement can do what we can to disrupt the _x000D_
supply, which we have. I think we are well over 30 kilos of _x000D_
heroin coming into Manchester that we have taken off of the _x000D_
street. Officers in the Manchester Police Department routinely _x000D_
are making car stops and finding heroin--62 grams, 33 grams, 40 _x000D_
grams. It is astounding to see the numbers. It is so plentiful. _x000D_
It is everywhere. So even though we are conducting major _x000D_
disruptions in the flow, unless that pool of heroin addicts or _x000D_
fentanyl addicts or now we are seeing crack cocaine is shrunk, _x000D_
we are going to be swimming against the tide. So I am a big _x000D_
advocate for treatment._x000D_
    Now, how you get funding for treatment and what that looks _x000D_
like--I know that there were changes in the insurance company _x000D_
years ago. And once the insurance company said, ``We are no _x000D_
longer going to pay out on detox'' or ``Now we are not going to _x000D_
treat for addiction,'' you saw beds in New Hampshire shrink _x000D_
down from well over 600 to nearly nothing today._x000D_
    So that discussion needs to be with the insurance _x000D_
companies. Can you change the way you do business? Can you now _x000D_
consider or classify detox as something that you can insure? _x000D_
And if you do that, then the beds will increase, because the _x000D_
treatment facility currently cannot put more beds in a facility _x000D_
if the money is not there. I mean, they still have to make _x000D_
money. Even though in their hearts they want to end rediction _x000D_
through recovery--addiction--there is no doubt in my mind. But _x000D_
if there is no money in it, they still have to pay their bills. _x000D_
So there needs to be a way to find, insurance companies or to _x000D_
work with the insurance companies to expand the coverage._x000D_
    I think, most importantly, when I am talking about _x000D_
shrinking that pool of heroin addicts, we really have to focus _x000D_
on these doctors that are giving out dirty scripts and are _x000D_
putting more and more addicts on our streets. And the worst _x000D_
thing you can probably think of is a doctor who, by the very _x000D_
nature of what he does, is willing to put an unbelievable _x000D_
amount of scripts illicitly on our streets that would actually _x000D_
create more drug addicts. Because as soon as those pills dry _x000D_
up, they are going to go to heroin._x000D_
    So that is a whole other piece that we need to look at. We _x000D_
need to look at the medical community and what they are going _x000D_
to do to change their pain management protocol, as well as look _x000D_
at the checks and balances to monitor that._x000D_
    Unfortunately, the State of New Hampshire is well behind _x000D_
the times when it comes to what other States are doing, and we _x000D_
need to make our prescription monitoring program more robust. _x000D_
We have seen some advances, but on a State level, we need a _x000D_
little bit more."
2926036,2926035,2926037,19241,14,    Trying to get better at it.
2926037,2926036,2926038,19241,14,"    Yes. I am about a year into this now and there _x000D_
is a tremendous support community out there that does not have _x000D_
licenses. They are not clinicians; they are people. Our church _x000D_
is amazing. We have a service once a month for addicts and _x000D_
their families, and they come in and they change. I do not know _x000D_
if you have ever seen it happen, but they come in and they are _x000D_
afraid. And parents that have lost kids come in, and they are _x000D_
like me. They are a mess. And, we sit with them, and they come _x000D_
every month. The camaraderie of other people sharing the same _x000D_
experiences, they are helping each other._x000D_
    There is a lot of little Ma-and-Pa things starting up all _x000D_
over the State to help people out. As a matter of fact, we have _x000D_
started one ourselves. And I refer someone to the person I know _x000D_
who is best at it who is closest to them. And I will take _x000D_
anybody's call any hour of the day."
2926038,2926037,2926039,19241,14,"    Get them into the church. I had not been to _x000D_
church in 40 years. And since my daughter died, I am a huge _x000D_
proponent of the support you can get by going to church."
2926039,2926038,2926040,19241,14,"    Thank you, Senator Ayotte and Senator _x000D_
Shaheen for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the _x000D_
Administration's response to the epidemic of opioid abuse, _x000D_
particularly the rise in heroin and overdose deaths._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Botticelli appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1544._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I also want to thank the first panel, and particularly Mr. _x000D_
Griffin, who often at great pain have turned tragedy into _x000D_
action. I think it is important that we carry Courtney's story _x000D_
with us as a reminder of why we do what we do. So thank you _x000D_
very much for sharing that._x000D_
    During my time as the Director of the Office of National _x000D_
Drug Control Policy, we produced the National Drug Strategy, _x000D_
the Administration's blueprint for drug policy. Our strategy _x000D_
treats our nation's substance use problems as public health _x000D_
problems, not just as criminal justice issues._x000D_
    And I do have to pause and thank the gentleman to my left, _x000D_
Commissioner Kerlikowske, who was my boss at ONDCP, for setting _x000D_
this Administration's strategy, and I stand on his shoulders in _x000D_
terms of the work that we are doing._x000D_
    Having led the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services at the _x000D_
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, I am personally _x000D_
familiar with substance use issues in New England. The stark _x000D_
increase in the number of people using heroin in recent years _x000D_
has become a serious public health issue in our country. _x000D_
Overdose deaths involving heroin have increased sharply in _x000D_
recent years. Of the nearly 44,000 drug overdose deaths in _x000D_
2013, heroin was involved in over 8,200 of those, up from 5,900 _x000D_
in 2012. And in New Hampshire, the rates of opioid analgesic-_x000D_
involved deaths and drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin are _x000D_
above the national average._x000D_
    As we have heard, communities and law enforcement are _x000D_
struggling with an increased number of overdose deaths, _x000D_
increased heroin use, and increased heroin trafficking. It is _x000D_
important to note that plentiful access of opioid drugs via _x000D_
medical prescribing and easy access to diverted opioids for _x000D_
nonmedical use is feeding our opioid drug use and opioid _x000D_
epidemic. Approximately 18 billion opioid pills were dispensed _x000D_
in 2012, enough to give every American 18 years or older 75 _x000D_
pills to relieve pain._x000D_
    Even though data indicate over 95 percent of prescription _x000D_
drug users do not initiate heroin use, four out of five newer _x000D_
users to heroin have experience as nonprescription drug users. _x000D_
Given this interrelationship, we must develop a response to _x000D_
heroin use that is part of a response to nonmedical _x000D_
prescription opioid use._x000D_
    A further complicating factor in addressing this epidemic _x000D_
is law enforcement reporting of heroin that is laced with _x000D_
fentanyl, an opioid drug that we have heard to be estimated at _x000D_
80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more _x000D_
potent than heroin. Fentanyl can serve as a direct substitute _x000D_
for heroin in opioid-dependent individuals, but its increased _x000D_
potency can result in even more overdoses, particularly in _x000D_
those users who are not experienced._x000D_
    ONDCP uses its role as a coordinator of Federal control _x000D_
agencies to bolster support for substance use disorder _x000D_
treatment and overdose prevention. In the Administration _x000D_
released a plan to address the sharp increase in prescription _x000D_
opioid drug misuse. This plan contains action items over four _x000D_
areas: education of prescribers to support safer opioid _x000D_
prescribing, increased prescription drug monitoring programs _x000D_
through State-based prescription drug monitoring programs, _x000D_
proper medication disposal, and law enforcement efforts._x000D_
    The Administration has also convened an inter-agency heroin _x000D_
task force, cochaired by ONDCP and the Department of Justice _x000D_
(DOJ), to more closely examine heroin issues and to determine _x000D_
what further actions the Federal Government can take. We look _x000D_
forward to their report later this year._x000D_
    We have seen overdose from prescription opioids leveling _x000D_
off, but, unfortunately, this has been coupled with a dramatic _x000D_
39 percent increase in heroin-involved drug abuse deaths from _x000D_
2012 to 2013. To address the overdose death issue, we are _x000D_
working to increase access to naloxone for first responders and _x000D_
individuals close to those with opioid drug use disorders. Hand _x000D_
in hand with this effort are efforts to promote Good Samaritan _x000D_
laws, so witnesses to an overdose will take steps to help save _x000D_
lives. I am pleased that, in New Hampshire, measures to expand _x000D_
naloxone access and to provide Good Samaritan protection was _x000D_
signed into law this summer._x000D_
    Law enforcement nationwide has risen to the challenge of _x000D_
these increases in opioid use disorders and death. We are _x000D_
working in coordination with members of the public health _x000D_
community. As an example, ONDCP announced earlier this month _x000D_
that we will be providing funds under our High-Intensity Drug _x000D_
Trafficking Area program to develop a heroin response strategy _x000D_
based on a proposal submitted by a coalition of five HIDTAs _x000D_
across 15 States, including the NewEngland HIDTA. The heroin _x000D_
response strategy will foster a collaborative network of public _x000D_
health and public safety partnerships sharing best practices, _x000D_
innovative pilots, information sharing, and identifying new _x000D_
opportunities to leverage resources._x000D_
    We are also working with our Embassy in Mexico, the DEA, _x000D_
the Department of State, and have engaged with the government _x000D_
of Mexico to initiate actions that they can take to reduce the _x000D_
supply of heroin. But it is also critically important that the _x000D_
medical establishment work with us to meet the challenges of _x000D_
overprescribing of prescription drugs and increasing access to _x000D_
treatment. Primary care and emergency physicians have the _x000D_
opportunity for early intervention and treatment before they _x000D_
become chronic, and it is vital that individuals with opioid _x000D_
use disorders receive evidence-based treatment. Medication-_x000D_
assisted treatment with DEA-approved medications, when combined _x000D_
with behavioral health therapies and recovery supports, have _x000D_
been shown to be the most effective treatment for opioid use _x000D_
disorders._x000D_
    In July, the United States Department of Health and Human _x000D_
Services (HHS) announced an additional $33 million in funding _x000D_
to States to expand the use of medication-assisted treatment _x000D_
and an additional $100 million in funding to improve and expand _x000D_
substance use services at community health centers. The _x000D_
Administration's fiscal year budget proposal includes $133 _x000D_
million in new funding to reduce opioid misuse and overdoses, _x000D_
with most of that funding going to efforts at the State level._x000D_
    In addition to the connection given between injection of _x000D_
opioid drugs and infectious disease transmission, public health _x000D_
strategies are necessary to prevent the spread of infectious _x000D_
disease. The recent HIV and hepatitis C outbreak in Indiana is _x000D_
a stark reminder of how opioid use can spread other diseases, _x000D_
how comprehensive public health measures such as syringe _x000D_
service programs need to be part of our response, and how rural _x000D_
communities with limited treatment capacity may experience _x000D_
additional public health crises._x000D_
    In conclusion, our administration will continue to work _x000D_
with Congress and our Federal, State, and local partners on the _x000D_
public health and public safety issues resulting from the _x000D_
epidemic of nonmedical prescription opioid use and heroin._x000D_
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."
2926040,2926039,2926041,19241,14,"    Senator Ayotte and Senator Shaheen, thank _x000D_
you very much._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Commissioner Kerlikowske appears in _x000D_
the Appendix on page 1568._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I was last in New Hampshire in which role to work with the _x000D_
legislature on the prescription drug monitoring program, and I _x000D_
am so glad that that is passed and in place. And thank you for _x000D_
holding the hearing today on what really is an incredibly _x000D_
important, complex, and difficult challenge to the Nation: the _x000D_
increasing trafficking and abuse of heroin and other opioids._x000D_
    Certainly, as I heard from Mr. Griffin, the abuse of heroin _x000D_
in America continues to take too many lives and to tear too _x000D_
many families apart. As a police officer and police chief for _x000D_
37 years, I understand the strain that this epidemic also _x000D_
places on local governments and communities across the Nation. _x000D_
I commend you for holding a hearing about working together._x000D_
    Customs and Border Protection is the one unified border _x000D_
agency. We have a critical role in the effort to keep heroin _x000D_
and other dangerous drugs out of our communities, and we _x000D_
continue to intercept narcotics at the border, all as a key _x000D_
part of addressing this crisis; but interdictions, arrests, and _x000D_
convictions alone, as you have both stated, cannot solve the _x000D_
heroin epidemic._x000D_
    My efforts focused on prevention and treatment in my _x000D_
earlier role, and we certainly support that now. In conjunction _x000D_
with those things, we have to deter drug trafficking through _x000D_
taking down the transnational organized crime routes, cartels, _x000D_
and other distribution networks. And to do that effectively, we _x000D_
need to better integrate our efforts and share information. Our _x000D_
vision and strategy in CDP outlines how we plan to enhance our _x000D_
capabilities through more collaboration, more innovation, and _x000D_
better integration to meet the challenge._x000D_
    Secretary Johnson's Southern Border and Approaches Campaign _x000D_
unifies all of the capabilities of the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security components to integrate intelligence, law enforcement _x000D_
efforts, and to provide a targeted and effective response to _x000D_
these threats, including drug trafficking. I am pleased to _x000D_
support ONDCP's heroin response strategy as recently announced _x000D_
by Director Botticelli and that fosters a collaborative _x000D_
partnership._x000D_
    Our seizures of heroin have been increasing over the past _x000D_
several years, and so far this year, we are 32 percent ahead of _x000D_
last year, and that is on top of continuing increases of _x000D_
seizures. Almost all, of course, are along the Southwest _x000D_
border. We interdict heroin in all the modes, air, land, and _x000D_
sea and in both the travel and cargo environments. _x000D_
Interdictions of regulated opioids, such as fentanyl, have also _x000D_
increased. The majority of that, by the way, is seized at our _x000D_
international mail and express consignment shipments._x000D_
    At the nation's ports of entry, CDP officers use _x000D_
technology, canines, and advanced techniques to spot vehicles _x000D_
modifications and other indicators of smuggling. Between the _x000D_
ports of entry, the border patrol maintains checkpoints and _x000D_
vigilance along the border. The CDP's Office of Air and Marine _x000D_
monitors the complex airway and maritime traffic to identify _x000D_
threats and to interdict contraband. They work with our other _x000D_
agencies, DEA, FBI, ICE, and others, to provide support to _x000D_
them. Because drug traffickers are known to use legitimate _x000D_
modes of travel and transportation, forging partnerships with _x000D_
the private sector is particularly crucial. It is a program _x000D_
that carry your initiative program. We provide training and _x000D_
site surveys for commercial transportation carriers with route _x000D_
systems that are at high risk for drug smuggling._x000D_
    CDP is committed to keeping drugs from crossing the _x000D_
borders, but we are also very committed to the safety of the _x000D_
public we serve. A million people come into the country through _x000D_
our ports of entry every single day. We have implemented _x000D_
naloxone or Narcan as it was talked about in seven of our ports _x000D_
of entry, given the number of cases in which we have had _x000D_
internal carriers. And, of course, we know that naloxone can _x000D_
reverse the effects of an overdose._x000D_
    Well, Senators, thank you for holding the hearing. I look _x000D_
forward to answering any questions."
2926041,2926040,2926042,19241,14,"    Senator Ayotte and Senator Shaheen, thank you _x000D_
for the opportunity to spend some time to talk about heroin and _x000D_
DEA's response._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Riley appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1576._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    DEA's single mission is enforcing the Controlled Substance _x000D_
Act, and heroin has always been a major focus of our efforts. _x000D_
Sadly, today, 120 Americans will die as a result of drug _x000D_
overdose. Heroin and prescription painkillers cause over half _x000D_
of those fatalities. The abuse of these opioids is of epidemic _x000D_
proportions and is currently the Nation's number-one drug _x000D_
problem. New England's no different. 85 percent of the law _x000D_
enforcement agencies here in New England report heroin _x000D_
prescription drugs as the number-one drug threat._x000D_
    I have been with DEA almost 30 years, and I have to tell _x000D_
you, I have never seen it this bad. The vast majority of heroin _x000D_
used in the United States is manufactured outside of the _x000D_
country and smuggled across our Southwest border. In recent _x000D_
years, we have seen an increase in poppy cultivation and heroin _x000D_
processing within Mexico. As a result, Mexican heroin is more _x000D_
prevalent on our streets, accounting for almost half of the _x000D_
domestic supply. The role of Mexican organized crime is _x000D_
unprecedented, with Chapo Guzman's brutal Sinaloa cartel _x000D_
dominating the New England market._x000D_
    Mexican heroin arrives in New England in a number of ways. _x000D_
There are violent gang members and heroin traffickers from New _x000D_
York and Connecticut that have established heroin distribution _x000D_
networks in and around New Hampshire. They operate out of hotel _x000D_
rooms, rental apartments, or obtain the assistance of local _x000D_
addicts. These out-of-state traffickers line their pockets by _x000D_
exploiting the distribution networks to traffic guns and bring _x000D_
violence to your cities and towns._x000D_
    In addition, home-grown traffickers in New Hampshire are _x000D_
obtaining heroin and heroin laced with fentanyl from local _x000D_
distributors. The growing relationship between Mexican--based _x000D_
drug cartels and domestic street gangs, coupled with what I _x000D_
consider an unlimited supply of illegal guns, has really _x000D_
created the perfect storm for law enforcement. In my opinion, _x000D_
this is the new face of organized crime in America._x000D_
    The DEA is evolving with this threat by targeting the _x000D_
highest levels of traffickers and the vicious organizations _x000D_
they run. I have personally spent the bulk of my career chasing _x000D_
the man I consider to be the most dangerous heroin dealer in _x000D_
the world, Chapo Guzman. He and his Sinaloa cartel dominate the _x000D_
U.S. heroin market and his organization has reached to the _x000D_
extent of New Hampshire's urban and rural centers. DEA focuses _x000D_
its limited resources on disrupting and dismantling these _x000D_
organizations. That means targeting the intersection between _x000D_
Mexican organized crime and the violent urban gangs _x000D_
distributing the heroin on their behalf. This relationship _x000D_
between these two criminal entities is best described as toxic _x000D_
and dangerous._x000D_
    Heroin can be found now in virtually every part of our _x000D_
country. Sadly, its regional presence is growing. In New _x000D_
Hampshire, heroin overdoses have more than tripled from 2008 to _x000D_
2013. In 2015 alone, there have been at least 176 deaths _x000D_
involving opioids and over three-quarters of those involved _x000D_
fentanyl._x000D_
    Today, heroin is far different than it was just five years _x000D_
ago. It is cheaper, higher in purity, and can be smoked or _x000D_
snorted, much like powdered cocaine. And there is no typical _x000D_
heroin addict. This problem transcends demographic and socio-_x000D_
economic lines. Knowing this drug is the source of so much _x000D_
violence and misery is truly what keeps me up at night. I know _x000D_
from experience that the more we do to reduce drug crime, the _x000D_
more we will reduce all violent crime._x000D_
    While I was a special agent in charge of the Chicago Field _x000D_
Division, we developed a model of cooperation and collaboration _x000D_
that I truly believe is making a difference there and across _x000D_
the country. The Chicago Heroin Strike Force began with the _x000D_
shared belief amongst Federal, State, and local law _x000D_
enforcement, political leaders, community leaders, and _x000D_
prosecutors, that together we could effectively target the _x000D_
violent organizations distributing heroin. This new and _x000D_
innovative approach allows us to work from the street level to _x000D_
prevent violent crime while, at the same time, to pursue the _x000D_
investigations at the highest levels of the cartel leadership, _x000D_
wherever that takes us. We are actively looking to apply this _x000D_
model to DEA divisions across the country._x000D_
    Just as we cannot separate violence from drugs, we cannot _x000D_
separate controlled prescription drug abuse from heroin. As a _x000D_
result, DEA has established highly effective tactical diversion _x000D_
squads--some 66 in total--that are committed to targeting the _x000D_
critical nexus between diversion, prescription drugs, and _x000D_
heroin._x000D_
    In addition, we are taking steps to remove unwanted, _x000D_
unneeded, and expired prescription drugs from medicine _x000D_
cabinets. In fact, on September 26, 2015, DEA will host its _x000D_
10th National Takeback Initiative._x000D_
    I know, firsthand, these threats are an urgent challenge _x000D_
and a danger to our community and the lives of our citizens. _x000D_
Law enforcement is not the sole answer. Prevention, treatment, _x000D_
education, awareness are critical to our success. Everyone _x000D_
plays a role, from parents, community leaders, educators, _x000D_
faith-based organizations, cultures and athletics, to the _x000D_
medical community._x000D_
    This is a marathon, not a sprint, but together we can _x000D_
produce the results that you seek and New Englanders demand._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926042,2926041,2926043,19241,14,"    I think it is increasingly important that we _x000D_
share information. I will tell you the bad guys really count on _x000D_
law enforcement not talking to each other and not connecting _x000D_
the dots. This particular approach, the strike force idea, _x000D_
really cements relationships across State, Federal, and local _x000D_
lines. You heard the chief say--by the way, the citizens of _x000D_
Manchester are lucky to have a chief like that. He sees it for _x000D_
what it is."
2926043,2926042,2926044,19241,14,"    He is willing to attack it. He understands the _x000D_
role of treatment and prevention. And I do think the strike _x000D_
force was successful in Chicago because of that same _x000D_
commitment."
2926044,2926043,2926045,19241,14,"    I think it is a really excellent idea. Part _x000D_
of the design and delivery of the HIDTA program is precisely _x000D_
along those points. So we can follow up with the chief and Jay _x000D_
Fallon from our HIDTA program to talk about what are the _x000D_
opportunities here to replicate that kind of model, to really _x000D_
look at how we go after the criminal organizations, and not the _x000D_
people with addiction, I think that is really important to do._x000D_
    So the whole intent of actually for our information _x000D_
sharing, our HIDTA money was to support this. So we will follow _x000D_
up with the chief and with our HIDTA program and with other _x000D_
Federal partners to look at what are the opportunities to bring _x000D_
that here."
2926045,2926044,2926046,19241,14,"    And should it come to fruition, we would _x000D_
be happy to assign personnel to that OCDETF task force to _x000D_
provide some assistance."
2926046,2926045,2926047,19241,14,"    When you look at the consequence of opioid _x000D_
addiction in the United States, it is a perfect track in terms _x000D_
of looking at the increase in prescriptions. And, I love your _x000D_
chief. But I would add that, while we need to go after bad _x000D_
doctors and over prescribing, this is much more prolific than _x000D_
just bad doctors prescribing. Clearly, we want to target our _x000D_
law enforcement efforts. But we really have to enhance medical _x000D_
education for every prescriber around this issue. States now _x000D_
actually mandate some level of continuing medical education. We _x000D_
at ONDCP continue to support Federal legislation for mandatory _x000D_
prescriber education. As I have said before, in the midst of an _x000D_
epidemic, I do not think it is too much to ask a medical _x000D_
provider to take some limited medical education to do that._x000D_
    Clearly, State boards play a huge role in terms of looking _x000D_
at both prescribing guidelines as well as scrutiny of _x000D_
physicians who might be overprescribing. Prescription _x000D_
monitoring programs play a key role, because we know that many _x000D_
people who start developing an addiction go from one doctor to _x000D_
another. So these programs need to be strong, they need to be _x000D_
real time, but they also need to be easily accessed by _x000D_
physicians. So it is not enough that we have these databases, _x000D_
we also have to make sure that prescribers are using them._x000D_
    So, again, this is a multi-prong issue, but dealing with _x000D_
both prescribing and providing good information to prescribers _x000D_
is particularly important."
2926047,2926046,2926048,19241,14,"    I have worked with two administrations, _x000D_
President Calderon and the cooperation is very good. We have _x000D_
invested a lot of money in training with Mexico. They have just _x000D_
put together a force of over 5,000 highly trained individuals. _x000D_
We have invested in 10 sites on the border so that we have _x000D_
joint communication, so that our border control on one side of _x000D_
the border can talk directly through an encrypted system to _x000D_
Mexican officials, rather than making multiple ways of _x000D_
communication._x000D_
    So the cooperation can be very good. I think there is one _x000D_
area where we should look, and that is eradication. When _x000D_
President Calderon took on the cartels--courageously, in my _x000D_
opinion--he used the military, and the military had also been _x000D_
involved in eradicating poppy and marijuana. As he moved them _x000D_
into more of a law enforcement role, I believe their _x000D_
eradication numbers have decreased. I think in a classified _x000D_
briefing you probably get information on the amount of poppy _x000D_
that is being grown and produced in Mexico. Eradication is not _x000D_
the sole answer, but it needs to be part of the method."
2926048,2926047,2926049,19241,14,"    I used to be charge of a DEA office along the _x000D_
border about 10 years ago, and I can tell you that we did not _x000D_
share a lot of information 10 years ago because it never went _x000D_
where we wanted it to go._x000D_
    We have vastly improved our ability to operate. Our agents _x000D_
now work side-by-side with Mexican law enforcement and military _x000D_
daily, so that relationship has improved. Our ability to _x000D_
extradite key traffickers has improved. Those, I think, are the _x000D_
cornerstones of how we are going to turn the tide. But it is _x000D_
really crucial for us to share information. There are _x000D_
investigations going on now where they share information with _x000D_
us that actually affects the streets of U.S. cities. So it is _x000D_
both ways._x000D_
    Now, is there room for improvement? Absolutely. But we are _x000D_
going to strive to continue that dialogue, because I think, in _x000D_
the long run, that is going to be the most effective strategy."
2926049,2926048,2926050,19241,14,"    You certainly have the right witness in _x000D_
General Kelly, and my time with General Fraser before him and _x000D_
my time with Admiral Stavridis when I came in._x000D_
    So you have an absolute model in Key West, Florida called _x000D_
the Joint Interagency Task Force South. It is from the Coast _x000D_
Guard to the military to every Federal law enforcement agency, _x000D_
and when you go into that facility, you cannot tell what badge _x000D_
or what uniform anybody is wearing. There is one mission and it _x000D_
is the most unified concept. It has been well written about. _x000D_
They are tremendous at targeting, because random patrol in a _x000D_
police department produces random results. That is why this _x000D_
reduction in crime over the last 10 years, I think is the _x000D_
result of putting police in the right locations at the right _x000D_
times._x000D_
    That is the same with the drug trafficking issues. And as _x000D_
we see things like semi-submersibles and others, our ability to _x000D_
random patrol, whether with RP-3s or the Navy, et cetera, _x000D_
random patrol is not going to produce anything. It is _x000D_
intelligence and it is targeting._x000D_
    Here is the difficulty--and I think you know this very well _x000D_
and that is, it is like when I was a police chief in Seattle. _x000D_
If you called and said, ``They are robbing the 7-Eleven,'' and _x000D_
I said, ``Gee, I am really sorry. I do not have anybody to _x000D_
send.'' And that is exactly the situation that Giana South and _x000D_
others are in. They target information and they have no _x000D_
resources to send to interdict that. That happens far too _x000D_
often. And I would say that those resources are necessary, and _x000D_
I think as Secretary Johnson and others, including myself, have _x000D_
expressed, sequestration would be very difficult for us to _x000D_
overcome."
2926050,2926049,2926051,19241,14,"    Sure._x000D_
    While we have had great support for our prescription drug _x000D_
monitoring programs, we, in essence, have the same funding _x000D_
level for our now 49 prescription drug monitoring programs as _x000D_
we did when we had 20. Clearly, we heard here, as we have heard _x000D_
across the country, that you cannot only have one robust State _x000D_
program, given the ability for people just to go across State _x000D_
lines, to go to another State if we do not have that. So _x000D_
information sharing and what we call interstate operability, _x000D_
the ability of state prescription drug monitoring programs to _x000D_
share data across State lines, become critically important. I _x000D_
am very familiar with the New England region. It is very easy _x000D_
when you have one State that has a robust program for people to _x000D_
go across to other States._x000D_
    So having a robust prescription drug monitoring program, _x000D_
the ability for States to share that information across State _x000D_
lines, the ability to share that information in a de-identified _x000D_
way, with public health and public safety folks, become really _x000D_
important. As the commissioner said, we are always going to _x000D_
have finite resources and our ability to target, whether it is _x000D_
at a local level or at a county level, become really important. _x000D_
Those programs have really valuable information in terms of _x000D_
looking at what are hot spots in terms of overprescribing in _x000D_
various parts of our State and our Nation."
2926051,2926050,2926052,19241,14,"    Well, I think it is one of many things that _x000D_
causes me to lose sleep, because it is really extremely _x000D_
dangerous--clearly to the trapped person, to the addicts, but _x000D_
to first responders, as well like the hard-working policeman _x000D_
that pulls somebody over. It is 50 times stronger than heroin. _x000D_
It can be absorbed through the skin or airborne and breathed _x000D_
in, and it is extremely toxic. We are beginning to see it more _x000D_
and more across the country. Unfortunately, what we have seen _x000D_
here in the Northeast is really at a much higher level._x000D_
    Fentanyl, for the most part, is being produced _x000D_
clandestinely in Mexico, primarily by the Sinaloa Cartel. You _x000D_
can see from the map where the stronghold of the cartels are _x000D_
located, specifically in the eastern part of the United States. _x000D_
So, again, the key for us in Mexico is to make sure that we _x000D_
share the information when we develop information here, so that _x000D_
we can work it back._x000D_
    And to give the police chief another shout-out, he _x000D_
recognizes that. He recognizes that we really have to work the _x000D_
street level to prevent violence. But for us to be successful, _x000D_
we have to jointly work these things back as far as we can go._x000D_
    So, right now, I would say fentanyl, if it has not gotten _x000D_
every law enforcement officer's attention, it certainly will. _x000D_
We are doing everything we can to train and to get the word _x000D_
out, because it is a toxic substance."
2926052,2926051,2926053,19241,14,"    Yes, ma'am."
2926053,2926052,2926054,19241,14,"    Yes, ma'am._x000D_
    And yet, under our laws, essentially the scheduling of _x000D_
fentanyl is not treated properly, in terms of quantities, as it _x000D_
is with regard to heroin._x000D_
    So I recently introduced the Stop Trafficking in Fentanyl _x000D_
Act to bring parity to the penalty regime, and I just wanted to _x000D_
get your thought on this issue--especially as we look at how _x000D_
deadly fentanyl is--of whether we are really making sure that _x000D_
we are treating it with the seriousness under our Federal _x000D_
statutes that it deserves. I wanted to get your thought on _x000D_
that."
2926054,2926053,2926055,19241,14,"    Yes. We have the DEA that is reviewing the bill. _x000D_
We worked closely on the technical side with your staffers. I _x000D_
think it is extremely important for us to have a balanced _x000D_
approach to the emerging threat._x000D_
    Fentanyl is clearly the reason many people are overdosing. _x000D_
So anything we can do to balance that--I am speaking as a cop, _x000D_
from my experience--is another tool, I think, that would _x000D_
benefit us across the board."
2926055,2926054,2926056,19241,14,"    Yes, ma'am."
2926056,2926055,2926057,19241,14,"    Sure. as she was testifying, and as someone _x000D_
who was in charge of State licensing practices at one point, _x000D_
there is probably, I think, Federal issues, but there are also _x000D_
State-level licensing issues involved._x000D_
    So I think we can have a follow up conversation to learn a _x000D_
little bit more about what regulations are under the purview of _x000D_
the Federal Government and then determine what are under the _x000D_
State licensing authority, because I think it is really _x000D_
important. And as I was listening to her, I was thinking that _x000D_
many of the things that she, I think, is talking about fall _x000D_
under State licensing areas. But we would be happy to work with _x000D_
her in terms of those areas."
2926057,2926056,2926058,19241,14,"    I want to thank both you and Senator _x000D_
Shaheen in terms of your leadership at the Federal level. There _x000D_
are significant pieces of Federal legislation that I think _x000D_
speak to many of the issues that we talked about today. _x000D_
Certainly, CARA, I think, highlights many of the issues and _x000D_
fills really critical gaps, not only in terms of funding, but _x000D_
in terms of policy around this issue._x000D_
    So we know it is not enough just to reduce--to reverse _x000D_
overdoses. Addiction is a chronic disease and we need to have _x000D_
really good continuum of care, including prevention, treatment, _x000D_
and recovery support. And so that is critical to be able to do _x000D_
that._x000D_
    I think there are lots of additional opportunities that we _x000D_
can continue to work on together, particularly around _x000D_
prescribing behavior and about continuing to look at enhancing _x000D_
our prescription drug monitoring programs, as well as thinking _x000D_
about critical treatment resources that I know the State and _x000D_
locals critically need in terms of dealing with addiction _x000D_
issues."
2926058,2926057,2926059,19241,14,"    I think that is, at least from my _x000D_
standpoint, a simple question. It is really about resources. I _x000D_
think that we know that New Hampshire--we heard from providers _x000D_
who were talking about wait lists. When people are ready to get _x000D_
care, we should be able to give them care. So, resources, but _x000D_
also, clearly insurance plays a huge role in this. We know that _x000D_
only about 11 percent of people who have an addiction get care _x000D_
at a specialty treatment center, and often addicts cite lack of _x000D_
insurance coverage as a reason for not seeking care._x000D_
    So we need to make sure we have good insurance coverage, _x000D_
both private and Medicaid, but we also know that there are _x000D_
people who will remain uninsured and who also need services _x000D_
that insurance will not pay for. So, clearly, having those _x000D_
resources at the State and local level become very important."
2926059,2926058,2926060,19241,14,"    As I think it has been agreed on, we are _x000D_
not going to interdict or arrest our way out of the problem. _x000D_
And as important as it is to take down the cartels and the _x000D_
organizations, the traffickers with significant penalties, both _x000D_
civil and incarceration for them, I think that the prevention _x000D_
programs, the community coalitions that do the prevention work _x000D_
that have been underfunded, and they are incredibly _x000D_
inexpensive. And yet when you go to any of those meetings, and _x000D_
you sit and listen to these people that spend so much of their _x000D_
time, especially like listening to Mr. Griffin taking calls at _x000D_
home--and I do not think that is probably part of his job that _x000D_
he is being paid for--those community coalitions could really _x000D_
use some help with resources."
2926060,2926059,2926061,19241,14,"    From a law enforcement point of view, the one _x000D_
thing that would help is if law enforcement across the country _x000D_
really recognized the critical link between Mexican organized _x000D_
crime and urban street gangs. I do not think we can go anywhere _x000D_
throughout the country where we do not see that connection. So _x000D_
education and resources, things like the OCDETF strike force, _x000D_
where we target those intersections that affect the quality of _x000D_
life in our community, but at the same time make sure that we _x000D_
go after the highest level traffickers we can, it is evolving _x000D_
across the country and we have to face it."
2926061,2926060,2926062,19241,16,"    Good morning. This hearing will be called _x000D_
to order._x000D_
    I want to welcome all of our witnesses. Thank you for _x000D_
taking the time to appear here, for your thoughtful testimony, _x000D_
and for your willingness to answer our questions._x000D_
    This is our 12th hearing on the lack of security on our _x000D_
border. We have also had three roundtables. This hearing, like _x000D_
the previous hearings, is really just a very sincere attempt on _x000D_
this Committee's part to try and lay out the reality. I come _x000D_
from a manufacturing background. I have had to solve a lot of _x000D_
problems, and it starts with describing the reality and _x000D_
acknowledging it. Sometimes you do not like looking at the _x000D_
reality, and I would say that is certainly the case with the _x000D_
problem of our unsecure borders and the level of illegal _x000D_
immigration out of certainly Central America and Mexico. These _x000D_
are tough problems. It is what I call the true definition of a _x000D_
problem, something that does not have real easy solutions, _x000D_
which is why we have been grappling with this thing for _x000D_
decades._x000D_
    Later this month, in further fact finding, we are going to _x000D_
be taking a trip, the Members of the Committee, to Central _x000D_
America to see the conditions on the ground there, which, let _x000D_
us face it, we acknowledge the fact that people love to live in _x000D_
America. This is the land of opportunity. It is a land of _x000D_
immigrants. Through our history, generation after generation, _x000D_
waves of immigrants have come here and made our country strong. _x000D_
But it has to be a legal process. It has to be an orderly _x000D_
process._x000D_
    In a few weeks, maybe a couple days; I am going through the _x000D_
final editing process--we are going to be releasing a report on _x000D_
those 12 hearings and what we have learned. I think I can _x000D_
describe it a little bit in terms of, what the conclusions of _x000D_
that report are._x000D_
    First and foremost--and this is, I think, shared by my _x000D_
Ranking Member and everybody on this Committee--our borders are _x000D_
not secure. They are just not secure. If you want to have one _x000D_
piece of information, one metric that tells you how unsecure _x000D_
our border is, General McCaffrey testified that they were only _x000D_
interdicting 5 to 10 percent of illegal drugs coming through _x000D_
the Southern Borders. That is how unsecure it is._x000D_
    Now, we have to secure our borders for a number of reasons, _x000D_
not just the illegal immigration issue but for national _x000D_
security, for public health and safety. This is a serious _x000D_
matter. It deserves serious attention. And, again, that is the _x000D_
purpose of these hearings._x000D_
    I think one conclusion of our report of these hearings is _x000D_
also that there are multiple causes, multiple root causes. But _x000D_
from my standpoint looking at this, probably the root cause of _x000D_
our unsecure borders is literally our insatiable demand for _x000D_
drug in this country that for decades basically gave rise to _x000D_
the drug cartels that are businesses. They developed those _x000D_
drug-trafficking routes, and they started expanding their _x000D_
product line to human trafficking, to sex trafficking, and all _x000D_
manners of deprivations as a result of those things. So, we _x000D_
bear responsibility in this country for our insatiable demand _x000D_
for drugs. We need to understand that._x000D_
    We also have to understand, too, that within our _x000D_
immigration system we have created, unintentionally--with the _x000D_
best of intentions, quite honestly--a number of incentives for _x000D_
illegal immigration. We need to honestly look at those _x000D_
incentives, and we need to ask ourselves, Is there anything we _x000D_
should do to change those laws, change those regulations that _x000D_
actually incentivized people to come here illegally as opposed _x000D_
to coming here in a legal and orderly process?_x000D_
    I would argue--and, of course, the purpose of this hearing _x000D_
today is really talking about the continuing crisis. And it is _x000D_
a continuing crisis of unaccompanied children coming across our _x000D_
borders illegally._x000D_
    I would turn everybody's attention to our first chart\1\ _x000D_
here, which shows the history of unaccompanied children coming _x000D_
to this country illegally since 2009. And you can see the line _x000D_
of demarcation there, being Deferred Action on Childhood _x000D_
Arrivals in 2012, which I would say goes a long way toward _x000D_
explaining why we have had this explosion._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Johnson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1831._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Now, it is true that the biggest problem we have is in _x000D_
2014, but now that the figures from 2015 are in, yes, we are _x000D_
down from 51,705 unaccompanied children from Central America _x000D_
coming to this Nation from 2014, but in 2015, it is still _x000D_
28,387. I would say by any measure still at crisis levels._x000D_
    Now, we have gotten better at processing them. We have _x000D_
gotten better at dispersing them in a humane fashion, and that _x000D_
is not a bad thing that we are treating these people with _x000D_
humanity. We are America. We are going to show that kind of _x000D_
compassion. But, unfortunately, I think it continues to _x000D_
incentivize more individuals coming here, and I think the next _x000D_
graph\1\ is something we also have to take a look at. Because _x000D_
we often just talk about unaccompanied children. We have also _x000D_
created some additional incentives now for family units, and so _x000D_
we have seen a real spike in the number of family units coming _x000D_
in here because, you know, our policy now is to no longer _x000D_
really hold them in detention centers, but also send them _x000D_
throughout the country, again, in a human fashion--I understand _x000D_
that--but it is incentivizing more individuals to come into _x000D_
this country illegally, and we have to really face that _x000D_
reality._x000D_

    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Johnson appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 1832._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    I would ask unanimous consent to enter my written statement _x000D_
into the record.\2\ We have five witnesses here, so I do not _x000D_
want to belabor the point any further. But the bottom line is _x000D_
we have to face these realities. We have to ask ourselves some _x000D_
hard questions, and we have to start solving this problem for _x000D_
the reasons I have stated._x000D_

America._x000D_
    Unaccompanied alien children (UACs), crossed the U.S.-_x000D_
Mexican border in record numbers in fiscal year (FY) 2014. Most _x000D_
of these UACs were from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. A _x000D_
recent surge in August 2015 has renewed concerns about the _x000D_
efforts being taken by U.S. agencies to address the causes of _x000D_
migration. We issued a report in July 2015 that focused on U.S. _x000D_
agency efforts to address these causes. Today my statement will _x000D_
focus on our conclusions and recommendations from that report, _x000D_
as well as some updated information on the recent surge._x000D_
    According to U.S. officials, the increase in migration _x000D_
since 2012 was likely triggered by several factors, such as the _x000D_
increased presence and sophistication of child smugglers, or _x000D_
coyotes, and confusion over U.S. immigration policy. For _x000D_
example, agency officials told us that in some cases coyotes _x000D_
led many people to believe children could migrate to the United _x000D_
States and receive permission to stay indefinitely if they _x000D_
arrived by a certain date._x000D_
    Additionally, Honduran youth and coordinators of community _x000D_
centers who were interviewed as part of a U.S Agency for _x000D_
International Development (USAID) focus group indicated that _x000D_
they believed the United States would allow migrant minors, _x000D_
mothers traveling with minors, and pregnant women to stay for a _x000D_
period of time upon arrival in the United States._x000D_
    Social media also plays a factor in migration. Officials in _x000D_
Guatemala told us that social media outlets enable migrants who _x000D_
arrive in the United States to share messages and pictures with _x000D_
families in their home countries. This can serve as a powerful _x000D_
and influential endorsement of the decision to migrate. _x000D_
Additionally, officials noted that persistent conditions such _x000D_
as violence, poverty, and the lack of economic opportunity have _x000D_
worsened._x000D_
    We met with children in all three countries, and they _x000D_
echoed many of the same reasons for migrating to the United _x000D_
States._x000D_
    For example, children at a USAID outreach center in San _x000D_
Pedro Sula, Honduras, noted the lack of educational and job _x000D_
opportunities in their communities as a reason for migrating. _x000D_
Children from a particularly violent neighborhood told us it _x000D_
was even more difficult for them to find employment since _x000D_
potential employers would sometimes choose not to hire them _x000D_
simply because of where they lived._x000D_
    A number of U.S. agencies have programs providing _x000D_
assistance in areas such as economic development, community _x000D_
development, law, citizen security, rule of law enforcement, _x000D_
and education._x000D_
    Some program address longstanding concerns while others _x000D_
were developed to address the recent surge in migration. For _x000D_
example, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led units _x000D_
supported an increased focus on investigating and dismantling _x000D_
smuggling operations in all three countries. We found that U.S. _x000D_
agencies chose to locate programs in the three countries based _x000D_
on various factors, including high poverty and crime, but _x000D_
adjusted their efforts to locate more programs in high _x000D_
migration communities._x000D_
    With regard to evaluation, we found that most agencies had _x000D_
developed processes to assess the effectiveness of UAC _x000D_
migration-related programs, but there were weaknesses. For _x000D_
example, DHS had established performance measures such as _x000D_
arrests for units combating UAC smuggling, but had not _x000D_
established numeric or other types of targets for these _x000D_
measures which would enable the DHS to measure the unit's _x000D_
progress toward a stated goal._x000D_
    In addition, DHS and State had not always evaluated the _x000D_
information campaigns intended to combat coyote misinformation. _x000D_
For example, DHS launched its 2013 campaign in April of that _x000D_
year, but launched its 2014 campaign in late June, which was _x000D_
after the migration levels had peaked. Neither agency evaluated _x000D_
the effect of its 2014 campaign._x000D_
    Public affairs officers from all three countries expressed _x000D_
uncertainty or doubt concerning the effectiveness of campaigns _x000D_
centered on the dangers of migration. Specifically, they were _x000D_
uncertain whether such campaigns resonated with citizens of the _x000D_
three countries since the dangers were already well known._x000D_
    Accordingly, we recommended that the agencies integrate _x000D_
evaluations into their information campaigns intended to deter _x000D_
migration and that DHS establish performance targets for its _x000D_
investigative units._x000D_
    This concludes my opening remarks. Thank you for the _x000D_
opportunity to testify on this very important topic, and I am _x000D_
prepared to answer any questions you might have."

2926070,2926069,2926071,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. I am grateful for the _x000D_
opportunity to address the honorable Members of this Committee._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Casas-Zamora appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1643._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Over the past 5 years, 100,000 migrant children from _x000D_
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have been apprehended at _x000D_
the U.S. border. They are a particularly tragic subset of the _x000D_
approximately 3 million migrants from Central America's _x000D_
Northern Triangle that have reached U.S. shores over the past _x000D_
two decades._x000D_
    Four factors are at the root of those migration flows:_x000D_
    First, the weakness of the State. States in the Northern _x000D_
Triangle are very feeble. At just below 16 percent of gross _x000D_
domestic product (GDP), the region's average tax burden is _x000D_
among the lowest in the world. Such fiscal starvation impinges _x000D_
on the ability of the State to mitigate the impact of the very _x000D_
high levels of poverty and inequality that afflict these _x000D_
countries. Also, fiscally weak States have great problems _x000D_
exerting effective control over their territory._x000D_
    Second, corruption. The effects of fiscal weakness are _x000D_
compounded by endemic corruption, notably in Guatemala and _x000D_
Honduras. Relative to the size of the economy, the fraud _x000D_
recently uncovered at Honduras' social security system dwarfs _x000D_
the massive bribery scandal of Brazil's Petrobras by a factor _x000D_
of 20._x000D_
    The state of judicial institutions is a critical factor in _x000D_
explaining these levels of corruption. In all three countries, _x000D_
political interference in judicial and overseeing institutions _x000D_
is rife. The struggle for democracy and development in the _x000D_
Northern Triangle is, above all, a fight for the rule of law, _x000D_
for accountability and against all forms of impunity._x000D_
    Third, economic vulnerability. For the majority of migrants _x000D_
from Northern Central America, economic reasons underlie the _x000D_
decision to leave their countries. Despite the efforts made by _x000D_
these countries to open up their economies, they appear unable _x000D_
to generate the kind of growth that could make a real dent in _x000D_
their poverty levels. Over the past decade, per capita income _x000D_
growth in all three countries has been mediocre at best. Given _x000D_
their distributional problems, it is unsurprising that the _x000D_
majority of the population remains mired in poverty or economic _x000D_
vulnerability. Today remittances contribute 10 percent of GDP _x000D_
in Guatemala, nearly 17 percent in El Salvador, and over 18 _x000D_
percent in Honduras. The truth is that it is remittances from _x000D_
migrants that keep these economies afloat._x000D_
    Fourth, crime and violence. The most pressing challenge _x000D_
faced by the Northern Triangle concerns high levels of crime. _x000D_
Last year, Honduras alone had more homicides than the 28 member _x000D_
States of the European Union combined."
2926071,2926070,2926072,19241,16,"    Sure. Last year, Honduras alone had more _x000D_
homicides than the 28 member States of the European Union _x000D_
combined. Violence levels in Northern Central America cannot be _x000D_
understood but in terms of the pervasive presence of organized _x000D_
crime, particularly drug trafficking._x000D_
    All these mythologies are not just complex, but are deeply _x000D_
intertwined. None of this can be corrected by foreign _x000D_
assistance alone, yet none of this will be corrected without _x000D_
foreign assistance. Let me suggest a few ways in which the _x000D_
United States could play a constructive role._x000D_
    One, fund generously the Alliance for Prosperity in the _x000D_
Northern Triangle. The alliance is a timely and well-conceived _x000D_
program. It embodies the long-term and integral approach that _x000D_
is essential to bring about structural change and hopefully _x000D_
contain migratory flows. It would be a loss if the program were _x000D_
to shed its holistic conception and wind up as yet another _x000D_
narrow counternarcotics effort._x000D_
    Two, support Guatemala's International Commission Against _x000D_
Impunity (CICIG) and expand it. The United States played no _x000D_
small part in the creation of CICIG. You should be commended _x000D_
for that. Even before its crucial role in the investigation _x000D_
that led to the resignation of President Otto Perez Molina, the _x000D_
Commission had proved a very valuable resource for Guatemala. _x000D_
The United States continued support for CICIG is vital for the _x000D_
whole region. Its experience provides a blueprint for similar _x000D_
bodies that could and should be adopted in other countries, _x000D_
certainly Honduras._x000D_
    Three, insist on structural reforms. There are clear limits _x000D_
to what even a generous and soundly conceived program of _x000D_
foreign assistance can achieve in Northern Central America. It _x000D_
is a legitimate question whether the United States will find in _x000D_
the region's political elites suitable partners to make this _x000D_
effort worthwhile. The case of Perez Molina and the popular _x000D_
mobilization against corruption in Honduras suggest that some _x000D_
of the best partners are to be found in the region's civil _x000D_
societies. One can also point to brave, isolated reformers that _x000D_
defy impossible odds to bring about institutional change in all _x000D_
three countries. Identifying those champions of reform is _x000D_
difficult but possible._x000D_
    I will submit that the United States can gauge the _x000D_
seriousness of political partners in the region according to _x000D_
two criteria: first, their readiness to push for robust and _x000D_
progressive tax systems; and, second, their sincerity about _x000D_
introducing checks and balances and promoting judicial _x000D_
independence. Hence, attempts to pack the supreme court or to _x000D_
introduce indefinite reelection, for instance, ought to be _x000D_
taken for what they are: preludes to the corruption, power _x000D_
abuse, and impunity that have sadly been the historical norm in _x000D_
much of Central America._x000D_
    Introducing progressive tax reform and real checks and _x000D_
balances on are the crux of the matter. If the United States is _x000D_
serious about helping the Northern Triangle, it should not be _x000D_
shy about demanding those structural changes._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

2926073,2926072,2926074,19241,16,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper, for the invitation. Good morning, everybody._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Wood appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 1656._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As you just said, I am here to talk about Mexico's Programa _x000D_
Frontera Sur, the Southern Border Program, based on two recent _x000D_
study tours that the Wilson Center has taken to the border with _x000D_
Guatemala and Belize, and there are two main messages I would _x000D_
like to leave with you today:_x000D_
    One, the Southern Border Program is very much a work in _x000D_
progress, but it is having an impact in multiple ways that are _x000D_
of enormous interest to the United States' homeland security._x000D_
    And, second, based upon what Mexico is attempting to do on _x000D_
its Southern Border, migrant roots are changing as migrants and _x000D_
smugglers learn how to get around Mexican Government controls._x000D_
    Let me begin by just talking about the border a little bit _x000D_
between Mexico and Guatemala. The map here--which, of course, _x000D_
is too small for you to see, but I think you have a copy of it _x000D_
somewhere--between Mexico and Guatemala there are eight formal _x000D_
crossing points, so eight border crossings where you can cross _x000D_
legally between the two countries. And there are identified by _x000D_
the Mexican Government 57 informal crossing points where people _x000D_
regularly cross back and forth, often for entirely innocent _x000D_
reasons of doing some shopping for the Sunday lunch, for _x000D_
example, or buying basics for their house._x000D_
    The border region is, of course, a divers region, difficult _x000D_
terrain, rivers, forest, hills, and also urban areas. There is _x000D_
an active border life. As I said, people cross regularly, _x000D_
formally and informally, to engage in commerce, visits, et _x000D_
cetera. And local communities are very wary of a thickening of _x000D_
the Guatemala-Mexico-Belize border. And, in fact, there have _x000D_
been examples, cases of protests from local communities when _x000D_
efforts have been made to try to restrict traffic. And Mexican _x000D_
Government officials have told us that that is actually one of _x000D_
the issues they are struggling with._x000D_
    Mexico's interest in its Southern Border is, of course, not _x000D_
new. It really began in recent times, in the mid-2000s, a _x000D_
growing awareness of the importance of the Southern Border for _x000D_
organized crime and for the question of transmigration. And, of _x000D_
course, there have been many criticisms from Mexican civil _x000D_
society of Mexico's record of protecting Central American _x000D_
migrants._x000D_
    The Mexico Comision Internacional de Limites Y Aguas--the _x000D_
Mexican international commission for boundaries and waters--has _x000D_
done impressive work in actually mapping the border and _x000D_
understanding the reality, the day-to-day reality there. They _x000D_
were of enormous help to us when we actually conducted our _x000D_
tour._x000D_
    And, in fact, just to give you an idea of where we began _x000D_
with all of this, it is only in the last decade that the border _x000D_
itself between Mexico and Guatemala has been adequately _x000D_
demarcated so that you actually can now visit the actual _x000D_
borderline and know when you are crossing over the territory _x000D_
from one country to another. That is the starting point. So _x000D_
there is a lot of work to be done there._x000D_
    The Southern Border Program in Mexico has existed for a _x000D_
number of years, but it was reinvigorated under the current _x000D_
presidency of Enrique Pena Nieto. The program has two official _x000D_
objectives: one, to protect migrants who enter Mexico; two, to _x000D_
manage the ports of entry in a way that promotes the security _x000D_
and prosperity of the region. It aims to do this in five ways: _x000D_
one, through bringing about regular and orderly migration; two, _x000D_
improvements to infrastructure for border security and _x000D_
migration; three, protecting migrants; four, regional shared _x000D_
responsibility; and, five, interagency coordination. We saw _x000D_
elements of all of those things on our tours._x000D_
    The most important thing that I would say we saw there was _x000D_
the impressive investment in facilities, procedures, and _x000D_
controls that the Mexican Government has put in place. They _x000D_
have put in place a regional visitor visa program and a _x000D_
visiting border worker program, which is allowing people to _x000D_
actually cross over legally in a formal fashion to visit _x000D_
southern Mexico from Guatemala and Belize. And I have the _x000D_
numbers of those visa permits if you need them._x000D_
    This attempt to provide a formal way for Guatemalans and _x000D_
Belizeans to enter Mexico is very important. The facilities at _x000D_
the border are multimodal. You see the migration agency, the _x000D_
military, customs, health, agriculture, everybody is actually _x000D_
there. This means that there is a growing presence of the _x000D_
Mexican State in the Southern Border region which has not been _x000D_
there before._x000D_
    What are the challenges that remain? Well, it is an _x000D_
impressive attempt to establish some sense of order and to _x000D_
raise the visibility of the Mexican State in the south. And in _x000D_
many ways, it is positive for local communities in terms of _x000D_
security. However, it is clear that the flows are not going to _x000D_
diminish as long as conditions in Central America continue to _x000D_
be as harsh as they are. Migrants learn and migrants adapt, and _x000D_
we saw multiple examples of migrant routes going around Mexican _x000D_
attempts to control. So it is a problem of abuses, many _x000D_
criticisms of Mexico's treatment of migrants. We saw evidence _x000D_
on both sides of that that, in fact, there are actually some _x000D_
respectable conditions in detention centers in southern Mexico. _x000D_
But we also heard stories that told an opposite story._x000D_
    And, last, on the question of regional cooperation, Mexico _x000D_
is going to face a very big challenge in evolving its regional _x000D_
cooperation with countries like Guatemala simply because of the _x000D_
lack of capacity in their counterpart. Interestingly enough, _x000D_
military cooperation between Mexico and Guatemala has advanced _x000D_
very rapidly and there is good understanding. Working with the _x000D_
rest of the government agencies has been much more challenging._x000D_
    Thank you very much."

    Mr. Chairman, we are witnessing a humanitarian situation in _x000D_
our hemisphere in which vulnerable children and families are _x000D_
fleeing for their lives in search of protection. If we cannot _x000D_
respond justly and humanely to this challenge in our own _x000D_
backyard, then we relinquish our moral leadership and influence _x000D_
globally, where much greater crises are being experienced._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Bishops sent a delegation led by _x000D_
myself to Central America to assess the situation there and _x000D_
were among the first groups to warn of a possible outflow of _x000D_
children and families fleeing from that region._x000D_
    Since then, the violence in the Northern Triangle region of _x000D_
Central America has only worsened. El Salvador, victim of a new _x000D_
gang war, now rivals Honduras as the Nation with the highest _x000D_
murder rate in the world. A recent study by the United Nations _x000D_
(U.N.) determined that more than 6 in 10 of those who arrived _x000D_
at our borders or were leaving had legitimate asylum claims._x000D_
    I would like to recall with you a very distinguished _x000D_
visitor who graced these hallowed halls just last month. In his _x000D_
speech to Congress, Pope Francis urged us to show compassion to _x000D_
those fleeing to our land, and I quote: ``We must not be taken _x000D_
by their numbers but, rather, as persons, seeing their faces _x000D_
and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we _x000D_
can to their situation.''_x000D_
    We should listen to the story of Maria, a 14-year-old from _x000D_
El Salvador who was kidnapped by a gang member and held _x000D_
captive, raped, and drugged. She managed to escape and fled to _x000D_
the United States._x000D_
    We should listen to the story of Manuel, a 17-year-old boy _x000D_
who was severely beaten by gang members and threatened with _x000D_
death if he did not join the gang. He escaped to the United _x000D_
States and was granted a Trafficking Victims eligibility letter _x000D_
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit their stories and _x000D_
those of other children for the record.\1\_x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    While the number of children and families arriving at our _x000D_
border has dropped in this past fiscal year by 40 percent, that _x000D_
does not mean that the number of persons fleeing Central _x000D_
America has dropped, as we have noted. Instead, it means that _x000D_
they are fleeing to neighboring countries or, worse, are being _x000D_
intercepted by Mexican authorities at our behest and sent back _x000D_
to danger, without proper screening and protection mechanisms._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, according to the Migration Policy Institute, _x000D_
the Mexican Government has returned 70 percent more migrants, _x000D_
mostly women and children, back to the Northern Triangle over _x000D_
the past fiscal year ending September 30. They have returned _x000D_
six times more children than at this time last year. We have _x000D_
transferred the authority--or the responsibility for this _x000D_
crisis to others, and in so doing perhaps we have abdicated our _x000D_
own._x000D_
    But as we have heard, children and families continue to _x000D_
arrive at our Southern Border, and more recently we have seen a _x000D_
spike in their numbers. By increasing interdiction efforts, we _x000D_
have driven them into the hand of more sophisticated smugglers _x000D_
who are charging them $7,000 and more per trip and are finding _x000D_
ways to circumvent enforcement efforts using private cars and _x000D_
bribes along the way._x000D_
    However, Mr. Chairman, there are more serious humanitarian _x000D_
consequences to this interdiction policy. According to the _x000D_
Mexican Human Rights Commission, abuse of migrants by _x000D_
enforcement personnel has increased by 40 percent over the past _x000D_
year, including physical and sexual assault._x000D_
    There have also been reports that migrants sent back to _x000D_
their countries have been killed with at least 90 such deaths _x000D_
documented over the past year and a half._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, if we export enforcement, we must also export _x000D_
protection._x000D_
    As my testimony details, we recommend that Congress and the _x000D_
administration, No. 1, approve and increase the $1 billion _x000D_
administration request for aid to Central America, directing _x000D_
assistance to youth development and reintegration programs._x000D_
    No. 2, that we halt our punitive deterrence strategy and _x000D_
instill a regional protection system based on the best interest _x000D_
determinations for children._x000D_
    Third, that we improve the Central American Minors (CAM), _x000D_
program._x000D_
    And, fourth, that we end family detention and replace it _x000D_
with community-based alternative to detention programs._x000D_
    Fifth, that we ultimately get comprehensive immigration _x000D_
reform._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to sum up the current situation _x000D_
with an analogy. Our current enforcement posture toward _x000D_
children and families fleeing the violence in Central America _x000D_
is akin to firemen arriving at a house fire and locking the _x000D_
doors. Instead of locking the doors, Mr. Chairman, we must put _x000D_
out the fire and rescue those inside._x000D_
    As I conclude, perhaps we could recall our Holy Father's _x000D_
words during his visit. He also invoked a basic rule of life _x000D_
that should guide all of our actions: the Golden Rule. He _x000D_
reminded us that it is not only right but in our long-term best _x000D_
interest to practice that wise dictum. As he explained, ``In a _x000D_
word, if we want security, let us give security. If we want _x000D_
life, let us give life. If we want opportunity, let us give _x000D_
opportunity. The yardstick we use for others will be the _x000D_
yardstick which will be used for us.''_x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, I pray that time and history will conclude _x000D_
that we honored this rule in meeting this humanitarian _x000D_
challenge. Thank you."
2926075,2926074,2926076,19241,16,"    Thank you, Bishop._x000D_
    I will start with the questioning. Again, there is no doubt _x000D_
about the fact that this is an enormous problem, and as we _x000D_
talked about, one of the root causes is our insatiable demand _x000D_
for drugs, the lack of opportunity in Central America, the _x000D_
violence being driven a lot because of the drug cartels, that _x000D_
type of thing._x000D_
    The question always is, well, OK, what is an achievable _x000D_
goal here? I do not think it is good for Central America that _x000D_
those individuals that actually want to seek opportunity flow _x000D_
out of the country. I think the goal of our policy should be to _x000D_
stop the flow--again, understanding how complex that is, if you _x000D_
could wave a magic wand and, make Central America corruption-_x000D_
free so they actually had a rule of law, so that their _x000D_
economies could actually grow, that is what we are trying to _x000D_
achieve. And the hard questions are, in terms of aid programs, _x000D_
are we just pouring money down a rat hole? Is there any chance _x000D_
that money spent in Central America will be utilized _x000D_
effectively? So if we put the money in there, what kind of _x000D_
controls do we have?_x000D_
    Ms. Gianopoulos, I would like to talk to you in terms of _x000D_
the GAO study because I think one thing I really want you to _x000D_
comment on, the reality of the situation, regardless of what _x000D_
Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA), what those _x000D_
memorandums say, regardless of what our marketing programs are _x000D_
in terms of the danger of the journey, and the Bishop spoke _x000D_
very eloquently about the harm, I mean, the migrants are being _x000D_
abused. It is a dangerous journey. But the reality is if those _x000D_
children, if those families can get into America, they are _x000D_
staying. Since 2009, less than 7 percent have actually been _x000D_
sent back. So by the use of social media, those that are here _x000D_
are communicating back into Central America, so it is a gamble _x000D_
that pays off._x000D_
    Now, some people are abused along the journey. That is a _x000D_
tragedy. But the bottom line is they were willing to take that _x000D_
dangerous journey because they are able to stay here. Can you _x000D_
just expand on exactly how they are using social media?"
2926076,2926075,2926077,19241,16,"    Sure. When we traveled to the region, we _x000D_
heard from a number of different children, from U.S. officials _x000D_
in Guatemala and El Salvador that the use of social media has _x000D_
absolutely exploded, not just for the families of the children _x000D_
who are making the journey, but also for the coyotes, that they _x000D_
are actually advertising their immigration services on various _x000D_
social media and getting the word out that way as to what the _x000D_
options are for the various families who want their children, _x000D_
or the families themselves, to make that trek._x000D_
    So the social media cannot be ignored as a major push _x000D_
factor in getting families to actually consider taking all of _x000D_
these risks and sending their children or themselves to the _x000D_
United States."
2926077,2926076,2926078,19241,16,"    Mr. Casas-Zamora, you talked about the _x000D_
rule of law. Can you expand on that a little bit in terms of _x000D_
how crucial that is? Let us face it. You are not going to get _x000D_
investment to grow an economy unless you have some stability in _x000D_
terms of the rule of law, lack of corruption. How far are we _x000D_
away from having low enough levels of corruption and a strong _x000D_
enough rule of law to actually provide the type of economic _x000D_
activity, to provide the opportunities that is admittedly _x000D_
lacking in Central America?"
2926078,2926077,2926079,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. The short answer is _x000D_
very far from that. And the question here is, What is to be _x000D_
done? And my short answer to that would be that there are basic _x000D_
things that need to be put in place before we go on to more _x000D_
sophisticated policies or proposals._x000D_
    The most basic thing that needs to be in place if these _x000D_
countries are going to be serious about corruption--but also _x000D_
about the impunity that comes with the problems concerning _x000D_
citizen security. I mean, the most basic thing is to protect _x000D_
judicial independence, and to protect the autonomy of _x000D_
overseeing institutions such as the General Accounting Office, _x000D_
the ombudsman, all the institutions that are meant to control _x000D_
the exercise of power. Those institutions are in terrible shape _x000D_
in Central America, and my contention would be that one of the _x000D_
ways in which one can gauge the seriousness of your partners in _x000D_
Central America is by the willingness that they are willing to _x000D_
display in doing those basic things. Then we can go on to other _x000D_
things."
2926079,2926078,2926080,19241,16,"    Basically I would interpret your remarks, _x000D_
any kind of aid would have to have enormous strings, very _x000D_
strong strings attached to it so that we do not just waste the _x000D_
money."
2926080,2926079,2926081,19241,16,    Very much so.
2926081,2926080,2926082,19241,16,"    Dr. Wood, you talked about the increased _x000D_
effort on the part of Mexico to secure their Southern Border. _x000D_
Can you just tell me why they are doing it?"
2926082,2926081,2926083,19241,16,"    Yes, first, let me just make one quick comment on _x000D_
the last question."
2926083,2926082,2926084,19241,16,    Sure.
2926084,2926083,2926085,19241,16,"    I think that we are witnessing right now _x000D_
throughout Latin America a civil society awakening over the _x000D_
question of corruption, and that is something that we should _x000D_
celebrate and we should reinforce. I think working only with _x000D_
governments is the wrong way to go. We need to be reinforcing _x000D_
what civil societies throughout the region are doing. We have _x000D_
seen it in Guatemala. We have seen it in Brazil. I think that _x000D_
is one thing that we could do._x000D_
    Why is the Mexican Government engaging in their Programa _x000D_
Frontera Sur? Well, first of all, this was a preexisting _x000D_
program that had never really had the investment that it _x000D_
required to make it effective. So the question is: Why are they _x000D_
actually investing in it now? Partly it is in reaction to _x000D_
pressure from the United States to try to bring about some _x000D_
order for the migration flows northwards. But there is also _x000D_
very much a Mexican Government interest in this. I think there _x000D_
is a crossover, a very clear crossover, between what we are _x000D_
seeing on trying to control migration flows and trying to _x000D_
control organized crime on Mexico's Southern Border._x000D_
    When you visit these facilities, both border facilities and _x000D_
facilities that are remote from the border inland, the presence _x000D_
of not only migracion but also the military, the police, _x000D_
health, et cetera, those multimodal interagency facilities are _x000D_
designed to establish the presence of the Mexican State in a _x000D_
territory where it was not really visible before._x000D_
    This means that the costs of moving through southern Mexico _x000D_
have been increased, not just for migrants but for organized _x000D_
crime as well. It does not mean they do not adapt. Of course _x000D_
they do. But it raises the cost, and it makes it much more _x000D_
complex for them to do that."
2926085,2926084,2926086,19241,16,"    So the good news is really there is _x000D_
mutual benefit to the United States as well as Mexico for a _x000D_
continued effort to secure the Mexican border there."
2926086,2926085,2926087,19241,16,"    There are definitely mutual benefits in terms of _x000D_
homeland security."
2926087,2926086,2926088,19241,16,"    Agent Cabrera, I do want you to talk a _x000D_
little bit more about--we toured the Southern Border with you--_x000D_
the use of the economic immigrants for diversion for drugs. Can _x000D_
you just expand on that a little bit more? Because I thought _x000D_
that was pretty telling, that when you really thought about it, _x000D_
these children, these families could just walk across the _x000D_
bridge and turn themselves in, and, they would be processed the _x000D_
exact same way, but that is not what happens. They actually do _x000D_
make the more dangerous trip across the river. Just describe _x000D_
some of those stories that you described at the border with us."
2926088,2926087,2926089,19241,16,    How often does that happen?
2926089,2926088,2926090,19241,16,"    You have multiple groups every night, _x000D_
every day?"
2926090,2926089,2926091,19241,16,"    So it is extremely effective diversion _x000D_
for their drug trafficking."
2926091,2926090,2926092,19241,16,"    And potentially the higher value--you _x000D_
mentioned the Middle Eastern----"
2926092,2926091,2926093,19241,16,    Right.
2926093,2926092,2926094,19241,16,"    Thank you. And we have held hearings--and _x000D_
we are going to have more hearings--just on the tragedy of _x000D_
heroin addiction and deaths here in America coming through the _x000D_
Southern Border. Senator Carper."
2926094,2926093,2926095,19241,16,    Thank you----
2926095,2926094,2926096,19241,16,"    That is me, hailing from Central America."
2926096,2926095,2926097,19241,16,    Costa Rica.
2926097,2926096,2926098,19241,16,"    Thanks. Glad to hear that._x000D_
    I think the single most important lesson that one can draw _x000D_
from Plan Colombia and similar experiences is that unless there _x000D_
is real serious buy-in from the political elite in the country, _x000D_
very little of this will have any success. The lion's share of _x000D_
transforming these countries, of reforming and, establishing _x000D_
real structures, the rule of law, and accountability, really _x000D_
falls on the shoulders of those countries. Unless they get _x000D_
serious about that, no amount of foreign assistance will do the _x000D_
trick."
2926098,2926097,2926099,19241,16,"    Yes, and it is kind of in response to your _x000D_
previous question. If you look at what the aid is going to _x000D_
Mexico right now through the Merida Initiative, there is all _x000D_
the traditional stuff, sort of, aiding the military, law _x000D_
enforcement agencies, et cetera. But one of the most _x000D_
interesting aspects is actually the concept of building _x000D_
resilient communities, and this is working with government at _x000D_
the three levels--Federal, State, and local--working with the _x000D_
private sector, working with civil society to really try to _x000D_
help communities to bounce back after violence has broken out. _x000D_
And I would say that some of these community-based approaches _x000D_
at the local level really do provide an opportunity, not to _x000D_
stop the violence but really once a community or a nation has _x000D_
taken the decision to act upon it, to help them recover._x000D_
    So I would say the community-based approaches are going to _x000D_
be crucial in improving conditions."
2926099,2926098,2926100,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. I have no doubt that _x000D_
helping rebuild law enforcement institutions in these countries _x000D_
should be one of the priorities of the alliance. It should not _x000D_
be only that, but that has to be at the center. And my _x000D_
impression is that foreign assistance in this field can only _x000D_
hope to bring about visible changes if it picks a few urgent _x000D_
institutional programs that can have a catalytic effect in the _x000D_
transformation of the image and the efficacy of law enforcement _x000D_
bodies--things like improving internal control and _x000D_
anticorruption units within law enforcement bodies; adopting _x000D_
modern information technologies (IT), and that means from _x000D_
regular victimization surveys to the kind of--the CompStat kind _x000D_
of system for data gathering; and to have those information _x000D_
technologies and adopt them as part of the policymaking _x000D_
process; creating vetted units to handle complex multinational _x000D_
investigations; improving investigation and prosecutorial _x000D_
capacities with regards to complex financial crimes; and _x000D_
support CICIG."
2926100,2926099,2926101,19241,16,"    It is the UN-sponsored International _x000D_
Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala that, on balance, has _x000D_
been extraordinarily successful."
2926101,2926100,2926102,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. And let us _x000D_
hope they succeed. Senator McCaskill."
2926102,2926101,2926103,19241,16,"    Without objection, so ordered._x000D_
    Did you have questions for--this is a hearing on _x000D_
unaccompanied children, so----"
2926103,2926102,2926104,19241,16,"    I will say, by the way, I appreciated us _x000D_
working together on our investigation of Charles Edwards. _x000D_
Obviously, that investigation was, quite honestly, pushed when _x000D_
we were in the minority. And the reason those things came to _x000D_
light, those revelations, was because of the transparency of _x000D_
the investigation. We are here with GAO, we are here with this _x000D_
Committee deals with Inspector Generals. We have seen the _x000D_
problem of not being transparent, which is exactly how Charles _x000D_
Edwards got in trouble. We saw 140 inspections, reports on _x000D_
inspections, investigations of the Inspector General Office _x000D_
within the Veterans Administration (VA), creating real problems _x000D_
in the VA. So this Committee is all about transparency. We have _x000D_
certainly been working with the minority staff on these things, _x000D_
and they have been aware of the letters we are sending. We have _x000D_
been making many letters public so that we have that type of _x000D_
transparency to put pressure on the political process and on _x000D_
the agencies to comply with, for example, our subpoenas and _x000D_
those types of things._x000D_
    So if you are truly serious about working with me, I think _x000D_
you probably would have first talked to me privately as opposed _x000D_
to politicizing this in a hearing on unaccompanied children, a _x000D_
really serious problem. But I think you had a couple minutes, _x000D_
if you would like to ask questions here as opposed to----"
2926104,2926103,2926105,19241,16,    Do you have questions for the witnesses?
2926105,2926104,2926106,19241,16,    OK.
2926106,2926105,2926107,19241,16,"    The issues at stake here--and, again, _x000D_
this is very unfortunate that you have politicized this _x000D_
important hearing here. The issues at stake involve national _x000D_
security issues. We need to assume, because in other hearings _x000D_
we have had in this Committee on cybersecurity, we have to _x000D_
assume that everything that was on Secretary Clinton's email is _x000D_
in the hands of our enemies. The purpose of my involvement in _x000D_
this, this is my responsibility. This Committee is charged with _x000D_
national security processes and Federal records. It is the _x000D_
responsibility of this Committee._x000D_
    I think it is also the responsibility of this Committee to _x000D_
put pressure on the agencies to make sure that they conduct a _x000D_
thorough investigation so that we can, if possible, recover _x000D_
every email--even those deleted that were supposedly personal, _x000D_
because we need to find out what classified information might _x000D_
be on those emails that now may be in the hands of our enemy or _x000D_
enemies so that we can mitigate any kind of harm. This is a _x000D_
very serious effort on the part of this Committee. It is _x000D_
unfortunate that Senator McCaskill had to politicize this _x000D_
particular hearing on a very serious problem in and of its own _x000D_
self._x000D_
    But, again, I am happy to discuss this. Again, we have had _x000D_
a good working relationship, as you are aware of the fact. Our _x000D_
staffs have been working together. We have not sent out a _x000D_
letter that you have not reviewed first or your staff has not _x000D_
reviewed. But, again, I want to move on to Senator Peters."
2926107,2926106,2926108,19241,16,"    I am all about transparency. Senator _x000D_
Peters."
2926108,2926107,2926109,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. When we visited the _x000D_
countries, as well as when we spoke with U.S. agency officials _x000D_
here, we learned about a variety of different information _x000D_
campaigns that both DHS and the State Department have engaged _x000D_
in over the past few years to try to counter some of the _x000D_
misinformation that the coyotes have put out there with regard _x000D_
to the dangers of the journey and what is involved and what the _x000D_
immigration policy actually is here in the United States and _x000D_
what the children and the families would be eligible for once _x000D_
they arrived, if they chose to make that journey._x000D_
    Our recommendations in our report specifically focus on the _x000D_
evaluations that are necessary to ensure that the resources _x000D_
being put into these campaigns are meaningful and useful and _x000D_
are done at the right times._x000D_
    For example, as I mentioned in my oral statement, in 2013 _x000D_
the public information campaign that was put out there was done _x000D_
in April, which was an appropriate time since it was aligned _x000D_
with the major surge for the year. Or that was what was _x000D_
anticipated. However, in 2014 that effort, that information _x000D_
campaign, actually took place starting in June, which was after _x000D_
the major surge for that year. So the usefulness or the _x000D_
efficacy of that program was brought into question. And then _x000D_
DHS and State did not even do an evaluation of their _x000D_
information campaigns that year, so they did not even know if _x000D_
those campaigns were having any effect or were useful or were _x000D_
using the right format or any of that. So our recommendations _x000D_
were specific to those agencies, and they did agree with those _x000D_
recommendations that in the future they spend some of their _x000D_
resources evaluating the efforts that they have taken and the _x000D_
resources that they have invested to try to counter that _x000D_
misinformation."
2926109,2926108,2926110,19241,16,"    When we heard back from the agencies after _x000D_
we had given them a draft report to review, we understood that _x000D_
DHS was going to engage in an additional campaign, and they do _x000D_
expect to do an evaluation of that campaign as they go forward _x000D_
to see how useful it is. So we can follow up with that _x000D_
afterwards and see how useful that was and if they did do an _x000D_
evaluation. But in July, when we issued our report, they had _x000D_
just started the campaign."
2926110,2926109,2926111,19241,16,"    We would have to get back to you with _x000D_
additional information on that."
2926111,2926110,2926112,19241,16,    Of course.
2926112,2926111,2926113,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. There is a limit to _x000D_
what any foreign actor can do with regards to this. I mean, _x000D_
cleaning up rotten law enforcement institutions is something _x000D_
that the country itself has to do. But the one thing that you _x000D_
can do in a constructive way is to lay out some conditions, and _x000D_
I suppose also, be willing to say something when certain _x000D_
behavior is done by the political elites in this country._x000D_
    I have the impression that if you are serious about _x000D_
establishing the rule of law in any of these countries, the _x000D_
idea of introducing indefinite reelection is probably not a _x000D_
good idea. The idea of packing the supreme court with your _x000D_
acolytes is probably not a good idea._x000D_
    So my humble suggestion is that you measure the seriousness _x000D_
of your partners, of your political partners in Central America _x000D_
by the extent to which they are willing to be serious with _x000D_
regard to judicial independence and the autonomy of overseeing _x000D_
institutions. The rest is really up to them._x000D_
    And the other thing that I would humbly suggest is that _x000D_
some of the programs that I mentioned before that can be done _x000D_
in the area of law enforcement, they should be done on the _x000D_
basis of matching funds from these countries. I am going to be _x000D_
very blunt about this, but I do not think that it is fair, _x000D_
regardless of the level of responsibility that the United _x000D_
States may have on what is happening in Central America--there _x000D_
is some responsibility, but the elites in these countries _x000D_
should not be left off the hook."
2926113,2926112,2926114,19241,16,"    It is very difficult to do it in the _x000D_
abstract, but I think you can identify champions of reform. _x000D_
People on the ground will tell you who is serious about these _x000D_
things, and I can give you a few examples of people that defy _x000D_
impossible odds; not just from civil society but also from _x000D_
within institutions, defying impossible odds has managed to _x000D_
promote change: former Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz in _x000D_
Guatemala, an exceptionally brave woman; police reformer Helen _x000D_
Mack, in Guatemala, another exceptionally brave individual; _x000D_
some of the judges and prosecutors that just recently stood up _x000D_
to President Perez Molina in Guatemala; the judges of the _x000D_
constitutional court in El Salvador that have been willing over _x000D_
the past few years to assert their independence from political _x000D_
power._x000D_
    All those people are champions of reform, and I think they _x000D_
at least deserve the backing of the international community in _x000D_
what they are trying to do, which is change their countries."
2926114,2926113,2926115,19241,16,"    First of all, I would just like to say that in _x000D_
all of these cases--and I know everybody understands this, but _x000D_
there is no silver bullet. I mean, these are complex--there _x000D_
have to be complex solutions, and we have to address it at _x000D_
multiple levels._x000D_
    On your question on civil society, one of the most _x000D_
interesting things I think we have seen in Mexico over the past _x000D_
year or so has been the rise of civil society organizations _x000D_
that are focused on rule of law but in particular on _x000D_
anticorruption issues. And we have seen a number of very well _x000D_
respected think tanks actually doing active work trying to _x000D_
understand what international best practices are in terms of _x000D_
anticorruption and transparency, and they have worked very _x000D_
closely with the government to design the new national _x000D_
anticorruption system._x000D_
    That was brought about because the Mexican Government came _x000D_
under intense pressure from civil society to do so, and they _x000D_
engaged with academic institutions and think tanks and civil _x000D_
society to try to create at least a good legal framework. But _x000D_
that is not enough. What you now need is you need the oversight _x000D_
and the vigilance of civil society and from foreign governments _x000D_
to make sure that that happens._x000D_
    As Kevin just said, it is relatively easy to identify who _x000D_
the reliable local partners are. You just need to spend some _x000D_
time in-country, and the missions, you know, U.S. Government _x000D_
missions in-country, should be able to pick up that information _x000D_
very quickly by talking to universities and to think tanks _x000D_
themselves."
2926115,2926114,2926116,19241,16,"    Can I just say something really quickly? _x000D_
Maybe the takeaway point here is there are people you can work _x000D_
with in Central America, and that is very important. It is not _x000D_
fair just to, throw up our hands in despair and say, well, we _x000D_
are going to waste our money. I think there are good people to _x000D_
work with there. There are not many, but identifying those _x000D_
champions of reform is certainly possible."
2926116,2926115,2926117,19241,16,"    I think the question is can you work with _x000D_
the governments, and it is identifying them. Senator Lankford."
2926117,2926116,2926118,19241,16,"    If I can just jump on this, we visited Belize _x000D_
when we were on our recent tour. We had a visit to border _x000D_
management agency facilities on the Mexico-Belize border. What _x000D_
we learned there was that there is a political will on the part _x000D_
of the Belize Government to actually establish not just order _x000D_
but really to gather data. And these are professionals. They _x000D_
actually do not have huge financial resources behind them, but _x000D_
they are willing to cooperate with their Mexican counterparts._x000D_
    Just to give you one example, there is one point on the _x000D_
border where there are in fact, two Mexican border posts but _x000D_
only one Belize border post. The Belize Government did not want _x000D_
to actually spend to build another border post, which is only a _x000D_
few miles away. So what they did was they worked with the _x000D_
Mexican Government to build a new road that brought both of _x000D_
these Mexican border crossings to the one Belize border _x000D_
management station right there._x000D_
    The highway is walled in on either side, so you cannot sort _x000D_
of jump off it and enter the country illegally in that way. And _x000D_
when you get to the border crossing on the Belize side, they _x000D_
are making an effort to actually gather biometric data on all _x000D_
people coming in and leaving the country._x000D_
    This is a political will question, and what you do not see _x000D_
is you do not see that on the side of the Guatemalan _x000D_
authorities. When you cross over from Mexico into Guatemala, _x000D_
you see very minimal presence of the State and an absence of a _x000D_
will to do anything._x000D_
    I will give you one example there. The Mexican Government _x000D_
paid for an electricity line to go from southern Mexico across _x000D_
the border into Guatemala so the Guatemalan border authorities _x000D_
would have access to electricity rather than burning a dirty _x000D_
diesel generator, as they were doing before. Three years ago, _x000D_
the electricity line was put in place. The Guatemalan _x000D_
Government to date has not paid for the enchufe, the socket to _x000D_
be put in there so the government agencies can actually use _x000D_
that electricity. The Mexican Government is providing that for _x000D_
free. They have done it all. That lack of will and perhaps lack _x000D_
of capacity is one of the crucial elements of it."
2926118,2926117,2926119,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. I would just go back _x000D_
for a second, if you will allow me to go back for a second to _x000D_
the previous question. I think your question hints at something _x000D_
that is crucial to understand here, which is that the reason _x000D_
why these countries are, say, vulnerable to organized crime is _x000D_
not merely an accident of geography. It is not simply due to _x000D_
the fact that they happen to be between the main producer of _x000D_
drugs and the main consumer of drugs. I mean, there is more to _x000D_
that._x000D_
    These countries of the Northern Triangle are vulnerable to _x000D_
organized crime primarily because their States are just so _x000D_
anemic that they are not able in some cases to exert effective _x000D_
control over their territory, which is obviously a boon for _x000D_
crime syndicates._x000D_
    They are vulnerable because their public institutions, _x000D_
which are debilitated by corruption, are incapable of making _x000D_
the investments that would prevent them from having--I mean, _x000D_
one of the tragedies of this story is that these countries have _x000D_
25 percent, 30 percent of their young people that are neither _x000D_
studying nor working."
2926119,2926118,2926120,19241,16,"    And that is a tragedy. I mean, they are _x000D_
vulnerable to organized crime because their law enforcement _x000D_
institutions have all but collapsed. So, I mean, there is more _x000D_
than geography."
2926120,2926119,2926121,19241,16,"    Yes, Senator. I wanted to make two quick _x000D_
comments on the line of questioning that you had over the last _x000D_
few moments._x000D_
    First of all, when we were in-country, a USAID grantee told _x000D_
us they were trying to gather some data on the returnees to the _x000D_
countries at the repatriation centers. This is the _x000D_
International Organization for Migration (IOM). It is one of _x000D_
the grantees who is helping the repatriated folks get back into _x000D_
society and find a person, especially if it is children, to _x000D_
find someone in the country to come and get them and take care _x000D_
of them once they have been returned to one of the Northern _x000D_
Triangle countries._x000D_
    I also wanted to point out--we talked a little bit about _x000D_
the willingness of the individual countries to be partners in _x000D_
some of these efforts. One of the things that we found in _x000D_
Honduras is that there is a State and the Department of Justice _x000D_
(DOJ) effort to try to train prosecutors in order to _x000D_
effectively put some of these folks behind bars or at least get _x000D_
them into a courtroom and prosecute them._x000D_
    There is a program where the Honduran Government is _x000D_
supposed to provide prosecutors that would be available for at _x000D_
least 18 months to not only be trained but also to effectively _x000D_
carry out these duties._x000D_
    When we were in-country, we found that though there has _x000D_
been prosecutors participating in the program prior to our _x000D_
visit, there were no active prosecutors in this program from _x000D_
the Honduran side at the time of our visit. Even though State _x000D_
and DOJ were working together and trying to get this well-_x000D_
intentioned program off the ground, there was nobody to train. _x000D_
So even though we are putting money into these efforts----"
2926121,2926120,2926122,19241,16,"    I can get that information for you, _x000D_
Senator. I do not have it off the top of my head._x000D_
    But some of the information that we got that was very _x000D_
disturbing to us, that even though U.S. agencies are doing _x000D_
their best to make some effort and make some inroads into this _x000D_
big problem, sometimes the lack of sustainability in the _x000D_
country, either by the government or by other factors, is _x000D_
inhibiting our ability to do what we need to do."
2926122,2926121,2926123,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator Lankford._x000D_
    Ms. Gianopoulos, you talked about the marketing efforts on _x000D_
the part of America, talking about, you are not going to be _x000D_
able to stay, it is a dangerous journey, and all those types of _x000D_
things, and the effect of that versus the social media._x000D_
    I recall at least hearing from the government officials _x000D_
down in Central America that they had their own marketing _x000D_
campaign, or at least slogan: ``Hey, these are our kids. These _x000D_
are our children. Let us protect them.''_x000D_
    Was that just a message they were telling us here, or did _x000D_
they actually try and convey that? And, again, the fact that _x000D_
there was nobody showing up for that training, are they serious _x000D_
about that, actually trying to keep their citizens in their _x000D_
country?"
2926123,2926122,2926124,19241,16,"    Well, we saw some of the posters when we _x000D_
visited the repatriation centers. We saw some of the posters, _x000D_
not just those from the U.S. agencies but also from the _x000D_
individual governments themselves trying to deter folks from _x000D_
making that dangerous journey._x000D_
    But we also saw some issues, as I mentioned, with the _x000D_
Honduran Government without the prosecutors available to _x000D_
fulfill their roles in this program. Also, in El Salvador, we _x000D_
heard a lot about the lack of economic opportunity for kids _x000D_
that either they cannot cross gang territory to go to school _x000D_
once they have reached a certain level or else they will, be _x000D_
either conscripted into the gangs or raped or whatever. But we _x000D_
also heard about some good programs that we saw that the U.S. _x000D_
Government is supporting._x000D_
    For example, there was a computer training program in El _x000D_
Salvador that we went to visit, a beautiful room full of _x000D_
computers but there was no computer teacher because the El _x000D_
Salvadoran Government had not provided the computer teacher at _x000D_
the time of our visit back in March. And we did not know, was _x000D_
there someone eventually coming? I mean, certainly we heard _x000D_
that there was an intention of someone there to fulfill their _x000D_
role and be the partner to the U.S. agencies who had provided _x000D_
the infrastructure."
2926124,2926123,2926125,19241,16,"    OK. Again, I am just looking for the _x000D_
willingness of these societies to reform to the point where _x000D_
their citizens actually want to stay in their country._x000D_
    Mr. Casas-Zamora, I think it was in your testimony, you _x000D_
talked about how much of their GDP is actually derived from _x000D_
remittances from America back to Central America. That is a _x000D_
pretty powerful incentive to have more people leave, take _x000D_
advantage of the wage differential, take advantage of this line _x000D_
of opportunity to fund their economy. Can you speak a little _x000D_
bit more to that?"
2926125,2926124,2926126,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. That is one of the _x000D_
crucial questions here. It is a powerful incentive. I mean, the _x000D_
only way to counter that is to generate alternative sources of _x000D_
opportunity in the country. And to tell you the truth, that is _x000D_
not easy."
2926126,2926125,2926127,19241,16,"    Well, that requires the rule of law. Let _x000D_
me just ask you a macro question here. How many people in the _x000D_
world do you think want to come to the United States? Just off _x000D_
the top of your head, just go right down, how many people _x000D_
throughout the world? What is the population now? More than 7 _x000D_
billion people?"
2926127,2926126,2926128,19241,16,"    Despite the fact that I was a math major _x000D_
in college, I am not sure I could give you a number."
2926128,2926127,2926129,19241,16,"    It is a lot, isn't it? I mean, that is my _x000D_
point."
2926129,2926128,2926130,19241,16,"    I mean, I cannot possibly for the life of _x000D_
me answer that question, but I will give you----"
2926130,2926129,2926131,19241,16,"    I was not expecting an accurate answer. _x000D_
It was a rhetorical point."
2926131,2926130,2926132,19241,16,"    But I will give you a number that really _x000D_
made my jaw fall to the floor a couple of days ago. A recent _x000D_
opinion poll in Honduras said or found that 63 percent of _x000D_
Hondurans are willing to leave their country if given the _x000D_
chance to. So that in itself is a very powerful number."
2926132,2926131,2926133,19241,16,"    Again, that is not a good State of _x000D_
affairs. It is simply not. Dr. Wood."
2926133,2926132,2926134,19241,16,"    Yes, the question is an interesting one, but I _x000D_
would say that if you gave those same people who want to come _x000D_
to the United States the chance to stay in their own country, _x000D_
many of them would choose that instead--under the right _x000D_
conditions."
2926134,2926133,2926135,19241,16,"    So that is the gold policy. Stop the _x000D_
flow, but the way you have to stop the flow is you do need to _x000D_
stop incentivizing people to come here."
2926135,2926134,2926136,19241,16,    But look at what has happened in the case of----
2926136,2926135,2926137,19241,16,"    We need to figure out some way to provide _x000D_
opportunities, and, unfortunately, without a rule of law, with _x000D_
the corruption that is pretty endemic in these nations right _x000D_
now, it is going to be difficult, which kind of gets me to my _x000D_
next question in terms of nongovernmental organizations. I will _x000D_
go to you, Bishop. I have a great deal of respect for the _x000D_
Catholic Church. I am a Missouri Synod Lutheran, worked hard, _x000D_
helping the Catholic school system in Oshkosh to survive to the _x000D_
point were I was actually on the Finance Council of the Diocese _x000D_
of Green Bay. I love what the Catholic Church does in terms of _x000D_
your charities and globally._x000D_
    Talk to me about the ability of the Non-governmental _x000D_
organizations (NGOs), Catholic Charities, in order to _x000D_
effectively operate without influence, without corruption from _x000D_
those governments. How effective can they be? And can we _x000D_
strengthen their hand in those countries?_x000D_
    Rev. Seitz. I think that is part of the answer to these _x000D_
difficult problems, is public-private partnerships down there, _x000D_
because some of the agencies that are least subject to _x000D_
influence by the forces of corruption are church agencies, for _x000D_
instance, and other NGO's. We are working very hard in these _x000D_
countries through Catholic Relief Services, for instance. We _x000D_
have a program called ``Youth Builders'' that tries to provide _x000D_
skills to these young people and, more important than that, _x000D_
hope that gives them a way to see some future and helps to _x000D_
reintegrate those who are returned._x000D_
    I think one of the most effective programs that we have _x000D_
going is not real visible, but it is the youth programs that _x000D_
every single Catholic parish does in these countries. They have _x000D_
some incredible youth ministry going on. I think there might be _x000D_
some way to connect with these organizations and other NGO's in _x000D_
order to provide a safer----"
2926137,2926136,2926138,19241,16,"    Part of my point is I am trying to point _x000D_
out that Catch-22. I mean, the very people that are leaving the _x000D_
country are the very people those countries need to stay in the _x000D_
country to make it an acceptable society._x000D_
    Rev. Seitz. They are losing their best and brightest."
2926138,2926137,2926139,19241,16,"    Yes, and that is tragic._x000D_
    Dr. Wood, do you want to speak to those NGO's and what the _x000D_
prospects are of them working effectively within those corrupt _x000D_
systems?"
2926139,2926138,2926140,19241,16,"    Yes. I think that what we are seeing is--we are _x000D_
in the middle of a learning process right now about how society _x000D_
can hold government accountable. And there is an interesting _x000D_
process that we are seeing where governments are being forced, _x000D_
partly because of civil society, partly because of _x000D_
international media attention, partly because of foreign _x000D_
investors--and I would make that point strongly. What we have _x000D_
in the United States with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, _x000D_
U.K. Bribery Act in great Britain, those are very important _x000D_
international norms that can have a big impact._x000D_
    I have just been witness to the Mexican energy reforms, oil _x000D_
auctions. What they have done there in terms of transparency is _x000D_
extraordinary. Every single step of the way in the contract, in _x000D_
the bidding process, is exposed to sunlight, as it were. You _x000D_
can literally--when they announce the bids, the bid is there on _x000D_
camera, written and signed by the company concerned. It is _x000D_
possible to do these things. The technology exists. What you _x000D_
need to have is you need to force governments to actually have _x000D_
the will to do that."
2926140,2926139,2926141,19241,16,"    By the way, I do appreciate your use of _x000D_
the word ``transparency.'' We were using it in a different _x000D_
context earlier. Mr. Casas-Zamora."
2926141,2926140,2926142,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. This is really the _x000D_
crux of the matter. The paradox that you alluded to is really _x000D_
central. I mean, I think we have to be aware of the risk, the _x000D_
real risk that the economic future of the Northern Triangle _x000D_
ends up hinging on the ability to continue exporting its young _x000D_
people. And that would be enormously sad because truly, as I _x000D_
see it today, in the absence of a dramatic change of heart by _x000D_
the political and economic elites, these countries will have to _x000D_
give up their best hope for the future in order to have any _x000D_
kind of future. And there are no easy ways to prevent this, but _x000D_
I think the question of economic opportunity is really at the _x000D_
heart of this."
2926142,2926141,2926143,19241,16,"    First of all, my manufacturing background _x000D_
forces me to go to root cause and acknowledge those realities. _x000D_
And it may be counterintuitive, but probably the most _x000D_
compassionate thing we can do--and, again, the goal we should _x000D_
be achieving is to stop the flow because it is--in the long _x000D_
term, it is the most compassionate, it is the best thing to do. _x000D_
To have those countries empty 60-some percent of the _x000D_
populations, on a compassionate basis, flowing to the United _x000D_
States, that would not be good for those countries long term._x000D_
    So, again, I am just trying to look at that overall macro _x000D_
point that somehow--and it is extremely difficult--somehow we _x000D_
have to try and get those societies to succeed and recognize _x000D_
all the problems._x000D_
    Bishop, I will let you have the last word before I turn it _x000D_
over to Senator Carper._x000D_
    Rev. Seitz. I am glad you are looking at the macro issues. _x000D_
I think we need to. But we also need to look at the root causes _x000D_
if we are going to deal with the macro. We cannot simply say, _x000D_
well, for this overarching goal we have to send children back _x000D_
without due process, without representation, back into _x000D_
situations that they are fleeing from, fleeing for their lives. _x000D_
And that seem very clear to us that is exactly what is _x000D_
happening."
2926143,2926142,2926144,19241,16,"    I think that is when we start talking _x000D_
about where should aid flow. Maybe it should be flowing into _x000D_
those countries to provide and support those types of--again, _x000D_
this is, obviously, from this hearing an incredibly complex, _x000D_
incredibly difficult problem. Senator Carper."
2926144,2926143,2926145,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator. Well, I will start _x000D_
with the obvious. None of these countries has ever been _x000D_
Denmark, right? But I think it is very clear from the figures _x000D_
that at least criminal violence--they used to have a lot of _x000D_
political violence, and that subsided after the peace accords _x000D_
and all that. But the level of criminal violence that we are _x000D_
witnessing today is unparalleled. It is unparalleled. It is _x000D_
unprecedented and unparalleled. It is unprecedented because the _x000D_
homicide rates that we are seeing in countries like Honduras _x000D_
and this particular year in El Salvador really, are of a level _x000D_
that has not been seen even in Colombia in its darkest days. So _x000D_
there is a big difference there, and that you do not see _x000D_
anywhere else in the world. The current intensity of the _x000D_
problem is really beyond doubt._x000D_
    As to how this affects children, well, in all sorts of _x000D_
ways. I mean, I would guess that a fearful society as these _x000D_
societies are is not a good place to raise children, is not a _x000D_
good place to educate children. And, by the way, States that _x000D_
are anemic in terms of their revenue are not able to do the _x000D_
most basic things. They are not able to provide an education to _x000D_
all these kids. And as long as they do not have an opportunity _x000D_
to get an education, as long as they do not have an opportunity _x000D_
to get proper job training, they are going to fall for the lure _x000D_
of organized criminal syndicates._x000D_
    So, it is a very difficult situation."
2926145,2926144,2926146,19241,16,    I have a Ph.D. Whatever you want to call me.
2926146,2926145,2926147,19241,16,"    Thanks. I think we have come to more or less a _x000D_
consensus here on this panel that this is a very complex _x000D_
problem and it requires a very complex solution, a _x000D_
multidimensional approach. Enforcement alone is not going to do _x000D_
it. Aid alone is not going to do it. Governments alone are not _x000D_
going to do it. And that is the only way that I see is we are _x000D_
actually going to make real progress on this, is by looking at _x000D_
all of the factors and trying to work on a comprehensive _x000D_
solution to this."
2926147,2926146,2926148,19241,16,"    Yes, I mean, I would echo what has just _x000D_
been said. I would only hope that we are also in agreement that _x000D_
there has to be buy-in from political elites in these _x000D_
countries----"
2926148,2926147,2926149,19241,16,"    For any external effort to have an impact _x000D_
in the way you want it to have an impact."
2926149,2926148,2926150,19241,16,"    Let me quickly jump in here, because we _x000D_
went down to the border, and what the Border Patrol has done is _x000D_
really extraordinary in reaction to this. The humanity that you _x000D_
have, having to grapple with an incredibly difficult problem, _x000D_
the agents down there really are doing an extraordinary job, _x000D_
and I am sure Senator Carper would agree with me on that. I _x000D_
just wanted--as long as you were making that point, I wanted to _x000D_
point that out. We truly appreciate that in terms of what you _x000D_
have done."
2926150,2926149,2926151,19241,16,"    I would say we have quite a number of _x000D_
different opinions on the mechanisms and factors that would go _x000D_
into a successful campaign. But what I think is consistent is _x000D_
that we all want the campaign to meet its policy goals. And in _x000D_
order to do that, we need to go back and check after we have _x000D_
taken these steps and after we have invested these resources to _x000D_
make sure that the goals that we have established are the right _x000D_
ones, the ones that Congress wants to achieve, and that _x000D_
whatever actions are being taken by the U.S. agencies are _x000D_
actually moving us in the direction of those goals. And if they _x000D_
are not, then we need to change course in order to meet those _x000D_
goals in the future."
2926151,2926150,2926152,19241,16,"    And if you do not have a map, you do not _x000D_
know where you are going."
2926152,2926151,2926153,19241,16,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. And we may _x000D_
have just done this. We normally give the witnesses a last _x000D_
opportunity to say something to kind of summarize things. But _x000D_
we will do it again because Senator Carper had a little more _x000D_
specific question. So we will start with you, Bishop, and just _x000D_
kind of go right down the line before we close out the hearing._x000D_
    Rev. Seitz. Once again, I thank you very much for this _x000D_
opportunity. I am really delighted we have looked at the in-_x000D_
country situation with the focus that it deserves. We have not _x000D_
spoken a whole lot about the situation in Mexico. I am _x000D_
concerned that while this is, in many ways a huge initiative on _x000D_
their part, we really need to look at the potential for abuses _x000D_
in the way that they are responding, because these children _x000D_
deserve an opportunity to tell their story and for due process _x000D_
as offered by international law._x000D_
    We need to see ourselves, as we have been in the past, a _x000D_
moral beacon in the way that we respond to these refugee _x000D_
situations. There are other countries that have received so _x000D_
many more than what we are looking at here, up to half of their _x000D_
population in refugees in the Middle East. And if we balk at _x000D_
our responsibility in this small case, it is difficult for us _x000D_
to make a claim._x000D_
    I would also encourage us to look at ways that we can _x000D_
protect the rights of children who arrive here also. I know it _x000D_
is complicated, but they are going to be hesitant to tell the _x000D_
whole story of the violence they have experienced. That has _x000D_
been my experience. You have to get to know them. And a person _x000D_
in a uniform is not necessarily going to be trusted, even _x000D_
though in our country they should ordinarily be. That has not _x000D_
been their experience in their home country. We need to give _x000D_
them a good opportunity to truly assess their situation and _x000D_
give them representation. That is the best way, by the way, _x000D_
that we can assure that they will appear in court."
2926153,2926152,2926154,19241,16,"    Thank you, Bishop. Dr. Wood."
2926154,2926153,2926155,19241,16,"    Thank you. Let me just focus my closing comments _x000D_
on the case of Mexico, because I think the Bishop makes a very _x000D_
good point here. It is an impressive advance that has happened _x000D_
in Mexico. It is a work in progress. Abuses have gone up, _x000D_
obviously. That is in large part, I would argue, because of _x000D_
increased interaction between authorities and migrants, opening _x000D_
the door for those kind of abuses._x000D_
    I think there is a great deal that can be done in terms of _x000D_
U.S.-Mexico cooperation and sharing the experiences, some of _x000D_
the very positive experiences on the U.S.-Mexico border, _x000D_
showing how migrants are treated in the United States, and _x000D_
basically I would say focus on due process._x000D_
    One of the incidents that we saw in Mexico at a detention _x000D_
center was that we asked how migrants were registered when they _x000D_
were brought in, and we were told there is no computer system _x000D_
at this holding facility, it occurs at the bigger facility. And _x000D_
I said, ``Well, they are in your hands for a couple of hours. _x000D_
How do you actually maintain those records?'' They said, ``Oh, _x000D_
we have forms that we fill out.''_x000D_
    So the guy shows me the form, and the form actually had all _x000D_
the usual questions, name, place of origin, et cetera, et _x000D_
cetera, thumbprints. But there were some questions that were _x000D_
already filled out, that were already answered on that form, on _x000D_
a supposedly blank form. One of them was, ``Are you claiming _x000D_
refugee status?'' And it said, ``No.''_x000D_
    Now, those are the kind of things of due process that I _x000D_
think we have to be very vigilant about, and we have to push _x000D_
the Mexican Government to make sure that they are doing what _x000D_
they should be doing to give people fair treatment."
2926155,2926154,2926156,19241,16,"    Thank you, Dr. Wood. Mr. Casas-Zamora."
2926156,2926155,2926157,19241,16,"    Thank you so much, Senator. It has been a _x000D_
pleasure and an honor to be part of this hearing._x000D_
    I think the United States can and perhaps should play a _x000D_
very important role in helping these countries help themselves. _x000D_
I think the Alliance for Prosperity is a good way to start. I _x000D_
hope that it leads to a more permanent engagement of the United _x000D_
States, reengagement of the United States with the region. But _x000D_
I would also say that you should not lose sight that it is _x000D_
ultimately the responsibility of the countries themselves to be _x000D_
serious about reform, and that has a very practical _x000D_
implication. Do not let the political elites of these _x000D_
countries, the political and economic elites of these countries _x000D_
off the hook--the political and economic elites that have made _x000D_
a hash job in running these countries. And that means that the _x000D_
task of nudging them toward enacting robust, progressive tax _x000D_
systems, which they do not have, and the task of making sure _x000D_
that they protect judicial independence and protect the _x000D_
autonomy of overseeing institutions are really essential._x000D_
    And my humble suggestion is that the United States should _x000D_
not be shy about demanding those structural changes. Thank you."
2926157,2926156,2926158,19241,16,"    Thank you. And, of course, you are _x000D_
describing the strings I would be talking about for any kind of _x000D_
financial aid. Agent Cabrera."
2926158,2926157,2926159,19241,16,"    Thank you, Agent, for your service as _x000D_
well."
2926159,2926158,2926160,19241,16,    Ms. Gianopoulos.
2926160,2926159,2926161,19241,16,"    Thank you for the opportunity to testify _x000D_
today. As I was just mentioning a few moments ago, it is _x000D_
important for us--we talked a lot about social media here today _x000D_
at the hearing. It is important for us as the U.S. Government _x000D_
and our agencies and our practices that we keep in mind that _x000D_
things are changing. They are changing continuously, whether it _x000D_
is the use of social media, the misperceptions about _x000D_
immigration policy, or what have you. So we need to as the U.S. _x000D_
Government continually provide oversight and evaluation for _x000D_
what it is that we are doing to try to combat some of these _x000D_
concerns and the flow of migrants, especially migrant children, _x000D_
into the United States. So continuously looking back to see: _x000D_
Are we doing what we said we wanted to do? Are we reaching the _x000D_
goals, the policy goals, the procedural and program goals that _x000D_
we have established for ourselves? And if not, then we need to _x000D_
change course or make adjustments. And hearings like this and _x000D_
other hearings that the Committee has had are perfect tools and _x000D_
operations to be able to allow the U.S. Government to do that."
2926161,2926160,2926162,19241,16,"    Thank you. And, again, thank you for the _x000D_
time you have taken, your thoughtful testimony. I think we are _x000D_
looking at the reality. I think we are very seriously exploring _x000D_
these issues and laying out how difficult the problem is. But _x000D_
that is no reason to shy away from making sure we understand _x000D_
what the full extent of the problem is._x000D_
    Again, thank you all. The hearing record will remain open _x000D_
for 15 days until November 5 at 5 p.m. for the submission of _x000D_
statements and questions for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2926162,2926161,2926163,19241,18,"    Good morning. This hearing of the Senate _x000D_
Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is now _x000D_
called to order._x000D_
    I want to thank the State of Arizona, Governor Ducey, and _x000D_
my colleagues, Senator Flake and Senator McCain, for inviting _x000D_
us here and discussing an incredibly important topic: The _x000D_
security of our border, an enormous problem facing this Nation._x000D_
    The title of this hearing is ``America's Heroin Epidemic at _x000D_
the Border: Local, State, and Federal Law Enforcement Efforts _x000D_
to Combat Illicit Narcotic Trafficking.''_x000D_
    When I became chairman of this Committee in January of this _x000D_
year, one of the top priorities of the Subcommittee was really _x000D_
border security, and this is our 13th hearing, trying to lay _x000D_
out the reality of the situation._x000D_
    I was talking to the Governor earlier. And coming from the _x000D_
business world, particularly in my case, manufacturing, I have _x000D_
solved a lot of problems. And there is actually a process to go _x000D_
through solving a problem. It starts with laying out the _x000D_
reality of the situation. And based on that reality, you set _x000D_
yourself up with achievable goals. Then you start to design the _x000D_
strategies._x000D_
    We have an enormous problem in this Nation. What is my true _x000D_
definition of a problem? One that does not have any solutions. _x000D_
It is multi-faceted, multi-cause. One thing I will say, having _x000D_
spent now the better part of the entire year fully exploring _x000D_
this with hearings, with trips to the border, with trips to _x000D_
Central America, there are multiple causes. I think a number of _x000D_
Members on the Committee would agree with me on this--the root _x000D_
cause of the fact that we do not have a secure border is _x000D_
America's insatiable demand for drugs, because that demand has _x000D_
given rise to the rise of the drug cartels._x000D_
    And I always point out, the drug cartels, it is a business. _x000D_
And they have learned to expand the product line. They have a _x000D_
smuggling route, and then they begin, to think well, let us _x000D_
just use that for human trafficking, sex trafficking. They _x000D_
start using economic migrants as diversion for their illicit _x000D_
drug trafficking. So it is an enormous problem._x000D_
    I know I am making no big statement. I will ask that my _x000D_
brief opening statement be entered into the record\1\ without _x000D_
objection. And also that Senator Kelly Ayotte's statement also _x000D_
be entered into the record.\2\_x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    We held a hearing up in New Hampshire where she was in _x000D_
charge of that hearing as the chairperson, describing the _x000D_
problem of heroin overdoses in New Hampshire. It starts: In _x000D_
2008, in New Hampshire there were 16 overdoses from heroin. Now _x000D_
there's nearly 250 overdoses reported in 2014._x000D_
    And in Wisconsin, very similarly, between 2000 and 2007, _x000D_
Wisconsin averaged about 29 heroin overdoses; already 200 in _x000D_
2014. I think we are on pace, unfortunately, to break that _x000D_
record in 2015. So this is an enormously difficult problem. And _x000D_
it is one that we have to face._x000D_
    We have a very distinguished panel, two panels of witnesses _x000D_
here, including the Governor of the State of Arizona. I really _x000D_
do appreciate everybody's attention to this matter._x000D_
    I am really looking forward to hearing our witnesses, lay _x000D_
out that reality. And, again, it is a harsh reality. It is not _x000D_
fun to look at, and we are going to have a number of things we _x000D_
have to do to start solving them._x000D_
    So with that, I will turn it over to my distinguished _x000D_
colleague, Senator McCain, for his opening statement."
2926163,2926162,2926164,19241,18,"    It was sunny, a little chilly."
2926164,2926163,2926165,19241,18,"    Thank you, Senator McCain. Senator Flake."
2926165,2926164,2926166,19241,18,"    Senator Flake I did fail to mention based _x000D_
on those 13 hearings, we are releasing today the State of _x000D_
America's Border Security Report, over a hundred pages, pretty _x000D_
well laying out that reality, which I think, is the first step _x000D_
of solving that problem._x000D_
    So the tradition of this Committee is to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you will all rise and raise your right hand._x000D_
    Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before _x000D_
this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing _x000D_
but the truth, so help you, God?"
2926166,2926165,2926167,19241,18,    I do.
2926167,2926166,2926168,19241,18,    I do.
2926168,2926167,2926169,19241,18,    I do.
2926169,2926168,2926170,19241,18,"    Our first witness will be the Honorable _x000D_
Governor Douglas Ducey. Governor Ducey is the Governor of the _x000D_
State of Arizona. He began his career in the private sector _x000D_
where he helped launch Cold Stone Creamery, which under his _x000D_
watch grew from a local ice cream scoop shop to over 1,400 _x000D_
locations._x000D_
    In 2008 and 2009 Governor Ducey, alarmed by the State _x000D_
economy and the massive spending debt the government was _x000D_
incurring, sought public office and was elected on November 2, _x000D_
2010, as Arizona's 32nd State Treasurer. After serving out this _x000D_
term, he was elected Governor. Governor Ducey._x000D_

2926170,2926169,2926171,19241,18,"    Chairman Johnson, good morning. Welcome to _x000D_
Arizona._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Governor Ducey appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1966._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Senator McCain, Senator Flake, thank you for the kind _x000D_
words, and I look forward to talking with you this morning._x000D_
    Commissioner Kerlikowske, Bill Montgomery, Sheriff Dannels, _x000D_
and everyone joining me today to give testimony, thank you for _x000D_
your commitment to addressing and reversing a very severe and a _x000D_
very real problem in Arizona and in our country._x000D_
    We are here today because our Nation is plagued by a _x000D_
destructive, dangerous, and deadly epidemic. Heroin trafficking _x000D_
use, abuse, and overdose is a growing problem in American _x000D_
society. It is influencing and infiltrating our children's _x000D_
schools. It is tearing apart families. It is spurring crime and _x000D_
creating criminals._x000D_
    It is driving up costs related to drug enforcement, courts, _x000D_
incarceration, treatment programs, medical care, and other _x000D_
unseen expenses to our taxpayers. And that is nothing compared _x000D_
to the human toll._x000D_
    There is no dollar sign on the life of a father, a mother, _x000D_
a sibling, a child, or a spouse cut short by drug abuse. There _x000D_
is only anguish and anger._x000D_
    We have come face to face with a very sad, very scary _x000D_
reality. Heroin is no longer someone else's problem. It is our _x000D_
problem. It is Arizona's problem. It is America's problem. And _x000D_
Arizona is the front door._x000D_
    It is not news to any of us that Arizona has been and _x000D_
continues to be a major smuggling corridor and distribution hub _x000D_
for illicit drugs being supplied to the United States. We share _x000D_
roughly 370 miles of continuous international border with _x000D_
Mexico. The area consists of rugged terrain that makes it _x000D_
extremely difficult to patrol and secure, a prime environment _x000D_
for trafficking activity._x000D_
    Right across our border is home to the Sinaloa Cartel, a _x000D_
transnational drug trafficking organization (DTO) with a _x000D_
stronghold in the region. Unless we act and act soon, these _x000D_
cartels and the poison they are bringing to our communities are _x000D_
not going anywhere._x000D_
    Let us look at the facts. From 2010 to 2014, heroin _x000D_
seizures increased 223 percent in Arizona. Why? Sadly, because _x000D_
prescription opiate drug abuse often leads to heroin addiction, _x000D_
and that is because heroin's a cheaper, quicker, and more _x000D_
intense high. The effects have been staggering. In 2015, drug _x000D_
apprehension efforts in Arizona resulted in 5,282 drug-related _x000D_
arrests. An arrest for heroin alone increased 76 percent over _x000D_
the past 2 years, which constitutes the largest rate of heroin _x000D_
arrests in a decade. Studies have also shown heroin treatment _x000D_
admissions increased approximately 77 percent from 2008 to _x000D_
2012._x000D_
    And here is why it should matter to all of us. The impact _x000D_
of heroin reaches far beyond user and supplier._x000D_
    It is having a cumulative effect on the standard of living _x000D_
in Arizona and throughout our country._x000D_
    More than 75 percent of inmates in Arizona's prison system _x000D_
have a substance abuse problem. There are more than 17,000 _x000D_
children who are wards of the State because their parents are _x000D_
unfit to raise them. If we found them all homes tomorrow in _x000D_
foster care, there would be thousands more waiting right behind _x000D_
them unless we address the corrosive nature of drug addiction._x000D_
    Babies, newborns exposed to substances rose from 597 cases _x000D_
in 2008 to 1,248 in 2014. That is a 109 percent, more than _x000D_
double, increase in just 6 years. Each one of these is a _x000D_
tragedy, a terrible, preventable tragedy._x000D_
    There is no shortage of the harmful effects of heroin and _x000D_
illicit drug trafficking in our communities. Some of these _x000D_
damages can not be undone, but they can be prevented in the _x000D_
future. It is up to us right now to act. And we are taking _x000D_
action by aggressively targeting the supply._x000D_
    As we know, Arizona is ground zero in the fight against _x000D_
drug trafficking, a direct nexus through which these cartels _x000D_
are infiltrating our States and ravaging communities in every _x000D_
corner of our country._x000D_
    That does not sit well with me, which is why we are taking _x000D_
action and why I have created the Arizona Border Strike Force _x000D_
Bureau._x000D_
    Here are the highlights: The mission of the Border Strike _x000D_
Force Bureau is to partner with local and Federal agencies to _x000D_
deter, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations _x000D_
responsible for smuggling drugs and humans into Arizona. The _x000D_
success of the bureau is founded upon strategic partnerships we _x000D_
have created at all levels._x000D_
    The most significant so far have been with U.S. Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection and the Cochise County Sheriff's Office._x000D_
    I want to take a moment to acknowledge Commissioner Gil _x000D_
Kerlikowske and Sheriff Mark Dannels for their willingness to _x000D_
partner with the State of Arizona to the Border Strike Force _x000D_
Bureau. In a State like Arizona, the cost of combating drug _x000D_
cartels alone would be too large to bear. A successful long-_x000D_
term strategy to take the fight to the cartels requires _x000D_
multilayered collaboration and cooperation, intelligence _x000D_
sharing, better communication. All of these serve as a force _x000D_
multiplier that is magnifying our individual efforts._x000D_
    This strike force has been in operation for a little over 2 _x000D_
months utilizing these partnerships, and our successes speak _x000D_
for themselves._x000D_
    Since September we have seized over $2.2 million in cash, _x000D_
multiple firearms, nearly 4,000 pounds of marijuana, 73 pounds _x000D_
of meth, nearly 19 pounds of heroin. It is important to note _x000D_
that in 2014, Arizona and DPS seized 14 pounds of heroin total. _x000D_
And we have seized nearly 19 pounds in just the last 2 months._x000D_
    To paint a picture of how much that really is, there are _x000D_
45,000 individual hits to one pound of heroin. We have made _x000D_
over 150 felony arrests and 30 misdemeanor arrests. We have _x000D_
taken down 14 documented gang members and over 70 undocumented _x000D_
aliens. And we have done it in just a short time with a short _x000D_
list of personnel, scarce resources, and through minimal _x000D_
targeted operations. It was important to build a partnership, _x000D_
prove the concept, and to get some wins._x000D_
    Now imagine what we could do with more. This is a _x000D_
significant concrete example of what we can accomplish when we _x000D_
take a multilevel, collaborative, and cooperative approach to _x000D_
dealing with public safety. It is also a loud wake-up call that _x000D_
our current strategies have fallen short. We need a plan that _x000D_
is robust, that leverages resources, manpower, and money from _x000D_
local, State, and Federal levels._x000D_
    I have spent a lot of time meeting with ranchers, families, _x000D_
law enforcement, and residents near the border. I know you all _x000D_
have as well. The greatest concerns among them are the cartels _x000D_
and the traffickers in a place where they live and work and _x000D_
raise their family. Border-related crime is a frequent _x000D_
occurrence. If there were ever a time to get serious about _x000D_
protecting our homeland, it is now._x000D_
    In addition to the drug epidemic, I would be remiss if I _x000D_
did not mention another potential threat to our country as a _x000D_
result of Arizona's border. In light of the horrific terrorist _x000D_
attacks in Paris, new threats on the United States from ISIS in _x000D_
a video released last week and recent apprehensions of Middle _x000D_
Eastern nationals near the Southern Border, one thing's for _x000D_
sure: It is time to step up our game._x000D_
    On behalf of the citizens of the State of Arizona, I want _x000D_
to thank Commissioner Kerlikowske and his hard-working, _x000D_
talented, and dedicated team who made these apprehensions last _x000D_
week._x000D_
    After what we have seen in the past couple of months with _x000D_
the Border Strike Force, I am encouraged about our partnership. _x000D_
I believe this is the most meaningful step toward securing _x000D_
Arizona that we have seen in decades. But more vigilance, _x000D_
collaboration and resources are needed if we are going to be _x000D_
successful in keeping our State and our citizens safe._x000D_
    As Governor of Arizona, I took an oath of office to protect _x000D_
Arizona and our country. Arizona must hold the line for the _x000D_
sake of every State, every community, and every family in this _x000D_
country, and we intend to do so. But we can not do it alone._x000D_
    Arizona can do a lot, and we will, to combat this epidemic, _x000D_
to slam the door on these cartels and to protect the safety, _x000D_
security, health, and quality of life for our citizens. But we _x000D_
need your help. This is not just Arizona's problem. It is _x000D_
America's problem. And it is going to need to be met with _x000D_
State, local, and Federal resources: More funding, more assets, _x000D_
more planes, helicopters, radios, and equipment added to our _x000D_
arsenal. More personnel, troopers, analysts, pilots, people to _x000D_
gather intelligence on these criminals, and people to take them _x000D_
down._x000D_
    Ask yourself: What is our primary duty, our highest _x000D_
priority as elected officials?_x000D_
    The answer should be defending our homeland and protecting _x000D_
our citizens._x000D_
    For the first time in recent memory, we have a plan that _x000D_
can yield real, meaningful results in this effort. We are ready _x000D_
to do something about this problem, and we are ready to do it _x000D_
now._x000D_
    This could mean the difference between saving one life or _x000D_
countless lives, bringing down one criminal or an entire _x000D_
cartel. It could mean preventing a tragedy in Arizona or _x000D_
somewhere else._x000D_
    Data shows that from 2012 to 2014, there were at least 458 _x000D_
drug seizures in 30 other American States with a nexus back to _x000D_
Arizona. I ask you, as Federal representatives of the people, _x000D_
to deliver Arizona's message to Congress. If you are serious _x000D_
about taking the fight to drug cartels and turning the tide on _x000D_
the drug epidemic ravaging our Nation, join us. Arizona is on _x000D_
the front line, and we need your support._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926171,2926170,2926172,19241,18,"    Thank you, Governor Ducey._x000D_
    Our next witness is Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske._x000D_
    Commissioner Kerlikowske is Commissioner of U.S. Customs _x000D_
and Border Protection, at the U.S. Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security (DHS). Commissioner Kerlikowske is also the former _x000D_
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). _x000D_
Commissioner Kerlikowske has four decades of law enforcement _x000D_
and drug policy expertise. And it's also his birthday today._x000D_
    So welcome. Happy birthday. And we look forward to your _x000D_
testimony._x000D_
_x000D_
TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE,\1\ COMMISSIONER, _x000D_
U."
2926172,2926171,2926173,19241,18,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson, _x000D_
Senator McCain, Senator Flake. I appreciate the opportunity to _x000D_
be here and discuss this important hearing. I testified at _x000D_
Senator Ayotte's hearing in New Hampshire. I think it speaks _x000D_
volumes when you are having a hearing on this issue from New _x000D_
Hampshire all the way to Arizona on the southwest border._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Commissioner Kerlikowske appears in _x000D_
the Appendix on page 1971._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926173,2926172,2926174,19241,18,"    Commissioner Kerlikowske, if you could _x000D_
move your microphone up."
2926174,2926173,2926175,19241,18,"    And I think this really speaks _x000D_
volumes about the difficulties of the problem and the fact that _x000D_
the heroin issue is so wide ranging._x000D_
    On a typical day, Customs and Border Protection seizes _x000D_
about 6 tons of illegal drugs. For the past several years, our _x000D_
heroin seizures have been increasing. Last fiscal year (FY), _x000D_
they increased 23 percent. So far to date, they have increased _x000D_
about 17 percent._x000D_
    Now, while the vast majority of heroin entering the United _x000D_
States comes in through the southwest border, it does so _x000D_
through the ports of entry. We have a variety of sophisticated _x000D_
technology and people, the use of canines and others. I would _x000D_
tell you that the most important thing and the most impressive _x000D_
thing I have seen is the resulting of these seizures._x000D_
    It is between two areas. One is the quality of our people. _x000D_
They are very good at spotting everything from drugs coming in _x000D_
through cut flowers at Miami airport, to internal carriers at _x000D_
JFK, to taking apart cars at the border, use of the canines. _x000D_
But it is also, as the Governor mentioned, and Senator McCain _x000D_
mentioned, it is also the collaboration and the importance of _x000D_
that collaboration with State and local partners._x000D_
    These continued efforts are important to intercept _x000D_
narcotics at the border, and they are a key aspect of _x000D_
addressing the crisis. But we clearly, all of us, recognize _x000D_
that merely doing interdictions and arrests is not going to be _x000D_
enough to solve this heroin epidemic._x000D_
    When I got out of the Army in 1972 and joined the police _x000D_
department, several years later became a narcotics detective, _x000D_
several years later, commanded a narcotics unit. And then was _x000D_
police chief in two of the nation's largest cities, along with _x000D_
being the President's drug policy advisor, and now with Customs _x000D_
and Border Protection, I have had some real experience with _x000D_
this issue._x000D_
    We have skipped a generation of young people that are naive _x000D_
about the dangers of heroin; and as we all know, as we have all _x000D_
been talking about, it is making a strong resurgence._x000D_
    Secretary Johnson's Southern Border and Approaches Campaign _x000D_
is important in the creation just recently of the three joint _x000D_
task forces (JTF) using all of the DHS components as a _x000D_
particular step forward, and it moves to increase our _x000D_
collaboration across the border with State and local law _x000D_
enforcement._x000D_
    I want to commend the Governor and certainly Colonel _x000D_
Milstead for the work that Arizona is doing. We have been _x000D_
involved, and they have kept us involved in all of the _x000D_
different discussions on this new strike force. We could not be _x000D_
more proud to be a partner and to be collaborative on that._x000D_
    I am also pleased that the Office of National Drug Control _x000D_
Policy and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have a National _x000D_
Heroin Task Force that they jointly chair. We also do a lot of _x000D_
training for the private sector, because they are an important _x000D_
partner in all of this. So when you have people that are _x000D_
driving the trucks and operating the rails and operating in the _x000D_
maritime environment, the more that we can educate them about _x000D_
what smugglers may use to try and get these drugs in, the _x000D_
better partner they become._x000D_
    And our Office of Air and Marine (AMO) has a program called _x000D_
SKY PRO, which I will be happy to talk about later._x000D_
    Last, I will tell you that in the over 6 years that I have _x000D_
been with the Administration, the opportunity to meet with many _x000D_
officials in the government of Mexico has presented itself to _x000D_
me. I think that to a person, whether it is the Drug _x000D_
Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs and Border _x000D_
Protection, and others, would tell you that the cooperation and _x000D_
the information being shared with the government of Mexico _x000D_
officials to combat this issue on both sides of the border is _x000D_
at a very high level._x000D_
    So I look forward to your questions and thank you for the _x000D_
opportunity to be here."
2926175,2926174,2926176,19241,18,"    Thank you, Commissioner._x000D_
    We are going to kind of open this up a little bit in terms _x000D_
of being too structured where we each get our 7 minutes. We are _x000D_
going to start going down different lines of questioning. And I _x000D_
encourage Senator McCain and Senator Flake to just chime in _x000D_
when it makes sense._x000D_
    Let me start, though. This is obviously a complex problem. _x000D_
There are all kinds of things we have to do._x000D_
    But what I would like to ask both the Governor and _x000D_
Commissioner, understanding we need resources, we need the _x000D_
resource to do any of these things--set that aside; that is _x000D_
just a given--what is the top one, two, or three things that we _x000D_
must do to address this problem?"
2926176,2926175,2926177,19241,18,"    So there are a number of things. First and _x000D_
foremost, I would say it is the cooperation between the State _x000D_
level, the Federal level, the county level, and the local _x000D_
level. Rather than being a confrontation, the fact that we are _x000D_
bringing these agencies and this enforcement together can make _x000D_
a real measurable difference in this._x000D_
    And I think you touched on this as well, Chairman. It is _x000D_
the insatiable desire and demand for drugs that we have in this _x000D_
country is the other part of the equation that we have to deal _x000D_
with here._x000D_
    And then, last, I will reiterate it because it is critical, _x000D_
that the funding and partnership with the Federal Government _x000D_
with set objectives is what success looks like, is critical to _x000D_
the success of this."
2926177,2926176,2926178,19241,18,"    OK. So out of that, not to complain, _x000D_
but--so you had cooperation. That is obviously natural. But to _x000D_
do what? So address the demand side and, of course, the need _x000D_
for funding._x000D_
    Commissioner, I will ask you: The actions, I mean, what _x000D_
must we do in a cooperative fashion with proper funding?_x000D_
    So one thing is to address the demand side. I mean, I _x000D_
completely agree. When I was down in Guatemala with General _x000D_
Kelly, we were obviously just talking about the drug cartels _x000D_
and how basically they are off limits and destroy those public _x000D_
institutions._x000D_
    General Kelly asked me the question: When was the last time _x000D_
as a nation we actually had concerted public relations _x000D_
education campaigns to try and dissuade Americans, but _x000D_
particularly our young, from doing drugs? And according to _x000D_
General Kelly, it was under Nancy Reagan: Just Say No._x000D_
    And he talked about that famous commercial with a couple of _x000D_
eggs, ``Here's your brain.'' Scrambled up, ``Here's your brain _x000D_
on drugs.'' So, again, so that is the address on the demand _x000D_
side. What are other things? Actions that cooperatively with _x000D_
proper funding must do."
2926178,2926177,2926179,19241,18,"    For us it would be congressional _x000D_
support for technology. We have a lot of boots on the ground, _x000D_
but the technology is truly the game changer in all of this. _x000D_
Whether it is our unmanned aircraft that you got to see when _x000D_
you visited the border, whether it is replacing our _x000D_
nonintrusive inspection devices, just big x-rays that have _x000D_
reached the most useful life cycle, we need that type of new _x000D_
equipment. And the research and development (R&D) that goes _x000D_
into that technology is huge._x000D_
    We could not be more appreciative of the Department of _x000D_
Defense giving us the remote video surveillance systems, the _x000D_
tethered aerostats. All three of you have seen a lot of this _x000D_
technology, but it needs to be supported, and it needs to be _x000D_
improved upon."
2926179,2926178,2926180,19241,18,"    OK. So technology to detect people coming _x000D_
to this country illegally. Do we have the manpower once we _x000D_
detect to actually apprehend?"
2926180,2926179,2926181,19241,18,"    Well, one is that the Border _x000D_
Patrol is more than doubled in size since 2007, 2008. We are _x000D_
having difficulty hiring right now in the United States Border _x000D_
Patrol (USBP). We are having difficulty hiring our Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection officers. A lot of law enforcement agencies _x000D_
that I know at the State and local level are having that _x000D_
difficulty._x000D_
    Your support for the veterans hiring. I can not think of _x000D_
another Federal organization that has done as well as we have _x000D_
when it comes to the number of veterans in CBP. But the fact _x000D_
that we are aggressively working with the Department of Defense _x000D_
(DOD) to get the people that will be leaving the Army as it _x000D_
restructures, to get them to come and be a part of Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection is a great opportunity. And that _x000D_
congressional support, your ability to use the stature and the _x000D_
positions you hold to support veterans coming into CBP, is a _x000D_
big help to us."
2926181,2926180,2926182,19241,18,"    So let us say we have the manpower to _x000D_
detect, we apprehend, what are we doing in terms of our own _x000D_
laws in terms of processing and in many cases releasing? Can _x000D_
you kind of speak to that and the incentive that creates? _x000D_
Because, bottom line is: If the people come into this country _x000D_
illegally, and they are caught, and they are released, and they _x000D_
are in the State illegally without consequence. Or, for _x000D_
example, the drug traffickers, juveniles that we do not _x000D_
prosecute that we also face, criminally speaking, can you speak _x000D_
to that problem?"
2926182,2926181,2926183,19241,18,"    If they are caught with drugs, I _x000D_
do not think we have seen any problem with prosecutions either _x000D_
at the State level or at the Federal level. I think the State _x000D_
prosecutors will probably tell you that they would like to be _x000D_
reimbursed by the Federal Government for some of those costs _x000D_
involved in that, and I think that is important._x000D_
    So the prosecution of, particularly for a drug smuggler, is _x000D_
critical because that is the way that we also get the _x000D_
information about who is behind it, who is part of the _x000D_
pipeline. If there is no sanction and they are just released, _x000D_
even if it is a smaller amount of drugs, I do not think that is _x000D_
helpful."
2926183,2926182,2926184,19241,18,"    Governor, you spoke about, obviously your _x000D_
initial success now in terms of breaking up some of these drug _x000D_
cartels on the Arizona side of the border. What do you know in _x000D_
terms of the drug cartels' control of the Mexico side of the _x000D_
border?"
2926184,2926183,2926185,19241,18,"    That is definitely part of this equation. I _x000D_
mean, I am in my first 11 months in office here, but I do have _x000D_
the commitment of the Governor of Sonora, Claudia Pavlovich, in _x000D_
terms of cooperation and communication to combat this issue._x000D_
    In addition to that, I want to amplify what the _x000D_
commissioner said. It is not only about law enforcement assets, _x000D_
but it is about proper prosecution. And having the prosecutors _x000D_
available and competitively paid so that when there are _x000D_
arrests, we can complete that to return people to their country _x000D_
of origin, but also to lock up the bad guys."
2926185,2926184,2926186,19241,18,"    When I toured the border through the Rio _x000D_
Grande Valley, touring with some local officials that _x000D_
complained to me that unless, for example, that the quantity of _x000D_
marijuana was 5 pounds or above, locals did not even bother _x000D_
with the prosecution of it._x000D_
    Is that something similar here in Arizona?"
2926186,2926185,2926187,19241,18,"    I hear those stories as well through the _x000D_
county prosecutors and county sheriffs. And to your point, _x000D_
Chairman Johnson, on the wrong incentives, I think if we are _x000D_
telegraphing what you can get away with, we are going to have _x000D_
more distribution and more trafficking. And that is why I think _x000D_
we need to tighten the screws on this."
2926187,2926186,2926188,19241,18,    Senator McCain.
2926188,2926187,2926189,19241,18,    Yes.
2926189,2926188,2926190,19241,18,    Yes.
2926190,2926189,2926191,19241,18,"    I know they are vicious, and I _x000D_
know no one crosses a plaza of a cartel without paying a price."
2926191,2926190,2926192,19241,18,"    Or it passes through them for a _x000D_
fee."
2926192,2926191,2926193,19241,18,"    Senator McCain, the drugs get up here into _x000D_
the Phoenix metropolitan area, and they go to what we term _x000D_
stash houses where from there they may be sold to additional _x000D_
distributors or repackaged for further trafficking, either west _x000D_
or east. We have the benefit of having a pretty intricate _x000D_
interstate highway system here where several different highways _x000D_
come together, and they exploit that._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Montgomery appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1981._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926193,2926192,2926194,19241,18,    Absolutely not.
2926194,2926193,2926195,19241,18,"    No. In order for us to be able to deal with _x000D_
all the drugs that are getting through--and I would underscore, _x000D_
too, that seizures at Arizona ports of entry are substantially _x000D_
on the increase. But the cartels are still getting enough drugs _x000D_
through to make it financially lucrative to continue to try and _x000D_
exploit Arizona's border._x000D_
    Again, going to some of the prepared remarks, but just with _x000D_
a few local investigations, local law enforcement has seized _x000D_
131 pounds of heroin just within the last several months. So _x000D_
while we have seen the percentage and the size of seizures _x000D_
increase at Arizona ports of entry due to great fortified _x000D_
Customs and Border Protection, there is still so much getting _x000D_
through._x000D_
    And right now I have 15 prosecutors assigned to my Drug _x000D_
Enforcement Bureau, all of whom are more than gainfully _x000D_
employed right now. And we do not have the luxury, I would say, _x000D_
as a local law enforcement prosecutor to turn away cases. I _x000D_
have no arbitrary thresholds below which I will not take cases. _x000D_
Because if I do not do it, it will not get done."
2926195,2926194,2926196,19241,18,"    Well, I think the difficulty has _x000D_
been, Senator, is that when Congress authorized a lot of money, _x000D_
particularly for the Border Patrol in 2007 and 2008, we rushed _x000D_
very quickly to get a number of people on board._x000D_
    Not all of those people would be hired today. We stopped _x000D_
doing a polygraph examination during that period. As you know, _x000D_
Congress has made that mandatory with the work of leadership of _x000D_
Senator Cornyn on that. So the process to get very good people _x000D_
who have been clearly vetted is time-consuming._x000D_
    The job market is better right now. And, frankly, if you _x000D_
are a talented Customs and Border Protection or Border Patrol _x000D_
officer, you have a college degree, you are fluent in Spanish, _x000D_
there are a lot of other opportunities out there for you. So _x000D_
particularly with the Border Patrol, we are losing more people _x000D_
than we are actually able to hire. And we just have to support _x000D_
it._x000D_
    And as I think all of you know, right now this is a _x000D_
difficult time for any level of law enforcement in the public's _x000D_
eye. And we really need to kind of turn that and work to turn _x000D_
that image around."
2926196,2926195,2926197,19241,18,"    Senator, we are losing on this front._x000D_
    You can look at the cost here, and that is a reflection of _x000D_
the supply. But I think what is more important than the _x000D_
statistics and the numbers is the effect that it has on our _x000D_
State and has on our country._x000D_
    I can tell you that everything that I am dealing with as _x000D_
Governor beyond K-12 education: Chronic homelessness _x000D_
oftentimes; unemployment; poverty; joblessness; the 17,000 _x000D_
children that are wards of the State; the parents that are _x000D_
unfit to care for them; domestic violence; the people, the men _x000D_
and women, that populate our prisons. There is a central _x000D_
unifying theme of drug abuse and addiction._x000D_
    So there is a tremendous human toll not only on the _x000D_
families of our State and our country, but the cost to our _x000D_
government in terms of public policy."
2926197,2926196,2926198,19241,18,    Appreciate the invitation. Senator Flake.
2926198,2926197,2926199,19241,18,"    Senator Flake, let me just quick jump in _x000D_
here because I always say when a train does not derail, that is _x000D_
good news. It is just not news._x000D_
    I mean, here is a bill that was very good news, and it was _x000D_
done because we concentrated not just amongst ourselves, but _x000D_
with, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I mean, _x000D_
that was an area of agreement that unified us. So we were able _x000D_
to get this passed and signed into law. I mean, everybody _x000D_
involved in this, and it was really the leadership of these two _x000D_
gentlemen here that really gets credit in that._x000D_
    But, again, there is good news. If you concentrate on the _x000D_
areas of agreement, you actually can accomplish things to get _x000D_
resolved, and Senator McCain and Senator Flake made that _x000D_
happen."
2926199,2926198,2926200,19241,18,"    Well, Senator, so sadly I will _x000D_
tell you that the long history of attempting to influence the _x000D_
price by interdiction or interception is analogous to _x000D_
attempting to reduce the number of diamonds in this country by _x000D_
seizing the lumps of coal. That is a fact. Reducing the demand, _x000D_
as all of you have mentioned, is going to be critical if there _x000D_
is less demand._x000D_
    But there is two other important points in here. One is _x000D_
that under President Calderon's administration, we all know _x000D_
that the Mexican Military is used to do an awful lot of local _x000D_
law enforcement. I believe they did less of eradication where _x000D_
the poppies are being grown in Mexico._x000D_
    Very hopeful with this relationship with the government of _x000D_
Mexico, that they will be back involved in greater efforts and _x000D_
eradication because the heroin problem is not just one for us. _x000D_
It is also one for Mexico. So rather than pay a smuggler to _x000D_
bring drugs into the United States, that smuggler may be paid _x000D_
in product. That product will be sold locally on the plazas and _x000D_
the cities and the towns in Mexico._x000D_
    So eradication is important. Greater interdiction is _x000D_
important. But in the long term, reducing our demand, as all of _x000D_
you have mentioned, is going to be one of the better aspects of _x000D_
how to deal with this."
2926200,2926199,2926201,19241,18,"    In addition to that, Senator, I think it is _x000D_
important to point out the prescription opiate drug abuse that _x000D_
exists in this country. So there are things we can do beyond _x000D_
law enforcement and prosecution in terms of reforms around _x000D_
prescriptions and how many of these pills are prescribed and _x000D_
for what, how many, and how many refills._x000D_
    And I will defer to Colonel Milstead on how the supply and _x000D_
demand has affected the consumption in terms of the pricing _x000D_
structure. But it is in addition to the cartels. There is _x000D_
always also things we can do right here at home."
2926201,2926200,2926202,19241,18,"    Well, I would just ask every parent that is _x000D_
in the room: Has this affected their family or their neighbor's _x000D_
family or your extended family in terms of drug abuse and _x000D_
addiction and the human toll that this brings to a family in _x000D_
terms of pain and anguish and anger and drug abuse?_x000D_
    My experience traveling the State over the last year is _x000D_
that this affects all of our communities and, in fact, affects _x000D_
all of our families, either directly or indirectly. And that _x000D_
does not even go to the fact that we have so many people living _x000D_
in a lower standard of life today than they did before the _x000D_
downturn. And I can not tell you how many small business _x000D_
entrepreneurs tell me when they go to hire for a position, that _x000D_
they can not find people that can pass the drug test. So I _x000D_
think it is affecting us in our homes and our families, but it _x000D_
is also affecting our economy and our productivity as a State _x000D_
and a nation."
2926202,2926201,2926203,19241,18,"    Thank you, Senator Flake. Just to pick up _x000D_
on the drug test. I know as I traveled around the State of _x000D_
Wisconsin, there is not one manufacturer that can hire enough _x000D_
people and for multiple reasons. One of them is they do drug _x000D_
testing. 50 percent of the people, when they find out they have _x000D_
to take a drug test, do not show up. Of those that do take the _x000D_
drug test, 50 percent fail. So you are already a ways down the _x000D_
list there._x000D_
    Commissioner, I do want to pick up a little bit on the _x000D_
poppy issue. When I was down in Central America, we were _x000D_
certainly briefed that for the farmers, it is 50 times more _x000D_
profitable for them to grow poppies than really any other crop. _x000D_
The abundance of crops they can grow down in Central America--_x000D_
it is a great place to grow crops--50 times more profitable. _x000D_
Plus, they do not even have to transport it. So that is huge. _x000D_
Heroin poppies are an extremely profitable crop, and that is _x000D_
also part of the issue._x000D_
    But I do want to talk--in our report, in testimony, former _x000D_
Drug Czar General Barry McCaffrey testified that we are only _x000D_
interdicting about 10 percent of the illegal drugs coming to _x000D_
the Southern Border. I know we had testimony from the Coast _x000D_
Guard separately, only interdicting 11 to 18 percent over our _x000D_
maritime border._x000D_
    I will just ask the panel: Anybody want to either confirm _x000D_
or dispute those types of numbers?"
2926203,2926202,2926204,19241,18,"    When I was in Seattle as the _x000D_
police chief, I was his police chief, so I would get a lot of _x000D_
advice from General McCaffrey. I would tell you that I think _x000D_
there is one big issue of trying to determine what percentage _x000D_
we interdict or do not interdict, and that is that we do not _x000D_
know what we do not know._x000D_
    So we are doing a much better job, as I said. Our increases _x000D_
last fiscal year, our continuing increases this fiscal year. _x000D_
When Senator McCain talked about our appetite for drugs in this _x000D_
country, we have got to work to reduce that. So I have seen _x000D_
lots of economists and, reminds me of when President Truman _x000D_
said: If you lined up all the economists end to end, would not _x000D_
that be a beautiful sight?_x000D_
    You mentioned that I have seen lots of econometric pieces _x000D_
on this, and, frankly, I still think that there are a lot of _x000D_
questions about how much are we missing versus how much do we _x000D_
interdict?"
2926204,2926203,2926205,19241,18,"    Well, again, those are difficult numbers _x000D_
to come up with. But we can estimate our basic total usage in _x000D_
America. Again, it is not just General McCaffrey. It is also _x000D_
the Coast Guard. Bottom line is: We have an enormous flow _x000D_
coming into this country illegally that we are not catching. Is _x000D_
that kind of without dispute? Mr. Montgomery."
2926205,2926204,2926206,19241,18,"    Chairman Johnson, I think that is true. The _x000D_
cartels have a high level of tolerance for the amount of drugs _x000D_
that are being seized for them to continue the same sorts of _x000D_
routes that they try to exploit. And it is not until they _x000D_
suffer severe economic pain in trying to exploit a particular _x000D_
route that they are going to change and shift their behaviors._x000D_
    And I think that is also somewhat reflected too in the _x000D_
chart, the pricing chart. A couple of other points that I would _x000D_
offer to consider in this context is, when you look at the _x000D_
early 1990s, the high price for heroin and methamphetamine, _x000D_
over time the drug cartels have been able to improve their own _x000D_
economies of scale where they can produce these drugs at a much _x000D_
lower price than what it used to cost them._x000D_
    They do not have to import heroin from South America or _x000D_
import it in a way where it originates out of Afghanistan. They _x000D_
are growing it locally. It costs them less to produce. They _x000D_
have improved their ability to produce high-quality heroin by _x000D_
mimicking what Colombian drug cartels were able to do._x000D_
    So you have product closer to its source in greater _x000D_
amounts, and they have been able to cut out the middleman in _x000D_
order to transport their product into the country. Each one of _x000D_
those different improvements obviously allows you, then, to _x000D_
sell for less and still maintain a high profit potential._x000D_
    And when it comes to methamphetamine, back in the 1990s it _x000D_
used to be a product of lower yield, small labs domestically. _x000D_
And so there was a lot of danger. The product was not very _x000D_
good. You could charge more if you were a good dealer. But now _x000D_
you have super labs producing methamphetamine just across the _x000D_
border, and that is now a part of that cartel's product mix. _x000D_
And they have gotten very good at producing high quality _x000D_
methamphetamine for less."
2926206,2926205,2926207,19241,18,"    Talk a little bit about routes and flow. _x000D_
I just kind of want to talk a little bit about the history now _x000D_
and how it really is like damming water, and it just kind of _x000D_
flows around, because 25, 30 years ago the flow was really out _x000D_
of Colombia, through the Caribbean, and then up through Miami; _x000D_
correct? And we did not stop it. Maybe we reduced the flow _x000D_
through there. But then we redirected the flow through Central _x000D_
America._x000D_
    And same thing's true, in our next panel we will be talking _x000D_
about the 1990 plan which really has not been updated. You shut _x000D_
down certain areas, and it just flows into other areas._x000D_
    Can somebody address where we are on that? And is that all _x000D_
we can really do is just redirect it to some other area and _x000D_
then destroy public institutions in some other area?"
2926207,2926206,2926208,19241,18,"    Well, I think when you talk specifically _x000D_
about this State, you look at our neighbors. California does _x000D_
have a wall. New Mexico has a mountain range. Texas has a _x000D_
river. Arizona's border situation is different. So in terms of _x000D_
the history and how that's affected the State over the course _x000D_
of decades, I will ask Colonel Milstead to comment."
2926208,2926207,2926209,19241,18,"    By the way, that is an extremely _x000D_
important point you made earlier, though, that after 9/11 we _x000D_
shut down our ports of entry. It really went a long way for _x000D_
drying up the supply, which tells you the reality of the _x000D_
situation: Most of these hard drugs are coming through our _x000D_
ports of entry, not being backpacked._x000D_
    Anybody else want to comment on that? I mean, that is an _x000D_
insight to me. That is extremely good testimony there."
2926209,2926208,2926210,19241,18,"    Mr. Chairman, the majority of our _x000D_
seizures of heroin are at the ports of entry, not between the _x000D_
ports of entry. But, most police chiefs are not really known _x000D_
for their optimism. But if you look at cocaine, our consumption _x000D_
of cocaine in this country since 2007 and 2008 is down by half. _x000D_
We have made significant improvements. The crack cocaine _x000D_
epidemic that we talked about in the late 1990s is really _x000D_
pretty much a thing of the past."
2926210,2926209,2926211,19241,18,"    Moved on to other drugs, methamphetamine _x000D_
and----"
2926211,2926210,2926212,19241,18,"    Well, methamphetamine has always _x000D_
been the lowest drug in drug use in the United States. The _x000D_
difficulty with methamphetamine is that it is very specific to _x000D_
geography. So a place like Arizona or Iowa or the West Coast _x000D_
can get hit very hard, devastatingly hard, with _x000D_
methamphetamine. If you go to New England, it is not that much _x000D_
of an issue._x000D_
    But when you approach this issue from this whole of _x000D_
government approach, which I think everybody here is talking _x000D_
about, I think cocaine would be a place where optimism, we _x000D_
could look toward heroin, working and doing the same kind of _x000D_
thing, reducing the demand, doing better interdiction, having _x000D_
better technology, but educating people about, as Colonel _x000D_
Milstead said, the dangers of drug use."
2926212,2926211,2926213,19241,18,    Yes.
2926213,2926212,2926214,19241,18,"    Thank you, Senator."
2926214,2926213,2926215,19241,18,    Senator Flake.
2926215,2926214,2926216,19241,18,"    Well, I want to say thank you, Senator _x000D_
Flake. And I want to say the beginning of this partnership with _x000D_
Commissioner Kerlikowske here has been the best first step._x000D_
    Step two is going to be around proper prosecution. But what _x000D_
we have found, I would say that the difference here is we are _x000D_
reaching out to these agencies, and we are talking about the _x000D_
needs of Arizona and the shared goals, not only about our _x000D_
State, but of the Nation._x000D_
    And I want to say how grateful I am to Commissioner _x000D_
Kerlikowske for his urgency on this matter. And I think we also _x000D_
have some excitement around the success we have in just 8 _x000D_
weeks, and what is possible afterwards."
2926216,2926215,2926217,19241,18,"    I just have two basic lines of _x000D_
questioning here._x000D_
    First of all, you go down to Central America. You see this _x000D_
drug problem having destroyed the public institutions in _x000D_
Central America. In testimony in the second panel, we are _x000D_
talking about the concern with all this money about potential _x000D_
corruption within our own institution._x000D_
    So I just want to ask your evaluation, how much corruption? _x000D_
How concerned are you? And just take it from there._x000D_
    We will start with you, Governor Ducey."
2926217,2926216,2926218,19241,18,"    Well, the last thing I want to do is paint _x000D_
our State as perfect, because no place is perfect. But this _x000D_
culture of corruption does not exist in the State of Arizona. _x000D_
In terms of what we are seeing across the border, again, I will _x000D_
defer to folks that have been around longer than I have been._x000D_
    But regardless of that situation, this idea that there is a _x000D_
fight that needs to be fought and that we need to bring _x000D_
resources to it and the best possible people at the highest _x000D_
level of ability and intelligence and sense of mission is going _x000D_
to be in the face of what is happening with these drug cartels _x000D_
and the amount of money that is sloshing through this system _x000D_
and destroying lives on this side of the border."
2926218,2926217,2926219,19241,18,"    First of all, that is good news._x000D_
    Colonel, do you want to offer any insights?"
2926219,2926218,2926220,19241,18,    Thank you. Commissioner.
2926220,2926219,2926221,19241,18,"    Mr. Chairman, 60,000 employees, I _x000D_
think, the corruption issue is a significant concern to me. And _x000D_
until August of last year, we did not have Internal Affairs, _x000D_
and what we had was anemic._x000D_
    Secretary Johnson gave me authority to build an Internal _x000D_
Affairs Unit with aggressive criminal investigators, and we are _x000D_
in the process of doing that. Given the amount of money and the _x000D_
drug issues, corruption is always a concern. It has me _x000D_
concerned every night."
2926221,2926220,2926222,19241,18,"    So let me close out again. Just trying to _x000D_
talk to you about, why do we have to secure our border? I mean, _x000D_
obviously we are talking about one of the problems. The root _x000D_
cause is the insatiable demand for drugs. We have to secure our _x000D_
borders for public health and safety. We also have to secure _x000D_
our border from a standpoint of an immigration system that _x000D_
works._x000D_
    We also have to secure our border--it is imperative to _x000D_
national security. When I was down in Honduras and touring with _x000D_
General Kelly, apparently this term has been around--I had _x000D_
never heard of it--I have always heard of Other Than Mexico _x000D_
(OTM). In hearings, we would say, well, those are the folks _x000D_
coming in from Central America._x000D_
    But when we were in Central America, they talked about _x000D_
special interest aliens (SIAs). Right now a lot of the special _x000D_
interest aliens are Cubans because of our, dry foot policies, _x000D_
driving people here that can get here. Cubans, they can stay. _x000D_
There is an incentive._x000D_
    But also included in that SIA category were Somalis, _x000D_
Pakistanis, and Syrians, and others._x000D_
    Can you speak to that? Again, to me that is a very large _x000D_
concern based on what we are seeing over in Syria and Iraq _x000D_
right now."
2926222,2926221,2926223,19241,18,"    So the term is for special _x000D_
interest aliens, those that have come from a country that could _x000D_
have problems with the United States. We apprehend every year _x000D_
people from well over 100 countries, whether it is on the _x000D_
Northern Border or whether it is on the southwest border. We _x000D_
turn those people in a very short period of time over to _x000D_
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for further work. But _x000D_
it is always a concern, and I work hard with ICE to make sure _x000D_
that they are fully vetted, and ICE works hard to make sure _x000D_
that they are detained."
2926223,2926222,2926224,19241,18,"    Anybody else providing insights, some _x000D_
data?_x000D_
    Senator McCain, do you want to make comment on that?_x000D_
    OK. Sure."
2926224,2926223,2926225,19241,18,"    Chairman Johnson, I know that within just a _x000D_
couple of years ago, I think 2012, Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security's own Statistics Bureau identified that along the _x000D_
southwest border, Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol _x000D_
has detained people from every single country of interest and _x000D_
every single State-sponsored terror country that is listed by _x000D_
the U.S. State Department. And this is ongoing. And that _x000D_
national security threat is critical._x000D_
    There has been testimony before Congress by the Acting _x000D_
Inspector General (IG) at DHS noting corruption issues with DHS _x000D_
border personnel and the link between drug trafficking _x000D_
organizations and terrorist organizations. It is in the public _x000D_
record."
2926225,2926224,2926226,19241,18,"    Thank you, Mr. Montgomery._x000D_
    Ready for the second panel. Again, I just want to thank all _x000D_
three of you gentlemen. First of all, your service to the _x000D_
community, your State, to our Nation. I really do appreciate _x000D_
you, Governor, in terms of making this a very high priority. It _x000D_
is a priority we share. We want to work very cooperatively with _x000D_
you. We have to solve this problem as a national issue. So, _x000D_
again, thank you for your thoughtful testimony and for your _x000D_
time._x000D_
    We will seat the next panel."
2926226,2926225,2926227,19241,18,"    Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Senators._x000D_
    (Applause.)"
2926227,2926226,2926228,19241,18,"    Will the next panel please be seated._x000D_

2926233,2926232,2926234,19241,18,"    Good morning. And thank you for this opportunity _x000D_
to appear before you, Chairman Johnson, Senator McCain, and _x000D_
Senator Flake._x000D_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    It is my privilege to address you today on behalf of the _x000D_
Arizona High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Executive Board _x000D_
concerning law enforcement efforts to combat illicit narcotic _x000D_
drug trafficking._x000D_
    The Arizona HIDTA region is just over 64,000 square miles. _x000D_
It includes 372 miles of contiguous international border with _x000D_
Sonora, Mexico. The international border area consists of _x000D_
inhospitable desert valleys and rugged mountainous terrain, _x000D_
which are ideal for drug smuggling._x000D_
    Due to Arizona's geographical location and shared border _x000D_
with Mexico, all of its highways and roadways are exploited by _x000D_
Mexican drug trafficking organizations to transport large _x000D_
quantities of illicit drugs._x000D_
    Each year the Arizona HIDTA conducts a comprehensive _x000D_
intelligence study to identify new and continuing trends in the _x000D_
Arizona region._x000D_
    The most recent threat assessment found that the Sinaloa _x000D_
Cartel continues to present the primary operational threat to _x000D_
Arizona, with vast resources to source, distribute, transport, _x000D_
and smuggle large amounts of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and _x000D_
methamphetamine, in and through Arizona, to drug networks _x000D_
throughout the United States._x000D_
    A significant number of drugs seized in other States have _x000D_
been linked to Arizona, which demonstrates how vital Arizona is _x000D_
to Mexican drug organizations. After methamphetamine, heroin is _x000D_
the greatest threat in the Arizona HIDTA region. The abundance _x000D_
of heroin in Arizona is directly correlated to the high levels _x000D_
of opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico._x000D_
    The number of Arizona HIDTA investigations with heroin _x000D_
seizures increased 161 percent from 2011 to 2015. Many of the _x000D_
investigations are international, multi-state, and multi-_x000D_
jurisdictional in scope._x000D_
    Law enforcement operations that successfully disrupt and/or _x000D_
dismantle Arizona-based organizations directly impact the _x000D_
availability, price, and purity of heroin and other U.S. drug _x000D_
markets. Seizing the opportunity to profit from the growing _x000D_
appetite for heroin, stemming from the prescription drug _x000D_
epidemic, the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican drug _x000D_
organizations have adapted to meet the growing demand by _x000D_
producing, smuggling, transporting, and distributing wholesale _x000D_
quantities of Mexican white, brown powder, and black tar heroin _x000D_
to expanding northeast, midwest, southeast, and northwest _x000D_
markets through Arizona-based trafficking networks at _x000D_
unprecedented levels._x000D_
    The Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican drug organizations _x000D_
have diversified heroin production to produce white heroin to _x000D_
increase their market share in emerging and existing heroin _x000D_
markets. Historically, heroin users in the East Coast cities _x000D_
have preferred white heroin over Mexican tar heroin._x000D_
    Chronic abuse of prescription opioid drugs, such as _x000D_
OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin, creates a gateway for heroin _x000D_
addiction. Research indicates prescription opioid abusers _x000D_
between the ages of 12 and 49 are 19 times more likely to _x000D_
engage in heroin use than their counterparts with no history of _x000D_
prescription opioid abuse._x000D_
    The transition from prescription opioid abuse to heroin _x000D_
occurs most often among youths age 12 to 17, with a transition _x000D_
to heroin occurring within an average of 17 months._x000D_
    Preventing prescription drug misuse and abuse is essential _x000D_
to reduce the number of lives lost and those addicted to _x000D_
prescription drugs and heroin._x000D_
    The Arizona HIDTA, in collaboration with State and local _x000D_
agencies, is expanding its prescription misuse and abuse _x000D_
initiative to all counties in the Arizona HIDTA region. In the _x000D_
pilot counties, the number of deaths from opiate drug overdoses _x000D_
decreased 28 percent while the non-pilot counties' deaths _x000D_
increased._x000D_
    The Arizona HIDTA has also launched a Stronger Together _x000D_
prevention initiative bringing together law enforcement and _x000D_
community substance abuse prevention coalitions with a central _x000D_
goal of reducing substance abuse and is in the process of _x000D_
developing a Native American and Spanish language prevention _x000D_
tool to fill those gaps._x000D_
    Coordination through shared intelligence is critical to _x000D_
combating the tremendous threat posed by the Sinaloa Cartel and _x000D_
Mexican drug organizations. Under the coordination umbrella of _x000D_
the Arizona HIDTA, participating law enforcement agencies _x000D_
eliminate duplicative operational and investigative programs _x000D_
and facilitate tactical, operational, and strategic _x000D_
intelligence sharing._x000D_
    The Arizona HIDTA approach to intelligence training, _x000D_
information sharing, and demand reduction demonstrates that as _x000D_
traditional organizational barriers are overcome, law _x000D_
enforcement entities can better focus investigative and _x000D_
intelligence resources on dismantling and disrupting the most _x000D_
dangerous and prolific drug trafficking organizations._x000D_
    The Arizona HIDTA remains committed to facilitating _x000D_
cooperation among law enforcement entities and to supporting _x000D_
coordinated law enforcement efforts to combat Arizona-based _x000D_
drug organizations._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today _x000D_
and for the Subcommittee's continued support of the HIDTA _x000D_
program."
2926234,2926233,2926235,19241,18,"    Thank you, Ms. Mertz._x000D_
    Our next witness is Brandon Judd. Brandon Judd is a Border _x000D_
Patrol agent and serves as the President of the National Border _x000D_

    Agent Judd. Senator Johnson, thank you very much, Senator _x000D_
McCain, Senator Flake, I appreciate the opportunity._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Judd appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 2026._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    On August 26, 2015, the DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro _x000D_
Mayorkas was in the State of Montana to take a hard look at the _x000D_
organized illegal smuggling problems with narcotics in the _x000D_
Havre Border Patrol Area of Responsibility to the back-end oil _x000D_
fields located in Montana and North Dakota. Mr. Mayorkas was _x000D_
made aware of the smuggling due to the diligence of various _x000D_
local law enforcement entities._x000D_
    During his visit, Mr. Mayorkas met with several law _x000D_
enforcement agencies as well as with me and a few other _x000D_
officers of both the National Border Patrol Council and the _x000D_
National Treasurer Employees Union (NTEU). Although I represent _x000D_
the men and women of the Border Patrol in the capacity of a _x000D_
labor leader, I am also a Border Patrol agent extremely _x000D_
concerned about the security of our nation's border. My _x000D_
members, who are your agents, are also genuinely concerned _x000D_
about the security of our borders. Therefore, at the meeting _x000D_
and on their behalf, I raised three issues:_x000D_
    First, the lack of actionable intelligence provided to _x000D_
agents to allow them to be successful._x000D_
    Second, the releasing of criminal aliens from Mexico who _x000D_
are in our custody._x000D_
    And third, the practice of providing overtime to managers _x000D_
to sit behind a desk as opposed to field agents performing _x000D_
enforcement duties._x000D_
    For the purpose of this hearing, I will confine my comments _x000D_
to the lack of intelligence and its impacts on Border Patrol _x000D_
and Border Patrol's operations. Simply put, Border Patrol _x000D_
agents are not being given the intelligence necessary to be _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    How can a Border Patrol agent know smuggling is taking _x000D_
place, let alone do their job, if they are not given the _x000D_
necessary intelligence? To date and even though this issue was _x000D_
brought directly to Deputy Secretary Mayorkas's attention 2 _x000D_
months ago, Border Patrol agents in Montana still have not been _x000D_
given the intelligence necessary for them to interdict the _x000D_
narcotics being smuggled through their Area of Responsibility._x000D_
    Please allow me to give the committee two examples of how _x000D_
this is impacting our operations. When Customs and Border _x000D_
Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske became aware of this _x000D_
hearing, he hastily put together an operation aimed at _x000D_
interdicting heroin coming from Mexico into the United States._x000D_
    This operation is now in the fourth week of four, and it _x000D_
has been a complete failure. I personally spoke to the agents _x000D_
participating in this operation and asked the following _x000D_
questions:_x000D_
    Were you given any idea of how this operation could be a _x000D_
success?_x000D_
    Were you given any intelligence that would help you be _x000D_
successful?_x000D_
    Were you given any training on how to conduct the _x000D_
operation?_x000D_
    Were you given any intelligence specific to heroin _x000D_
smuggling?_x000D_
    As a Border Patrol agent, are you familiar with or have _x000D_
ever worked at a port of entry?_x000D_
    Were you trained on how to work at a port of entry?_x000D_
    Are you aware that this operation is not only to seize _x000D_
heroin, but also to gather intelligence?_x000D_
    Do you know of any heroin that was seized during this _x000D_
operation?_x000D_
    Do you feel this operation was properly planned and _x000D_
communicated to the agents assigned?_x000D_
    And last, and most important, as per the stated purpose, do _x000D_
you feel this operation was a success?_x000D_
    To every single one of those questions, those agents _x000D_
answered no. Not one of those did they answer in the _x000D_
affirmative except for one K-9 handler who was formerly an _x000D_
Office of Field Operations (OFO) officer that worked for the _x000D_
port of entry that knew what the port of entry's _x000D_
responsibilities were._x000D_
    I would also like to give you another example. On February _x000D_
23, 2015, a Bisbee, Arizona, police officer made a routine _x000D_
traffic stop on a U-Haul moving truck. During the stop and _x000D_
while speaking with the driver, the officer developed enough _x000D_
suspicion to call for a Border Patrol K-9 Handler nine to _x000D_
conduct a free-air sniff around the truck. While walking around _x000D_
the truck the canine alerted to the presence of a controlled _x000D_
substance or persons inside the locked storage unit of the _x000D_
truck._x000D_
    Several thousands of pounds of marijuana were discovered _x000D_
inside the truck, and it was later determined that the truck _x000D_
came from a home in Naco, Arizona. A subsequent search warrant _x000D_
was obtained and in the early morning of February 24, 2015, a _x000D_
tunnel was found on the property of the home. It is estimated _x000D_
the tunnel was used for several years prior to discovery._x000D_
    I would like to point out, because Sheriff Dannels is here, _x000D_
the only reason we knew that that truck came from a home in _x000D_
Naco, Arizona, was because one of his deputy sheriffs reported _x000D_
to the scene and said, ``Hey, I saw that truck at this home,'' _x000D_
which allowed us to get the warrant to search that home._x000D_
    This was great police work, and all officers and agents _x000D_
involved should be commended. It is, however, a complete _x000D_
breakdown of the intelligence cycle. Prior to writing this _x000D_
testimony, I spoke with three of my former colleagues at the _x000D_
Brian Terry Memorial Station. This station is assigned to the _x000D_
area where the tunnel was found, and all three were absolutely _x000D_
amazed that a cartel was able to run contraband directly under _x000D_
the nose of several agents for so long._x000D_
    How serious is the lack of intelligence? It is very _x000D_
serious. But candidly, heroin is the least of our worries. Last _x000D_
week five Pakistani nationals and two Afghan nationals were _x000D_
arrested by Border Patrol agents in Sonoita, Arizona, in the _x000D_
Sonoita, Arizona, Area of Responsibility._x000D_
    What can we do better? We are dealing with highly _x000D_
sophisticated, well-organized criminal cartels. As the HIDTA _x000D_
report notes, these cartels employ encrypted communications and _x000D_
hire transportation networks and hundreds of cartel members on _x000D_
this side of the border._x000D_
    Do we need to support local law enforcement agencies like _x000D_
the Cochise County Sheriff's Department? The answer is _x000D_
absolutely. When Federal agencies work and support local law _x000D_
enforcement, our effectiveness increases exponentially._x000D_
    Will Joint Agency Task Forces make a difference? Without a _x000D_
doubt. They will have a positive impact. Joint Agency Task _x000D_
Forces not only increase our effectiveness in arresting _x000D_
criminals and seizing contraband, they increase the probability _x000D_
of gathering the necessary intelligence to support the men and _x000D_
women in the field._x000D_
    Can the Border Patrol be successful without actionable _x000D_
intelligence that is disseminated to the field agents? The _x000D_
answer is an emphatic no. We must take a proactive instead of a _x000D_
reactive approach to combating crime. Intelligence is the only _x000D_
way we will be able to predict when, where, and how persons or _x000D_
contraband will illegally enter our country._x000D_
    I appreciate this time to testify before you and look _x000D_
forward to answering any questions you have."
2926235,2926234,2926236,19241,18,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the _x000D_
Committee._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Taylor appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 2029._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As you just heard, my name is Jeff Taylor, and I will be _x000D_
presenting the many effects drug addiction has on our State. My _x000D_
personal experiences on what works and where to go from here._x000D_
    Briefly, I grew up in Phoenix and attended Central High _x000D_
School with Senator McCain's wife and also with Colonel _x000D_
Milstead who was on the panel earlier._x000D_
    My junior and senior year, I achieved a 4.0 grade point _x000D_
average (GPA) in advance placement (AP) classes. My senior _x000D_
year, I was selected as a first team all-State football player _x000D_
and all-city baseball player, and then attended the University _x000D_
of Arizona to play football and study finance._x000D_
    After college I was employed as a stock options trader for _x000D_
a prestigious Wall Street firm. And at the age of 29, I left _x000D_
the business at the absolutely peak of my career as one of the _x000D_
firm's top traders._x000D_
    I came from a good family, had a successful and meaningful _x000D_
work history, participated in varied philanthropic works, and _x000D_
had acquired much as symbols of financial and success. I mean, _x000D_
everything that we gauge in this country for success, I had._x000D_
    Four years after leaving the trading position, I was living _x000D_
on the streets of Phoenix. I had lost everything to addiction. _x000D_
It can happen to anyone. My story is not unusual._x000D_
    Early on in college I received a career-ending football _x000D_
injury and was prescribed a narcotic pain medication. My first _x000D_
experience with narcotics came from a doctor. Actually, I had _x000D_
one other really bad experience in high school with Boone's _x000D_
Farm Strawberry Hill. That was enough for me. But I was not a _x000D_
drinker. I did not smoke weed in high school. I was a normal, _x000D_
good kid._x000D_
    As a result of my addiction, I have been incarcerated many _x000D_
times in numerous county jails and State prison. This does not _x000D_
make me a bad person. It makes me an addict in need of help. We _x000D_
have a sheriff here that runs one of the toughest county jails _x000D_
in the country, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. As I have told him many _x000D_
times, he tries to make our facilities very tough that you do _x000D_
not want to go back. And we agree. We do not want people going _x000D_
back. But I have told him, that his jail is so tough, I have _x000D_
only been back six times. That is the power of addiction._x000D_
    Facing a 4 to 6 year prison term, a very wise judge _x000D_
diverted me to The Salvation Army drug treatment facility. It _x000D_
is 20 years later, and I am still very grateful for that. My _x000D_
drug treatment cost $6,000. My prison term would have cost _x000D_
$100,000, and statistics show I would likely be back._x000D_
    You have asked me to share what I have learned from my _x000D_
unique perspective. First of all, I agree wholeheartedly with _x000D_
Senator McCain. We cannot incarcerate our way out of addiction _x000D_
alone. Our State population has doubled. During the same _x000D_
timeframe our prison population in the State of Arizona has _x000D_
gone up 1196 percent. People are released with the same drug _x000D_
problem they were arrested with._x000D_
    And we prove this by our high rate of re-arrest. And what _x000D_
is worse when addicts are all placed together in a prison _x000D_
environment, they network and pick up new skills. While _x000D_
incarcerated, I learned how to manufacture crystal _x000D_
methamphetamine, a lot about identity theft, how to import and _x000D_
transport drugs and avoid canine detection, and was introduced _x000D_
to several high-ranking drug cartel members, all while on a _x000D_
prison yard._x000D_
    Arizona Department of Corrections just reported of the _x000D_
nearly 20,000 inmates we will release next year, 77 percent are _x000D_
in need of substance abuse treatment. I cannot emphasize the _x000D_
following statement enough: We do not have a prison expansion _x000D_
problem. We have a drug problem._x000D_
    You will never hear me complain about the time I served in _x000D_
jails and prisons. I was a danger to myself and others. Addicts _x000D_
understand consequences. But for me, there was a back door to _x000D_
that prison cell. I received what I needed, a transitional drug _x000D_
treatment program._x000D_
    That experience has led me to work with several legislators _x000D_
over the years to develop one of the most successful prison _x000D_
transition programs nationally. And if there is one sentence _x000D_
that I would like the panel to hear today, it is this: This _x000D_
program has reduced crime committed by those released from _x000D_
prison by 50 percent. This is not measuring in a month. This is _x000D_
measuring at 3 years and tracking over a thousand inmates._x000D_
    This program saves taxpayer money, a lot of money, and _x000D_
increases public safety. So let us work on the not-going-back _x000D_
part._x000D_
    As a result of the increased flow of drugs into Arizona and _x000D_
addiction rate soaring, our State Department of Child Safety _x000D_
(DCS) is under pressure from the wreckage caused by addictive _x000D_
parents. Our system is overburdened in the sheer numbers of _x000D_
child abuse and neglect cases, yet nearly 90 percent of DCS _x000D_
caseloads are addicted to drugs and/or alcohol, one or both _x000D_
parents._x000D_
    We do not have a child abuse and neglect problem. Again, we _x000D_
have a drug problem._x000D_
    I know this, because after graduating the drug treatment _x000D_
program, The Salvation Army sent me back to college to study _x000D_
early childhood development to design and administer the first _x000D_
nursery of its type: A State licensed childcare facility _x000D_
serving children of drug addicted parents._x000D_
    The program was very successful. Of the 27 women that were _x000D_
released pregnant, drug addicted from Sheriff Joe's jail, 96 _x000D_
percent of these pregnant women delivered a drug-free baby. _x000D_
These mothers could receive residential drug treatment while _x000D_
their children were monitored and kept safe. Often child _x000D_
removal is absolutely necessary, but we must not throw away the _x000D_
parent who is addicted as they will have more kids that we can _x000D_
take away. We need to stop the cycle of addiction._x000D_
    As high schoolers we all remember going to parties, and _x000D_
there was always someone outside getting sick in the bushes _x000D_
after drinking too much. Teens overdo it. They always have. But _x000D_
if you overdo it with heroin, it kills._x000D_
    Currently opiate overdoses account for more teen deaths _x000D_
than auto accidents. The bigger question is: Why are our teens _x000D_
altering reality in such an extreme way? And then I was _x000D_
introduced to a very effective education and prevention program _x000D_
called ``Not My Kid.''_x000D_
    The title really says it all. Most parents today are caught _x000D_
off guard by their children's drug use and are in desperate _x000D_
need to help navigate these difficult parenting challenges. Not _x000D_
My Kid understands that teens listen to teens, and that they _x000D_
have been extremely successful in areas of drug abuse, _x000D_
education, and prevention in our schools in a simple-to-_x000D_
understand, right-and-wrong model. This program needs to be _x000D_
expanded and replicated in other States._x000D_
    My son thanks The Salvation Army and the criminal justice _x000D_
system for saving his dad's life. It took both working _x000D_
together. My son does not know his dad to be under the _x000D_
influence of drugs. He has never visited his father in prison. _x000D_
And he has never been in foster care. And now at 16, he is _x000D_
definitely not enjoying how involved his dad is in his life _x000D_
right now._x000D_
    I am very much enjoying my role as an involved parent just _x000D_
as God designed me to be. Thank you."
2926236,2926235,2926237,19241,18,"    Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for sharing your _x000D_
story and for what you are doing._x000D_
    Can you just describe a little bit in greater detail the _x000D_
program that works so phenomenally well?"
2926237,2926236,2926238,19241,18,"    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, we give _x000D_
a Band-Aid mainly to people that are suffering from addiction. _x000D_
In other words, if you are losing your children as a result of _x000D_
addiction, that means that you are far along in your addiction. _x000D_
Addiction progresses over time._x000D_
    So by the time that it is either go to prison or you have _x000D_
been to prison, is that we then send them to a 1-or 2-day _x000D_
class. What really works--and Salvation Army has been doing _x000D_
this for over 150 years. The Salvation Army started in the _x000D_
streets of London in 1865 to handle alcoholics on the streets _x000D_
of London._x000D_
    So we have learned a lot in those years. We feel that long-_x000D_
term residential drug treatment is the most effective. You add _x000D_
the faith-based component to that. And we do not require that _x000D_
anyone believe, the Christian model. If you are a Jewish client _x000D_
of ours, then we will take you to a Jewish temple. If you are--_x000D_
we even had a devil worshiper come through, and The Salvation _x000D_
Army officer stood up and said, ``We love devil worshipers.'' _x000D_
We can not dictate how people believe, but we can treat it as _x000D_
the health issue that it is. We get people healthy, their days _x000D_
into days, their nights into nights. We have good nutrition. _x000D_
They go to work every day._x000D_
    All of the trucks that you see driving around town that are _x000D_
Salvation Army trucks, they are in our drug treatment program. _x000D_
So they are earning that treatment bed. And incidentally, the _x000D_
model does not accept nor seek any government funding. It is _x000D_
self-supporting. It is a long-term residential treatment, 6 _x000D_
months with transition."
2926238,2926237,2926239,19241,18,"    Now, Jeff----"
2926239,2926238,2926240,19241,18,    Only as good as your transition. Excuse me.
2926240,2926239,2926241,19241,18,"    Jeff, is the program working in prisons?"
2926241,2926240,2926242,19241,18,"    The program that we have in the prison is _x000D_
actually not in the prison. Drug treatment in a prison _x000D_
environment is not nearly as effective as drug treatment out of _x000D_
the prison environment._x000D_
    So briefly, this program releases inmates 90 days early. It _x000D_
is only a 90-day early release, so there's no sentencing reform _x000D_
involved. And during those 90 days, that individual is in a _x000D_
highly monitored drug treatment program, but it is also case _x000D_
managed, meaning that that person is enrolled in parenting _x000D_
classes, safe housing, everything that you need when you get _x000D_
out._x000D_
    I have been released from our prison system with $42 in my _x000D_
pocket, homeless, and with a felony conviction. And now it is _x000D_
like: Now, do not go back. Of course, people are going to go _x000D_
back._x000D_
    So that program is called intensive outpatient and, quite _x000D_
frankly, it has been much more successful than I thought it _x000D_
would be."
2926242,2926241,2926243,19241,18,"    I met with former prisoners in Wisconsin, _x000D_
too, and we make it almost impossible for them to succeed once _x000D_
they leave._x000D_
    While we are still talking about this subject, Senator _x000D_
McCain, Senator Flake, any questions for Mr. Taylor?"
2926243,2926242,2926244,19241,18,"    I did not get addicted--Senator Flake, excuse _x000D_
me._x000D_
    I did not get addicted right away. At that time, I was a _x000D_
pre-med student. I was worried about getting behind in school, _x000D_
and then I took a narcotic pain medication that was prescribed, _x000D_
and all of a sudden, I did not worry. It is called having a _x000D_
false sense of well-being._x000D_
    And I did not get addicted in college. It is when I got out _x000D_
of college. But that part in my brain, that was the fix to high _x000D_
anxiety or things that I worry about. And then I became a stock _x000D_
options trader which, as we all know, is a highly stressful _x000D_
business._x000D_
    Most addicts are people that do not have an off switch. I _x000D_
just do not have an off switch. So what I had to learn in _x000D_
treatment is how to take that excessiveness and turn it in the _x000D_
right direction. For example, the other day I woke up, and I _x000D_
got on my bike and I rode to Prescott. That is a little _x000D_
healthier, though. It is downhill coming back, though."
2926244,2926243,2926245,19241,18,    Sure. Go ahead.
2926245,2926244,2926246,19241,18,"    It gets hot. But ours is a humid hot, _x000D_
too._x000D_
    No. Listen, when you hear about the high levels of _x000D_
unemployment once the finest among us that, veterans coming _x000D_
back from Afghanistan and Iraq, and then to hear jobs are not _x000D_
being filled, it seems like it is a pretty common sense _x000D_
solution._x000D_
    Agent Judd, it is disturbing that you have talked about _x000D_
these documented cases that are not acted upon. We have had a _x000D_
number of hearings on retribution. Not only just within _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security, but across the Federal _x000D_
Government. Coming from the private sector, I just find it _x000D_
shocking how much retribution there really is against _x000D_
whistleblowers._x000D_
    Is that part of the problem why the agents do not continue _x000D_
to followup on their accusations? Have they experienced _x000D_
retribution? Do they fear it?_x000D_
    Agent Judd. Yes. If you look at the most recent reports, _x000D_
especially about the Afghanistan and Pakistanis that were just _x000D_
arrested here in Arizona, and you talk about the Syrians that _x000D_
are giving up at the port of entry, all of these news outlets _x000D_
are saying from sources that do not want to be named._x000D_
    Well, there is a reason why they do not want to be named._x000D_
    If they are named, they know darn good and well that they _x000D_
are going to face repercussions from the agency. And it is _x000D_
known that this agency will take action against agents. We just _x000D_
had an agent, Chris Cabrera, who testified before your _x000D_
committee."
2926246,2926245,2926247,19241,18,"    I was going to point out that agent._x000D_
    Agent Judd. And right after his testimony, Internal Affairs _x000D_
wanted to investigate him because he is telling you what is _x000D_
happening on the border. And I am sorry, Senator. I just had _x000D_
one of my local presidents was just proposed termination for _x000D_
absolutely--it's ridiculous what this proposed termination is _x000D_
for. So, yes, we have a lot of problems within our agency as _x000D_
far as them taking action when we come up and we give them _x000D_
commonsense approaches to effectuating law enforcement _x000D_
activities._x000D_
    Senator, you have heard me many times, although I am _x000D_
elected to be in the National Border Patrol Council, you know _x000D_
darn good and well that the National Border Patrol Council's--_x000D_
our concern is border security. Always has been. Always will _x000D_
be."
2926247,2926246,2926248,19241,18,"    It was interesting that that exact same _x000D_
instance of Chris Cabrera, we heard prior to our hearing that _x000D_
he was going to have an interview with Internal Affairs. And, _x000D_
of course, I will put the best structure on it. I was assuming _x000D_
that Internal Affairs was going to ask him about the disparity _x000D_
in his testimony that we were only apprehending 30 to 40 _x000D_
percent. He probably wanted to get to the bottom of that. I _x000D_
raised that issue in the hearing, and the interview was _x000D_
canceled._x000D_
    Agent Judd. Yes, it was, and I appreciate that."
2926248,2926247,2926249,19241,18,"    Which kind of tells me they were not _x000D_
going to talk about their concern about a lower apprehension _x000D_
rate and cooking the books basically in terms of information _x000D_
they were provided._x000D_
    Agent Judd. Yes."
2926249,2926248,2926250,19241,18,    Senator Flake.
2926250,2926249,2926251,19241,18,"    In answer to that question, yes, it does. As _x000D_
technology increases, we encounter encrypted phone-to-phone _x000D_
transmissions. We are having difficulty un-encrypting them. We _x000D_
can not do it. And as technology increases, our ability to _x000D_
conduct these long-term investigations and figure out what they _x000D_
are doing becomes more and more difficult."
2926251,2926250,2926252,19241,18,"    Thank you, Senator Flake. We are rapidly _x000D_
running out of time. I did want to follow up just quickly on _x000D_
the 1990s plan."
2926252,2926251,2926253,19241,18,"    I started my questioning with the _x000D_
Governor and the Commissioner really talking about what are the _x000D_
top three things, actions. OK. Cooperation, funding, got that. _x000D_
But to cooperate and fund what?_x000D_
    I want to go to the 1990s plan. We did succeed in _x000D_
dramatically reducing flow of drugs and illegal trafficking in _x000D_
different sectors; correct?_x000D_
    Can you just tell me, what did we do that worked? And, _x000D_
obviously, we have redirected now. They have cracked the code _x000D_
and figured out how to smuggle elsewhere. But talk about what _x000D_
worked to guide our activity in terms of what we need to do _x000D_
now._x000D_
    Sheriff Dannels. Chairman Johnson, I will start by saying _x000D_
it is got to have the will. Washington, D.C., has to have the _x000D_
will to change it. We can not settle on the fact that, hey, we _x000D_
have had successes in the three metro cities on the southwest _x000D_
border: El Paso, Yuma, and San Diego._x000D_
    And I use this analogy when I talk to groups and the fact _x000D_
that 20 years ago when you turned on one of the three major _x000D_
networks, and you would see a pursuit heading north from the _x000D_
border, whether it be a Border Patrol chasing a motor vehicle, _x000D_
a sheriff's office, and then you would see folks bailing out of _x000D_
the pickup. Ask yourself: When is the last time you saw that? _x000D_
Probably has not been much because the agency has been _x000D_
addressed with staffing, technology, attention all the way _x000D_
through intel sharing at a Federal level._x000D_
    You need to take successes and say, hey, this has worked in _x000D_
these metro areas, and we have done it. Take that because what _x000D_
you have done is taken that illegal, those violent cartels, and _x000D_
you have pretty much given up the rural parts of the southwest _x000D_
border to let them operate in that area to bring across _x000D_
special--like Brandon Judd was talking about this tunnel that I _x000D_
was involved with also with them. And that is a VIP tunnel. I _x000D_
testified before on that, where special products, special _x000D_
people came through that. That should scare the heck out of all _x000D_
of us in this room._x000D_
    And so we need to put a huge effort on redefining this plan _x000D_
of the 1990s and go back and see what history has taught us and _x000D_
take that forward."
2926253,2926252,2926254,19241,18,"    Again, I want to talk about what we can _x000D_
do. So we need the will, commitment, no doubt about it. We need _x000D_
cooperation. We need funding to do what?_x000D_
    What is it? Talk about technology. Now, is it fencing?_x000D_
    Is it more manpower? I mean, what is it that we have to do?_x000D_
    Sheriff Dannels. If I can answer that, Chairman Johnson, is _x000D_
one thing we do in our county that I think, all sheriffs and _x000D_
all police chiefs on the local level do different things to max _x000D_
their community needs, is to actually speak to a variety of _x000D_
chiefs and sheriffs and say what is working in your county on _x000D_
the southwest border?_x000D_
    There is 24 of us sheriffs, for example, and each one is _x000D_
doing their own thing to make things work. We need to unify on _x000D_
that, first of all, and make sure that that voice is heard from _x000D_
the sheriffs and to our State partners and our Federal _x000D_
partners._x000D_
    The other aspect of this is, I use a balanced approach of _x000D_
education, prevention and enforcement. And each one has a _x000D_
certain element to address a certain population of your _x000D_
citizenry._x000D_
    No. 1 is if you look at 66 percent of what we do is _x000D_
education prevention, and you have that 33 percent for those _x000D_
that just will not comply that we have to have that enforcement _x000D_
consequence rule built into our laws._x000D_
    So how can I say this? You really need to listen to your _x000D_
locals. Because as you solve problems as in anything you are _x000D_
doing in life, you always go to the lowest levels. And that _x000D_
needs to start in our communities with our agents."
2926254,2926253,2926255,19241,18,"    There are always different solutions to _x000D_
different parts. Again, very quickly, Ms. Mertz, Mr. Judd, Mr. _x000D_
Taylor, I know you want one final comment. Ms. Mertz."
2926255,2926254,2926256,19241,18,"    I do think increasing our ability to use _x000D_
technology as far as the encrypted phone transmissions would _x000D_
assist us._x000D_
    I agree with what Sheriff Dannels said: Use the information _x000D_
from the sheriffs' departments, the police departments, and _x000D_
roll that up into a bigger investigation, and use the _x000D_
intelligence to ensure that you are targeting the correct _x000D_
people._x000D_
    And then the task forces can go after those people, and we _x000D_
can enforce our laws, also reducing the demand in our country _x000D_
for the illicit drugs."
2926256,2926255,2926257,19241,18,"    Has there ever been a meeting of all the _x000D_
county sheriffs, by DHS to really find out what action plan we _x000D_
have to do? And you have to do it quick._x000D_
    Sheriff Dannels. Yes. And I can answer that question. I _x000D_
know the four border sheriffs in Arizona, we recently met and _x000D_
discussed issues. I know Southwest Border Sheriffs, the Western _x000D_
Sheriffs Association, National Sheriffs Association, we just _x000D_
had a conference in Sierra Vista, Arizona, where we brought us _x000D_
all together and talked about what we are talking about today._x000D_
    So we are trying to unify our thoughts and put that balance _x000D_
of what we are doing and how to make it best for the people we _x000D_
serve."
2926257,2926256,2926258,19241,18,"    Maybe this committee can convene _x000D_
something like that. Keep that in mind. Mr. Judd._x000D_
    Agent Judd. I will keep it very short._x000D_
    We need to develop, increase, and expand our intel._x000D_
    We need to be able to predict when, where, and how illegal _x000D_
narcotics, persons are going to cross our border._x000D_
    And we need to put our uniform law enforcement officers and _x000D_
agents in a position where they can be successful. That is what _x000D_
we need."
2926258,2926257,2926259,19241,18,"    Is that Homeland Security Investigations _x000D_
(HSI) within DHS? Is that separate----_x000D_
    Agent Judd. It is actually----"
2926259,2926258,2926260,19241,18,"    FBI?_x000D_
    Agent Judd. Well, FBI, HSI, Internal Affairs included._x000D_
    But these task forces are huge. When we shut down a task _x000D_
force because a task force is too successful we have to stop _x000D_
politicizing the issue. When we shut down a task force because _x000D_
the task force was extremely effective, which then shows that _x000D_
our ports of entry were not effective, that is just wrong."
2926260,2926259,2926261,19241,18,"    Mr. Taylor, why don't you close it out."
2926261,2926260,2926262,19241,18,"    And to Senator McCain's point on corruption, _x000D_
what I did not say in my statement today is I lived in Nogales. _x000D_
I lived right above the Mariposa exit and entry into this _x000D_
country and have been all up and down the border there._x000D_
    The major cartel members do not try to corrupt. They are _x000D_
amateurs that are trying to corrupt our government officials. _x000D_
They always get caught. Maybe they get caught now; maybe they _x000D_
get caught a year from now. But when they get caught, then that _x000D_
is going to bring all sorts of heat that the cartel members do _x000D_
not want brought into their area there. So it is much easier to _x000D_
throw a lot of product at the border, because they are very _x000D_
sophisticated in that. They know how much they throw at the _x000D_
border and how much is getting caught._x000D_
    So widespread corruption is highly publicized when one of _x000D_
our people are corrupt. But the corruption that is widespread _x000D_
is not on our side of the border._x000D_
    And then what we need to do is that drug addicts do not _x000D_
make great criminals. They get caught. We have got 20,000 that _x000D_
are getting out this year. That means 10,000 are going to be _x000D_
back in within 5 years. So when they get treatment, they do not _x000D_
go back._x000D_
    I do not buy drugs. It is pretty hard to do a drug-_x000D_
motivated crime when you do not do drugs. It is pretty hard to _x000D_
get a driving while intoxicated (DWI) if I am not intoxicated._x000D_
    So we have put a lot of money in interdiction, and yet _x000D_
drugs have never been more available, more plentiful, more _x000D_
powerful, and cheaper than they are at this very moment. We _x000D_
have to work on the demand side, and it works. We are getting _x000D_
very good at it."
2926262,2926261,2926263,19241,18,"    Again, Mr. Taylor, thank you._x000D_
    Thank all of our witnesses again for your service to your _x000D_
community, State, and nation, for your thoughtful testimony, _x000D_
your questions, and your answers to our questions._x000D_
    I want to thank Senator McCain, Senator Flake, and the _x000D_
State of Arizona, the Governor, for welcoming us here._x000D_
    This has really been a very good hearing. We have learned a _x000D_
lot, laid out more reality._x000D_
    With that, the hearing record will remain open for 15 days _x000D_
until December 8, 5 p.m., for the submissions of statements and _x000D_
questions for the record. This hearing is adjourned."
2926263,2926262,2926264,19242,1,"    Good morning. This hearing will come to _x000D_
order. I certainly want to thank all of the witnesses for _x000D_
taking the time to attend and for taking the time to write your _x000D_
thoughtful testimonies. We appreciate it. It will all be in the _x000D_
record._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 37._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    This is an important hearing. I guess I would consider this _x000D_
our second hearing on this subject. We had Governor Tom Ridge _x000D_
and Senator Joe Lieberman here, earlier, with their Blue Ribbon _x000D_
Study Panel on Biodefense, which is a very well-thought-out _x000D_
document with a lot of detail. Probably the main takeaway from _x000D_
that was the fact that we just have no central authority to _x000D_
kind of accumulate all of the data, to accumulate the budgets, _x000D_
and really to direct potential activity--particularly in the _x000D_
event of a significant outbreak, whether it is--and, of course, _x000D_
we have dealt with Ebola and avian influenza. We have had _x000D_
hearings on both of those--and, now, the Zika virus._x000D_
    In Wisconsin, we have something--and I cannot pronounce _x000D_
it--Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. I think I might have _x000D_
actually gotten that right. It has infected about 59 people, _x000D_
already 18 people in our State. I appreciate the work the _x000D_
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has already _x000D_
done on that, responding very quickly to a letter I sent. It _x000D_
sounds like you have really taken that very seriously and have _x000D_
been trying to find the common cause. Very interesting, I _x000D_
guess. Troubling in many respects, but, anyway, this is an _x000D_
important hearing._x000D_
    I do ask consent that my opening written statement be _x000D_
entered in the record. But, as with any hearing, the main goal _x000D_
is to lay out a reality, so we all understand really what we _x000D_
are facing here. And, when it comes to the different types of _x000D_
biothreats, these can be very serious._x000D_
    Maybe the good news about all of them is that the same _x000D_
types of procedures, processes, and kind of management _x000D_
structure can be put in place to respond to just about any of _x000D_
them, because the threats are always changing, as we are seeing _x000D_
just the different type of pathogens and the different _x000D_
biological threats that I just listed._x000D_
    So, again, I appreciate all of your work and effort in _x000D_
this. I appreciate you coming here._x000D_
    With that, I will turn it over to Senator Carper._x000D_

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER\1\"
2926264,2926263,2926265,19242,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand there _x000D_
is a vote at 10:30._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Carper appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 39._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926265,2926264,2926266,19242,1,    Yes.
2926266,2926265,2926267,19242,1,"    Do you want to just keep rolling, or do you _x000D_
want us to recess for the vote? Do you have to think about it?"
2926267,2926266,2926268,19242,1,"    It would probably be nice to keep rolling _x000D_
if we could, so why don't we try--you and I will tradeoff. _x000D_
Thank you."
2926268,2926267,2926269,19242,1,"    OK. Good. So, when the vote starts, I will _x000D_
leave--with the Chairman's concurrence--and go vote and come _x000D_
back right away. And, you guys can just keep talking. And then, _x000D_
we will start asking questions._x000D_
    Thank you all for coming. Mr. Chairman, thank you for _x000D_
bringing this together. This is an even more important hearing, _x000D_
given what is going on with the Zika virus. But, as the _x000D_
Chairman has said, last fall we convened a hearing to examine a _x000D_
report by this Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense chaired by _x000D_
a couple of our good friends--Joe Lieberman and Tom Ridge. And, _x000D_
one of the main points in their report was, there ought to be _x000D_
somebody in the Administration, one senior person, to lead it. _x000D_
They thought the Vice President would be a pretty good one, and _x000D_
so we will see. We had a meeting with the Vice President and _x000D_
the two co-chairs, and we will see where that leads._x000D_
    But there is a lot of work to be done, and, fortunately, _x000D_
the panel provided recommendations to further enhance our _x000D_
ability to prevent, to detect, to respond to, and to recover _x000D_
from a biological incident._x000D_
    Today, we have the opportunity to discuss those _x000D_
recommendations with the heads of several agencies--senior _x000D_
people in several agencies, who would be responsible for _x000D_
implementing some of the recommendations of the earlier panel. _x000D_
I am eager to hear your thoughts and also hear how you believe _x000D_
we can further improve our country's biodefense system. This is _x000D_
an important conversation to have in the context of recent _x000D_
global events, including a couple that are emerging even as we _x000D_
speak._x000D_
    Ebola continues to threaten West Africa, and--after _x000D_
claiming thousands of lives--the spread of the virus has _x000D_
declined significantly, thanks in no small part to the _x000D_
investments that America has made in the health systems of the _x000D_
countries that were hardest hit by the epidemic. I think it is _x000D_
one of the proudest chapters in our Nation's history as of _x000D_
late, and I am very proud of the work that was done, including _x000D_
by some of you and the folks that you lead. But, that said, the _x000D_
recent news of more cases in Guinea and Liberia underlines the _x000D_
need to continue supporting our international partners in their _x000D_
efforts to combat this disease._x000D_
    We are also almost one year removed from a significant _x000D_
outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu, which decimated some _x000D_
parts of our Nation's poultry industry. The Chairman's State _x000D_
was badly affected, as were a number of others in the Midwest. _x000D_
And, while infections of poultry have been limited in number so _x000D_
far this year, thank God, we must remain vigilant and continue _x000D_
to enforce good biosafety practices at poultry farms across the _x000D_
country to safeguard against another epidemic._x000D_
    Meanwhile, we are quickly approaching the beginning of _x000D_
mosquito season in most parts of the United States. _x000D_
Unfortunately, this presents us with a new threat--this one in _x000D_
the form of the Zika virus that we are hearing a whole lot _x000D_
about. The virus has spread explosively throughout Central and _x000D_
South America. It has already reached Puerto Rico and other _x000D_
U.S. territories and is expected to spread further as the _x000D_
weather warms. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates _x000D_
that as many as 4 million people in the Americas could contract _x000D_
Zika by the end of the year. Researchers continue to learn more _x000D_
about the virus every day--but it is clear that the health _x000D_
impacts can be devastating, particularly for pregnant women and _x000D_
their unborn children. We have all heard that the CDC has just _x000D_
recently confirmed this week something that a lot of folks have _x000D_
speculated for a while--that the Zika virus is a cause of _x000D_
severe birth defects._x000D_
    While most of the Zika cases diagnosed in American citizens _x000D_
to date have been traced to travel abroad, we must be prepared _x000D_
for the virus to present itself locally to us. So, it has been _x000D_
encouraging to see a proactive, coordinated response from the _x000D_
President and his Administration to this threat. For example, _x000D_
Federal agencies are helping State and local governments _x000D_
enhance their capacity to better detect and track the virus. _x000D_
There are also significant mosquito control efforts underway in _x000D_
areas that are most at risk._x000D_
    We also know that medical countermeasures and vaccine _x000D_
development are being rigorously pursued. We applaud that. To _x000D_
help fund these efforts, the Administration announced last week _x000D_
its intent to redirect almost $600 million from other _x000D_
programs--including funds originally designated for Ebola--and _x000D_
spend it on Zika response efforts. I believe the President made _x000D_
the right call in this instance. I am glad he has done this. _x000D_
While these efforts continue, Congress should continue to _x000D_
carefully consider the President's request for additional _x000D_
resources to combat this threat._x000D_
    In addition, we must ensure that our public health _x000D_
officials have the tools that they need to protect us from Zika _x000D_
and to prepare us for future threats. But, at the same time, we _x000D_
should not let our foot off of the gas when it comes to our _x000D_
efforts to contain dangerous diseases such as Ebola and avian _x000D_
influenza._x000D_
    With that, we welcome each of you. Thank you for your _x000D_
service, and thank you for your testimony today."
2926269,2926268,2926270,19242,1,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    It is the tradition of this Committee to swear in _x000D_
witnesses, so if you will all rise and raise your right hand. _x000D_
Do you swear the testimony you will give before this Committee _x000D_
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, _x000D_
so help you, God?"
2926270,2926269,2926271,19242,1,    I do.
2926271,2926270,2926272,19242,1,    I do.
2926272,2926271,2926273,19242,1,    I do.
2926273,2926272,2926274,19242,1,    I do.
2926274,2926273,2926275,19242,1,    I do.
2926275,2926274,2926276,19242,1,"    Somebody has a snappy tune there._x000D_
    Our first witness is Dr. Richard Hatchett. Dr. Hatchett is _x000D_
the Acting Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and _x000D_
Development Authority (BARDA) and the Acting Deputy Assistant _x000D_
Secretary in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for _x000D_
Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the Department of Health _x000D_
and Human Services (HHS). That is a big title. Among his many _x000D_
past roles, Dr. Hatchett has served at the National Institute _x000D_
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National _x000D_
Institutes of Health (NIH), on the White House National _x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF RICHARD J. HATCHETT, M.D.,\1\ ACTING DIRECTOR, _x000D_
BIOMEDICAL ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, OFFICE _x000D_
OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE, U."
2926276,2926275,2926277,19242,1,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and _x000D_
distinguished Members of the Senate Committee on Homeland _x000D_
Security and Governmental Affairs, good morning. Thank you for _x000D_
inviting me to testify on the state of our Nation's biodefense. _x000D_
I am Richard Hatchett, Acting Director of the Biomedical _x000D_
Advanced Research and Development Authority, and my testimony _x000D_
today will focus on steps taken by the Office of the Assistant _x000D_
Secretary for Preparedness and Response to strengthen our _x000D_
Nation's health security as well as the contributions of my own _x000D_
office toward that end._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Hatchett appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 41._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    We have made substantial progress in the past 10 years to _x000D_
advance the State of our national biodefense. Thanks to the _x000D_
support of this Committee and others in Congress, we have _x000D_
established BARDA and continue to make critical investments in _x000D_
biodefense and our health care system. However, as highlighted _x000D_
by recent challenges, such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory _x000D_
Syndrome (MERS), and Zika, there remain gaps in our _x000D_
preparedness._x000D_
    As this Committee is aware, a recent report by the Blue _x000D_
Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense has indicated that the United _x000D_
States is underprepared for biological threats and that the _x000D_
Nation is dangerously vulnerable to biological events--whether _x000D_
natural, intentional, or unintentional in origin._x000D_
    Where the civilian, public health, and medical response to _x000D_
such events is concerned, the ASPR is charged, by statute, to _x000D_
play a strong leadership role. The ASPR serves as the principal _x000D_
adviser to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on all _x000D_
matters related to Federal medical preparedness and response _x000D_
for public health emergencies. The ASPR chairs the HHS Disaster _x000D_
Leadership Group (DLG), which convenes in response to _x000D_
complicated emergencies, and the Public Health Emergency _x000D_
Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE), which coordinates _x000D_
medical countermeasures development efforts across the _x000D_
interagency. The ASPR is the author and custodian of the _x000D_
National Health Security Strategy (NHSS), which focuses on _x000D_
protecting public health during an emergency. The ASPR oversees _x000D_
2 critical programs that support medical response._x000D_
    The first, the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), _x000D_
enhances medical preparedness and resiliency at the community _x000D_
level through its support of health care coalitions._x000D_
    The second, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), _x000D_
deploys medical personnel and related assets when local _x000D_
resources are overwhelmed._x000D_
    The PHEMCE, for its part, promotes the development and _x000D_
acquisition of medical countermeasures for chemical, _x000D_
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats (CBRN), pandemic _x000D_
influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. PHEMCE _x000D_
coordination and decisionmaking encompass all stages of the _x000D_
medical countermeasure life cycle, from identifying _x000D_
requirements and developing target product profiles through _x000D_
product development to distribution and dispensing. The PHEMCE _x000D_
has an outstanding record of success and is now being studied _x000D_
as a model for global preparedness against emerging infectious _x000D_
diseases._x000D_
    To date, at least 23 medical countermeasures that BARDA has _x000D_
supported have been approved, licensed, or cleared by the Food _x000D_
and Drug Administration (FDA) under PHEMCE's purview. Of these, _x000D_
15 have been approved since 2011 and 5 have been approved in _x000D_
the last 12 months. 17 products--ranging from anthrax _x000D_
antitoxins and smallpox vaccines to anti-neutropenia cytokine _x000D_
therapeutics for acute radiation syndrome and an array of _x000D_
products for the management of thermal burns--have been added _x000D_
to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) under Project _x000D_
BioShield, with another 7 anticipated between now and the end _x000D_
of fiscal year (FY) 2018._x000D_
    Overall, since the year 2000, the FDA has approved 89 _x000D_
medical countermeasures for CBRN threats and pandemic _x000D_
influenza, as well as 17 supplemental changes to already _x000D_
approved applications and 71 modifications to diagnostic _x000D_
devices. This investment in preparedness has already paid _x000D_
dividends. Because of the workforce and capabilities we have _x000D_
developed over the last 10 years, we are much better prepared _x000D_
to respond quickly to emerging threats._x000D_
    The PHEMCE, for example, facilitated the rapid development _x000D_
and deployment of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics _x000D_
during the Ebola epidemic and is now fully engaged in the _x000D_
response to Zika._x000D_
    We know, from experience, that a well-coordinated PHEMCE _x000D_
response is a critical enabler of a rapid science and industry _x000D_
response. The PHEMCE succeeds not because a set of government _x000D_
offices succeeds, but because response efforts across the whole _x000D_
of society are supported and coordinated. To respond _x000D_
effectively to threats as diverse and unpredictable as the _x000D_
biological threats we face, nothing less than a whole-of-_x000D_
society response will work._x000D_
    Thank you again for the invitation to speak with you, and, _x000D_
at this time, I would be happy to address any questions you may _x000D_
have."
2926277,2926276,2926278,19242,1,"    Thank you, Dr. Hatchett._x000D_
    Our next witness is Dr. Stephen Redd. Dr. Redd is the _x000D_
Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and _x000D_
Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. _x000D_
Redd, who has been part of the Public Health Service for over _x000D_
30 years, is responsible for all of the CDC's public health _x000D_
preparedness and response activities. Is it pronounced Dr. _x000D_
Redd?"
2926278,2926277,2926279,19242,1,"    Yes, sir."

                     CONTROL AND PREVENTION"
2926280,2926279,2926281,19242,1,"    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and _x000D_
distinguished Members of the Committee, my name is Stephen _x000D_
Redd. As you have just heard, I am the Director of the Office _x000D_
of Public Health Preparedness and Response at the CDC, and it _x000D_
is my pleasure to appear today to discuss the work the CDC is _x000D_
doing to prepare and respond to threats to the health of the _x000D_
public._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Redd appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 59._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As you know, the CDC works to protect the public's health _x000D_
by helping communities improve readiness and response. This is _x000D_
for chemical, biological, and radiation emergencies--whether _x000D_
those are naturally occurring events like the Ebola epidemic or _x000D_
the Zika virus epidemic, intentional, or accidental._x000D_
    There are two key programs at the CDC that enable us to _x000D_
prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats: the _x000D_
Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Program and the _x000D_
Strategic National Stockpile. Both programs had their origins _x000D_
before September 11, 2001 (9/11) and the anthrax attacks of _x000D_
2001. They were greatly expanded after those events in _x000D_
recognition of the need to improve the ability of the public _x000D_
health system to respond in scale and in speed._x000D_
    The Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program's overall _x000D_
aim is to prepare the Nation to respond to public health _x000D_
emergencies. Since 2002, $10 billion has been devoted to this _x000D_
effort. The program funds 62 awardees: all 50 States, 4 large _x000D_
cities, and 8 territories. And what it actually funds are _x000D_
staff: epidemiologists, laboratory experts, and risk _x000D_
communication experts as well as emergency operations centers, _x000D_
laboratory equipment, planning and exercising efforts, and _x000D_
efforts to respond--or to correct things that are identified in _x000D_
exercises and natural events._x000D_
    The Strategic National Stockpile is the national repository _x000D_
of life-saving medicines, vaccines, and medical supplies, such _x000D_
as mechanical ventilators. Currently, the stockpile holds over _x000D_
$7 billion in assets. It operates as part of the Public Health _x000D_
Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise, which you have _x000D_
heard about. The stockpile procures, stores, and delivers _x000D_
supplies in times of emergency._x000D_
    Both the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program and _x000D_
the Strategic National Stockpile were instrumental in the Ebola _x000D_
response and are being used now as part of the Zika response. _x000D_
So let me now turn to Zika._x000D_
    As of yesterday, 41 countries have reported local _x000D_
transmission of the Zika virus. In the continental United _x000D_
States, over 300 travel-associated cases have been reported. _x000D_
About 1 in 10 of these are in pregnant women. 7 have been _x000D_
acquired through sexual transmission. There currently are no _x000D_
local transmissions by mosquitoes, but the problem exists here _x000D_
because of these travel-associated cases and sexually-_x000D_
transmitted cases. In Puerto Rico, there is transmission from _x000D_
mosquitoes--over 300 cases. About 1 in 6 of these are in _x000D_
pregnant women._x000D_
    Just to talk about some of the things that we are doing in _x000D_
the response to Zika, you heard from Senator Carper that _x000D_
yesterday the CDC authored a publication that concluded that _x000D_
the Zika virus infection causes severe birth defects. That _x000D_
article also identified a number of the outstanding scientific _x000D_
questions._x000D_
    On April 1, we convened the Zika Action Plan Summit in _x000D_
Atlanta. This brought together State and local health officials _x000D_
to review the latest scientific information and to jump-start _x000D_
planning at the State and local levels._x000D_
    We also issued travel guidance for women who are pregnant _x000D_
within 72 hours of identifying the virus in the brains of _x000D_
children and fetuses that had died. We have developed _x000D_
laboratory tests. We are working closely with local health _x000D_
departments and we are implementing mosquito control measures _x000D_
with the government of Puerto Rico to prevent transmission to _x000D_
pregnant women._x000D_
    Public health threats are ever present. Due to the _x000D_
investments from Congress, the Nation is better prepared to _x000D_
prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies than we were _x000D_
before the events of September 2001. And, at the CDC, we are on _x000D_
the frontlines to protect Americans from health threats _x000D_
wherever those threats occur. From recent experience, we know _x000D_
that we will be called upon to respond in the future._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926281,2926280,2926282,19242,1,"    Thank you, Dr. Redd._x000D_
    Our next witness is Mr. Kevin Shea. Mr. Shea is the _x000D_
Administrator of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) _x000D_
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Mr. Shea _x000D_
carries out the agency's broad mission of protecting and _x000D_
promoting American agriculture, regulating genetically _x000D_
engineered organisms, administering the Animal Welfare Act, and _x000D_
carrying out wildlife damage management activities. Mr. Shea._x000D_

  TESTIMONY OF KEVIN SHEA,\1\ ADMINISTRATOR, ANIMAL AND PLANT _x000D_
   HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, U."
2926282,2926281,2926283,19242,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Carper, Senator _x000D_
Ayotte, and Senator Booker. I appreciate you all being here _x000D_
today to hear us._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Shea appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 70._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    At APHIS, over 8,000 men and women work around the world to _x000D_
protect American agriculture and natural resources against _x000D_
plant and animal pests and diseases. We want to keep them out _x000D_
of the country, but if they do get into the country, we have _x000D_
the expertise and the tools to detect them, to control them, _x000D_
and, hopefully, to eradicate them._x000D_
    Although the crux of our mission is plant and animal _x000D_
health, we understand that, of course, there is a crucial link _x000D_
between plant and animal health and human health. Our _x000D_
partnerships with the CDC and other Federal and State agencies _x000D_
emphasize this ``One Health'' (OH) approach._x000D_
    Animal health can affect human health and human health can _x000D_
affect animal health. That is why it is so important that we _x000D_
communicate and coordinate with each other. That is why the _x000D_
emphasis on ``One Health'' in the ``National Blueprint for _x000D_
Biodefense'' is so important and why we strongly support it and _x000D_
appreciate that they emphasized it._x000D_
    I want to highlight just a few examples of what APHIS does _x000D_
with our partners._x000D_
    First, we created, within our Veterinary Services Program, _x000D_
a One Health Coordination Center (OHCC). This center works _x000D_
closely with our internal veterinarians to make sure that they _x000D_
are considering the human health aspects of animal health _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    At the same time, they work with their counterparts in the _x000D_
human health arena to make sure those agencies have an _x000D_
understanding of how what they do can affect agriculture and _x000D_
animal health. Because this communication is so important, we _x000D_
have embedded an APHIS veterinarian in Atlanta with the CDC to _x000D_
exchange information literally every day._x000D_
    We always share information with our partners about our _x000D_
well-established zoonotic disease surveillance efforts, and _x000D_
when we have information about potentially damaging diseases, _x000D_
we share that quickly. Of course, this Committee knows--as the _x000D_
Chairman and Senator Carper alluded to earlier--you all know _x000D_
the devastating impact avian influenza had last year on our _x000D_
producers, but also the impact it had on the availability and _x000D_
price of eggs and turkey. 1,000 APHIS employees and thousands _x000D_
of contractors and State employees did the important frontline _x000D_
work to control that disease, but, behind the scenes, our _x000D_
partnerships with the groups with us today were there and were _x000D_
very important. Our scientists shared information with the CDC _x000D_
about avian influenza--about the virus. We had no reason to _x000D_
think that that virus was going to be a human health threat, _x000D_
but avian influenza viruses mutate. And so, we were constantly _x000D_
supplying information to the CDC so they could develop _x000D_
candidate vaccines if indeed it ever should have jumped over to _x000D_
be a human health problem._x000D_
    We also are working very closely with our colleagues in the _x000D_
Fish and Wildlife Service to test wild birds. And, the good _x000D_
news is, we tested 43,000 wild birds over the last 9 months and _x000D_
have found no more examples of high-path avian influenza in _x000D_
those birds. So, that is some hopeful information._x000D_
    We spent a lot of time assessing our efforts in controlling _x000D_
avian influenza last year as well as on our capability to _x000D_
detect it. And, we compiled a very substantial, very large new _x000D_
planning document on what we can do to prevent avian influenza _x000D_
from becoming a huge problem again. And, we had a chance to _x000D_
test that out already. In Indiana, in January, there was indeed _x000D_
one case of highly pathogenic influenza and 9 cases of low-_x000D_
pathogenic avian influenza associated with that. We were able _x000D_
to get on top of that, immediately, to wipe that out, and we _x000D_
have had no cases of avian influenza other than that since last _x000D_
June 17._x000D_
    Something we learned, in all of our review, was that we _x000D_
need to rebuild our capacity to respond to large animal health _x000D_
emergencies. We have 200 fewer animal health professionals--_x000D_
veterinarians and animal health technicians--than we had 10 _x000D_
years ago. We need to rebuild that workforce. And Secretary Tom _x000D_
Vilsack certainly recognized that, and, in the President's _x000D_
budget request for FY 2017, there is a proposed $30 million _x000D_
increase for animal health emergency response because we _x000D_
realized just how lucky we were to get on top of avian _x000D_
influenza after all of the damage that it did do._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony, and I appreciate _x000D_
the opportunity to be here. I would certainly be happy to _x000D_
answer any questions."

    Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished _x000D_
Members of this Committee, I want to thank you for inviting me _x000D_
to speak with you today. I appreciate the opportunity to _x000D_
testify on the Department of Homeland Security's role in _x000D_
biodefense, and it is an honor to sit beside my colleagues from _x000D_
HHS, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Government _x000D_
Accountability Office (GAO). As you mentioned, I am the _x000D_
Director of the National Biosurveillance Integration Center. I _x000D_
am a microbiologist by training. I have done some work with _x000D_
anthrax at the NIH. And, I understood biodefense policy through _x000D_
service to this Committee, so I want to thank you. These _x000D_
experiences have given me a broad understanding of the _x000D_
biological threat to our homeland and a strong commitment to _x000D_
help improve our Nation's biodefense and progress._x000D_
    The threats and risks posed by emerging infectious diseases _x000D_
and the use of biological agents by terrorist organizations, _x000D_
violent extremists, and rogue States will continue to challenge _x000D_
our ability to warn, prepare, and protect the homeland._x000D_
    In the wake of these threats, the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security remains fully engaged and proactive in characterizing _x000D_
the threat, providing warning of emerging and imminent _x000D_
diseases, and ensuring that the critical missions of the _x000D_
Department will continue, unabated, should a biological event _x000D_
occur._x000D_
    For example, during our recent Ebola virus disease outbreak _x000D_
in West Africa, DHS provided intelligence analysis to the _x000D_
interagency, State and local governments, and first responders. _x000D_
We directed research to better characterize the threat of Ebola _x000D_
persistence and fill gaps in public health and operational _x000D_
responses. And, we coordinated and implemented the enhanced _x000D_
screening for more than 42,000 international passengers at 5 _x000D_
airports._x000D_
    Today, we continue to build upon these lessons learned from _x000D_
the responses to Ebola and apply them to other biological _x000D_
threats, as we tackle the emergence or reemergence of viruses _x000D_
like Zika, where we are ensuring that our partners continue to _x000D_
have timely information, our workforce is informed of _x000D_
protective measures, and the health interests of detainees in _x000D_
our care and custody is provided for. We must remain vigilant _x000D_
and innovative as biological threats continue to evolve and as _x000D_
new threats emerge._x000D_
    The DHS Office of Health Affairs coordinates the _x000D_
Department's biodefense activities to understand and meet these _x000D_
threats, today, and to be ready for the threats that will _x000D_
emerge, tomorrow. OHA synthesizes biological threat information _x000D_
from multiple sources and takes a true ``One Health'' approach _x000D_
to biodefense and emergency response._x000D_
    For large-scale biological events, having knowledge as _x000D_
quickly as possible allows for informed decisions that can save _x000D_
American lives. And to this end, the Department's operational _x000D_
biodetection and biosurveillance programs are critical to our _x000D_
Nation's biodefense._x000D_
    The National Biosurveillance Integration Center is uniquely _x000D_
situated within DHS to provide a fusion of human health, animal _x000D_
health, and environmental data to ensure our Nation's _x000D_
decisionmakers have timely, accurate, and actionable _x000D_
information._x000D_
    To accomplish this, we monitor thousands of data sources _x000D_
and leverage the expertise of 14 Federal departments and _x000D_
agencies, who are members of our charter--including those that _x000D_
you see at this table here--and then integrate this array of _x000D_
information into reports on biological incidents that could _x000D_
potentially cause economic damage, social disruption, or loss _x000D_
of life._x000D_
    Reports by my good colleagues at GAO and the Blue Ribbon _x000D_
Study Panel on Biodefense have acknowledged the progress that _x000D_
NBIC has made in delivering daily situational awareness to our _x000D_
partners, but we still have a lot of work to do to fully _x000D_
realize the vision that this Committee helped to start with _x000D_
comprehensive biosurveillance integration._x000D_
    To address this, we are developing new collaboration tools, _x000D_
pursuing innovative data sources and methods, and fostering _x000D_
greater stakeholder engagement._x000D_
    DHS's BioWatch Program provides Federal, State, and local _x000D_
leaders with actionable information on detection of a _x000D_
biological agent to enable a coordinated and effective _x000D_
response. One important and frequently overlooked benefit of _x000D_
our BioWatch Program is how we work with each local _x000D_
jurisdiction to ensure that the decisionmakers are familiar _x000D_
with how the coordinated response will unfold should the _x000D_
detection of one of these agents occur. There is no other _x000D_
program that provides this layer of biological defense._x000D_
    The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is _x000D_
currently collaborating with OHA on enhancements to the _x000D_
BioWatch Program that will shorten the time needed to detect _x000D_
biological agents as well as address other short-term and long-_x000D_
term capability needs._x000D_
    One of our most critical roles is in the integration of _x000D_
local public health with emergency management, law enforcement, _x000D_
and intelligence community (IC) partners--and their preparation _x000D_
and response to biological events. One initiative we are _x000D_
developing in coordination with HHS is the ``First Responder _x000D_
Vaccine Initiative.'' We are evaluating the feasibility of a _x000D_
voluntary pre-event anthrax vaccination program for first _x000D_
responders using the anthrax vaccine scheduled to rotate out of _x000D_
CDC's Strategic National Stockpile. I want to thank this _x000D_
Committee for moving on S. 1915, Senator Ayotte's legislation _x000D_
authorizing this pilot program._x000D_
    I thank you for your time, and I look forward to answering _x000D_
your questions."
2926285,2926284,2926286,19242,1,"    Thank you, Doctor._x000D_
    Our final witness is Chris Currie. Mr. Currie is the _x000D_
Director of Homeland Security and Justice at the Government _x000D_
Accountability Office, where he leads the agency's work in _x000D_
evaluating emergency management, national preparedness, and _x000D_
critical infrastructure protection issues. In this role, Mr. _x000D_

2926286,2926285,2926287,19242,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member _x000D_
Carper, and other Members of the Committee who are here today. _x000D_
I really appreciate the opportunity to be here, and, today, I _x000D_
would like to talk about GAO's work on biodefense._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Currie appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 82._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Defending the United States from naturally occurring or _x000D_
manmade biological events is a massive and difficult effort. _x000D_
Leadership and coordination are critical to such a large and _x000D_
fragmented effort, not only at the Federal level, but across _x000D_
levels of government and the private sector. The number of _x000D_
Federal departments at this table today, alone, demonstrates _x000D_
this point._x000D_
    In a hearing last fall, your Committee heard the findings _x000D_
and recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on _x000D_
Biodefense. Our work through the years has come to many similar _x000D_
conclusions and recommendations. Today, I would like to talk _x000D_
about this work--ranging from coordinating the entire _x000D_
biodefense enterprise down to improving various specific _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    At the highest level, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on _x000D_
Biodefense concluded that there is no central leader, no _x000D_
comprehensive national strategic plan, and no all-inclusive _x000D_
dedicated budget for biodefense. Our work has also found that _x000D_
there is no national strategy or single focal point for _x000D_
biodefense._x000D_
    As an illustration, there are over two dozen Presidentially _x000D_
appointed officials with biodefense roles. Over 5 years ago, we _x000D_
recommended that the Homeland Security Council within the White _x000D_
House develop a strategy and designate a focal point for _x000D_
coordination._x000D_
    They did issue a strategy in 2012 for biosurveillance and _x000D_
designated offices within the White House as focal points--and _x000D_
this is progress and it shows a commitment to coordinating _x000D_
biodefense efforts. However, it just does not go far enough._x000D_
    The biosurveillance strategy does not identify resource and _x000D_
investment needs, which is critical to help prioritize _x000D_
resources across such a complex enterprise. We have heard that _x000D_
the National Security staff created a more specific _x000D_
implementation plan of the strategy. However, we do not know _x000D_
the extent to which it is actually being used across government _x000D_
and across these departments. Thus, we do not know if it will _x000D_
operationalize coordination and prioritization of resources, as _x000D_
we think it should._x000D_
    We have also identified challenges with specific agency _x000D_
biodefense programs, such as those within DHS. Our report last _x000D_
October found that 12 years after the BioWatch program was _x000D_
first deployed, there is still not reliable information about _x000D_
its capabilities. This is because it was put in the field so _x000D_
quickly without performance requirements._x000D_
    We have also found that, because BioWatch was not fully _x000D_
tested, its uncertainties and limitations are unknown. We _x000D_
recommended that DHS not pursue upgrades until it establishes _x000D_
system performance requirements and tests against those._x000D_
    I would also like to talk about our work on the National _x000D_
Biosurveillance Integration Center--also within DHS. NBIC was _x000D_
set up, in law, to be the integrator, analyzer, and innovator _x000D_
of biosurveillance information across the entire Federal _x000D_
Government. However, it has never fully met this bar. NBIC has _x000D_
implemented our recommendations to strengthen collaboration _x000D_
within its partners, like CDC, HHS, and USDA. However, we _x000D_
reported last year that persistent challenges still get in the _x000D_
way._x000D_
    For example, most of its primary Federal partners--those _x000D_
like CDC and HHS--told us that NBIC's products and activities _x000D_
did not add value, did not provide new meaning, or did not help _x000D_
them identify biological events quicker. NBIC also still has _x000D_
difficulty getting the data it needs because partners either _x000D_
will not share it or there are restrictions to sharing that _x000D_
data._x000D_
    The challenges that NBIC faces are not easy to address by _x000D_
DHS, alone. We have identified options for policy or structural _x000D_
changes to help NBIC better fulfill its mission. However, these _x000D_
options may require changes in law--and it is not clear that _x000D_
even these would address the challenge._x000D_
    This brings me back to the bigger issue. As we and the Blue _x000D_
Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense have noted, investments in _x000D_
specific programs should be evaluated in terms of cost and _x000D_
benefit, but they should also be prioritized against other _x000D_
programs across government as part of a national biodefense _x000D_
strategy._x000D_
    Another critical part of this prioritization should be _x000D_
using the most recent threat and risk information to guide _x000D_
decisions. This is implemented to ensure that our limited _x000D_
resources are directed to the most important areas. Without a _x000D_
strategy that bridges across departments, it is difficult for _x000D_
decision-makers in Congress and those in the executive branch _x000D_
to make resource decisions above the traditional agency-by-_x000D_
agency approach._x000D_
    This concludes my prepared remarks. I would be happy to _x000D_
answer your questions."
2926287,2926286,2926288,19242,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Currie._x000D_
    I want to kind of go back to this within the specific _x000D_
agencies to get just sort of an update on exactly where we are. _x000D_
I want to start with the USDA. Mr. Shea, the last avian _x000D_
outbreak occurred between December and June, and that was _x000D_
basically migratory birds flying south, correct?"
2926288,2926287,2926289,19242,1,    Correct.
2926289,2926288,2926290,19242,1,"    But, obviously, in June, they are also _x000D_
flying back. I just kind of want to get to--to what extent have _x000D_
we dodged this bullet? Have we gone through now, basically, 2 _x000D_
additional migratory patterns without this hitting us again?"
2926290,2926289,2926291,19242,1,"    Mr. Chairman, it is still too soon to say. What _x000D_
ended up being the final end to the outbreak last year really _x000D_
was due to the onset of warm weather. Once the temperatures get _x000D_
consistently above 70 degrees, the virus pretty much will not _x000D_
survive."
2926291,2926290,2926292,19242,1,"    Very similar to human flu, then."
2926292,2926291,2926293,19242,1,    Yes.
2926293,2926292,2926294,19242,1,"    OK. So we were kind of getting it coming _x000D_
and going then--migratory birds coming up, coming back--but _x000D_
then temperatures got to a certain point, and that outbreak _x000D_
ended."
2926294,2926293,2926295,19242,1,"    Exactly. And also, what happens with the _x000D_
migratory birds, when they are flying south, they pretty much _x000D_
have a clear path. They just keep going. When they are heading _x000D_
north, they can slow down. For example, what happened last _x000D_
year--and the reason we thought it was so bad in Iowa and _x000D_
Wisconsin--was that the birds were heading north, but the _x000D_
weather was still too cold. They got to a spot where the lakes _x000D_
were still frozen and hung out."
2926295,2926294,2926296,19242,1,"    I live on one of those lakes, so, yes, _x000D_
OK, I got it. So, that is pretty good news, though._x000D_
    Now, the outbreak in Indiana--is that typical, where we _x000D_
just on occasion see these small, little outbreaks and stuff _x000D_
and we can respond quickly? Or is that----"
2926296,2926295,2926297,19242,1,"    It is typical to find low-pathogenic avian _x000D_
influenza outbreaks. They happen from time to time. What we _x000D_
believe happened here was probably a low-pathogenic virus that _x000D_
may have mutated on just the one farm. The local surrounding _x000D_
area where we had 9 or 10 other infected premises were all low-_x000D_
pathogenic."
2926297,2926296,2926298,19242,1,"    OK. But, again, that was probably _x000D_
spreading out by migratory birds. That was just spread within _x000D_
that localized flock, hopefully."
2926298,2926297,2926299,19242,1,"    It may have started with a migratory bird, but _x000D_
have spread as you suggest."
2926299,2926298,2926300,19242,1,"    OK. I want to kind of revisit Ebola. I _x000D_
will go to Dr. Firoved. Has that been totally wiped out? Has _x000D_
that been completely contained? Are there any active cases _x000D_
right now in Africa that we are aware of?"
2926300,2926299,2926301,19242,1,"    Unfortunately, we have seen cases reemerge in _x000D_
Guinea and Liberia. So, I will defer to my colleague from the _x000D_
CDC, but, there is some active tracing going on."
2926301,2926300,2926302,19242,1,"    Dr. Redd, tell me what happened there. _x000D_
Did we get to a level of zero and it is just coming back, or _x000D_
what?"
2926302,2926301,2926303,19242,1,"    So, the widespread transmission that was seen in _x000D_
2014 and 2015 has been contained. What we have seen, _x000D_
repeatedly, in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and now, in Guinea, are _x000D_
very small clusters, identified after a few cases--with very _x000D_
rapid response, and by implementing the measures that brought _x000D_
the disease under control when it was more widespread. _x000D_
Unfortunately, this is not unexpected. The latest case we _x000D_
believe is from sexual transmission. A person that had Ebola in _x000D_
the past transmitted that disease through the route of sexual _x000D_
transmission, and then a small cluster occurred. And, I think _x000D_
that this outbreak is now being worked on very hard, both in _x000D_
Guinea and in Liberia--and those cases in Liberia are connected _x000D_
to the ones in Guinea._x000D_
    The thing that is different now is that the response is _x000D_
very vigorous. Large numbers of contacts are being identified _x000D_
and traced to be sure that, if one of those people does become _x000D_
sick, they will be put into isolation and given treatment very _x000D_
quickly."
2926303,2926302,2926304,19242,1,"    Because of the tragedy that occurred _x000D_
there, is the general population far more educated on this as _x000D_
well as--in addition to the public health and safety officials _x000D_
who know how to respond? Is it a combination of that, or is it _x000D_
primarily--tell me what worked. What lessons have we learned?"
2926304,2926303,2926305,19242,1,"    Well, I think, to go back to the lessons, the _x000D_
situation that is occurring right now is not that different _x000D_
than what occurred in March through April 2014, in terms of _x000D_
where the disease is occurring and the location. The thing that _x000D_
is different is that we have a much more vigorous response--so, _x000D_
both in Guinea and in Liberia, there is the capacity to _x000D_
identify those cases quickly and respond, and there is an _x000D_
international presence that is able to respond._x000D_
    And, to go back to 2014, the things that did not happen _x000D_
that needed to happen concerned the ability of those _x000D_
governments to rapidly identify cases, to respond effectively _x000D_
to them, to call for help when the response was not going well, _x000D_
as well as for the international community to be able to _x000D_
respond. That is basically the structure of the Global Health _x000D_
Security Agenda (GHSA) which is being implemented in those _x000D_
countries and in other countries in Africa, Asia, and the _x000D_
Americas."
2926305,2926304,2926306,19242,1,"    So, again, you are basically describing _x000D_
real progress, in terms of public health and the work of safety _x000D_
officials. Has there been any progress just in terms of _x000D_
information to the general population where these things--let _x000D_
us face it, Ebola breaks out in these African countries."
2926306,2926305,2926307,19242,1,"    I think that there has been, and I think that, _x000D_
particularly, at that inflection point, depending on the _x000D_
country, in 2014 and 2015, it is likely that a lot of the _x000D_
control was actually implemented outside of official channels, _x000D_
that communities understood the risk that Ebola caused and took _x000D_
measures into their own hands, in terms of isolation _x000D_
facilities, local care, etc._x000D_
    I think this is actually a really important question that _x000D_
we need to have better hard data on, but it appears that that _x000D_
was an important part of the response--in addition to the _x000D_
community mobilization and communication efforts that took _x000D_
place."
2926307,2926306,2926308,19242,1,"    I hate that I am going to ask this, but--_x000D_
what was the final mortality rate? How many people were really _x000D_
affected? Because, when this first broke out, we were _x000D_
projecting literally a few months from then there being a _x000D_
million people."
2926308,2926307,2926309,19242,1,"    Yes, sir."
2926309,2926308,2926310,19242,1,"    So, how did we finally contain this?"
2926310,2926309,2926311,19242,1,"    It did not reach a million people, and that _x000D_
estimate of a million people was in the absence of any control _x000D_
measures. So, I think in some ways, even though the number was _x000D_
massive, it was not what----"
2926311,2926310,2926312,19242,1,"    It did not hurt to get the public's _x000D_
attention so we could respond. We ended up with tens of _x000D_
thousands?"
2926312,2926311,2926313,19242,1,"    Tens of thousands of cases and 10,000 or so _x000D_
deaths. And, just for context, the total number of cases, in _x000D_
all of the outbreaks up to that point, was around 2,500. So, _x000D_
around 10 times more cases than had ever occurred, and one of _x000D_
the things--just thinking about the sexual transmission side of _x000D_
it--we probably have twice as many male survivors as there were _x000D_
total cases before this outbreak."
2926313,2926312,2926314,19242,1,"    Is that pretty unusual? I mean, was that _x000D_
because of additional treatment? Hydration? So, how many people _x000D_
were infected? How many people died? What was the survival _x000D_
rate?"
2926314,2926313,2926315,19242,1,"    Yes, I mean, I can give you the exact number from _x000D_
reports."
2926315,2926314,2926316,19242,1,    I just looked at----
2926316,2926315,2926317,19242,1,"    But, 25,000. And, 12,000 deaths--something like _x000D_
that."
2926317,2926316,2926318,19242,1,    From how many people infected?
2926318,2926317,2926319,19242,1,"    25,000. So, about a 50-percent mortality rate, _x000D_
overall. And, when I give those numbers, I have to say that the _x000D_
quality of that information, particularly early in the outbreak _x000D_
when medical services were overrun--many deaths occurring in _x000D_
the community----"
2926319,2926318,2926320,19242,1,"    I understand. I am just trying to get _x000D_
some sense----"
2926320,2926319,2926321,19242,1,    Just in order of magnitude.
2926321,2926320,2926322,19242,1,"    Where are we at, in terms of the _x000D_
development of a vaccine? Because Ebola has been around. We _x000D_
were working on a vaccine. It just was not really a top _x000D_
priority. I would imagine it has become a priority. Are we _x000D_
making progress, in terms of a vaccine?"
2926322,2926321,2926323,19242,1,"    Yes, sir. I will answer that question, _x000D_
specifically, and then I will turn to my colleague from BARDA. _x000D_
A vaccine is actually being used now to control the outbreak in _x000D_
Guinea and Liberia. There were 3 clinical trials of different _x000D_
vaccines that were undertaken. The ones in Liberia and Sierra _x000D_
Leone, the vaccine got there after the disease was on the down _x000D_
trend, so they were not able to show effectiveness. They were _x000D_
able to measure the safety of the vaccine. A trial conducted in _x000D_
Guinea using a different strategy to use the vaccine and to _x000D_
measure its effectiveness did find the vaccine to be _x000D_
effective--and this was a containment strategy where a case was _x000D_
identified and then the cluster of contacts and the contacts of _x000D_
the contacts were vaccinated to prevent onward transmission. _x000D_
And, that study did show effectiveness."
2926323,2926322,2926324,19242,1,"    So, what level of effectiveness? I _x000D_
realize it is just a ballpark, but, I mean----"
2926324,2926323,2926325,19242,1,"    Yes, I would have to get back to you----"
2926325,2926324,2926326,19242,1,"    Was it pretty darn effective?_x000D_
there are some questions about whether a person was exposed or _x000D_
not. It was not shown to be effective--or it was not tested to _x000D_
be effective before the period of 6 days after exposure. So, _x000D_
after that period of time, it did demonstrate effectiveness. I _x000D_
can come back to you with the exact number on that."
2926326,2926325,2926327,19242,1,"    OK._x000D_
    I actually have the luxury, because I am here by myself, to _x000D_
keep asking questions._x000D_
    Did we ever get to the bottom of the infection of those _x000D_
nurses in Texas? We were, again, assuming that we kind of had _x000D_
this understood and we were going to take precautions--and yet, _x000D_
we still had----"
2926327,2926326,2926328,19242,1,"    Yes, sir. Well----"
2926328,2926327,2926329,19242,1,"    So, did we ever solve that mystery, in _x000D_
terms of how those nurses got----"
2926329,2926328,2926330,19242,1,"    I am not sure we totally solved it. What we did _x000D_
do was put in place a different plan for personal protective _x000D_
equipment, which included very specific guidance on what types _x000D_
of protective equipment were needed and also put in place a _x000D_
strategy to train people to use that personal protective _x000D_
equipment before needing it. Then, there was the additional _x000D_
specificity of, when a person is being treated for Ebola, _x000D_
including things like observers to make sure that a person does _x000D_
not accidentally, when they are taking the equipment off--kind _x000D_
of a risk period--that something did not happen. And then, also _x000D_
following those individuals after the person was gone. Similar _x000D_
to the returning travelers that Dr. Firoved mentioned--tracking _x000D_
them daily until the potential incubation period was over."
2926330,2926329,2926331,19242,1,"    So, from the start of that outbreak to _x000D_
kind of the final conclusion of it, it seems like, certainly, _x000D_
the procedure was, ``We can handle this in hospitals to the _x000D_
point where now let us do it in very specialized hospitals.'' _x000D_
Is that kind of the process and procedure in place now, that we _x000D_
are going to have basically ``Centers of Excellence'' here, _x000D_
and, hospitals are going to have to be ready, because they _x000D_
would have to respond properly--but then transport individuals _x000D_
that proved positive?"
2926331,2926330,2926332,19242,1,"    So, for Ebola that is the system that is in _x000D_
place. I think a lot of the discussion is about other diseases _x000D_
that there might be more cases of and trying to adapt that _x000D_
system, so that we have the right care for people who have _x000D_
these very severe effects. I think I would pass it to Dr. _x000D_
Hatchett."
2926332,2926331,2926333,19242,1,"    And, by the way, Ebola is obviously a _x000D_
unique disease, but the procedures in place, those are good _x000D_
procedures for a number of types of situations?"
2926333,2926332,2926334,19242,1,"    Yes, sir. I think there are a couple of _x000D_
characteristics about Ebola that are different, and that _x000D_
probably is, primarily, the small number of cases and the need _x000D_
for the very rigorous infection control procedures. If there _x000D_
were a large number of cases, the system that we have in place _x000D_
would have to be changed."
2926334,2926333,2926335,19242,1,    Right. It would be overwhelmed.
2926335,2926334,2926336,19242,1,"    We are sort of in the kind of dozens of cases _x000D_
level of capability."
2926336,2926335,2926337,19242,1,"    Dr. Hatchett, can you kind of speak to _x000D_
the progress of the vaccine--and, obviously, the _x000D_
effectiveness--but also to our ability to produce it?"
2926337,2926336,2926338,19242,1,"    Of course. Would you like me to touch on the _x000D_
Ebola treatment centers?"
2926338,2926337,2926339,19242,1,    Sure.
2926339,2926338,2926340,19242,1,"    So, just to answer that question and then to _x000D_
go back to the vaccine question, through ASPR's Hospital _x000D_
Preparedness Program, with the assistance of the funding that _x000D_
was provided by Congress in the Ebola supplemental, we have _x000D_
established a tiered system, nationally, of Ebola treatment _x000D_
centers. There are now 9 regional Ebola treatment centers. _x000D_
There are 3 education and training centers at the pinnacle of _x000D_
that system, and then there is a system of feeding hospitals--I _x000D_
believe the number is 73--State or local Ebola treatment _x000D_
centers that can manage patients, temporarily, before they can _x000D_
be transferred to the 9 centers that are fully equipped. And _x000D_
then, there is a larger system of assessment hospitals. I _x000D_
believe the number is over 200, nationally."
2926340,2926339,2926341,19242,1,"    OK. Thank you._x000D_
    I have to go vote. I am going to turn it over to Senator _x000D_
Carper. Hopefully, I can get back here, and we can kind of _x000D_
follow up."
2926341,2926340,2926342,19242,1,"    I will talk about the vaccine._x000D_
had to leave as soon as you started to speak--and it was not _x000D_
cause and effect, but we trade off like this. We usually have _x000D_
15 minutes in which we can vote, so this way we can keep things _x000D_
rolling and not unduly delay you. But, just take a minute and _x000D_
give me _x000D_
the--over in the House of Representatives, people give 1-minute _x000D_
speeches, and so, I will ask you to give us your best 1-minute _x000D_
speech, please."
2926342,2926341,2926343,19242,1,"    I will do my best, sir. So, I think from my _x000D_
oral statement, there were 2 big areas I wanted to focus on. _x000D_
First, was what I called the 60,000-foot level, the _x000D_
coordination across the biodefense enterprise. And then, the _x000D_
second piece was looking at some of the specific programs at _x000D_
DHS that we have looked at. Of course, we have done a lot of _x000D_
work at HHS and USDA as well._x000D_
    But, let me focus on the 60,000-foot level. I think a _x000D_
problem that we have identified through the years--and so has _x000D_
the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense--is the lack of a _x000D_
unified strategy at the top--at the Federal level--to guide all _x000D_
of the departmental efforts and resources. And, all of the _x000D_
departments work really hard and do a very good job of doing _x000D_
their individual missions. The problem is, there is nobody _x000D_
above that has the authority or the ability to actually drive _x000D_
resource decisions and priorities. And so, that makes it very _x000D_
difficult to know if we are addressing the top priorities. And _x000D_
so, that was a key point from my opening statement."
2926343,2926342,2926344,19242,1,"    All right. As you know, we talked a little _x000D_
bit--I mentioned the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense co-_x000D_
led by Joe Lieberman and Tom Ridge. And, one of their _x000D_
recommendations spoke--or at least attempted to speak to the _x000D_
point you have just made. Let me just ask all of you, with _x000D_
respect to the recommendations--I think they made 33 _x000D_
recommendations, and a major recommendation was that the Vice _x000D_
President should be sort of the person to lead this. What _x000D_
current and planned activities are each of you taking, or _x000D_
planning to take, to address the recommendations contained in _x000D_
the report? What do you think about the recommendations for the _x000D_
Vice President, in this case, Joe Biden, leading this effort _x000D_
for the next 9 months and then, presumably, whoever succeeds _x000D_
him leading afterwards?"
2926344,2926343,2926345,19242,1,    I can start.
2926345,2926344,2926346,19242,1,"    Yes, please."
2926346,2926345,2926347,19242,1,"    We have not taken a formal position on whether _x000D_
the Vice President's Office is the right place to place that _x000D_
responsibility or not. But, we understand why the Blue Ribbon _x000D_
Study Panel on Biodefense made the recommendation that the Vice _x000D_
President serve that role, because it needs to be somebody in a _x000D_
position of authority that can guide all of the Federal _x000D_
departments, each with their own powers and responsibilities, _x000D_
to do things and spend money a certain way._x000D_
    We made our initial recommendations along those lines to _x000D_
the National Security staff within the White House, and so I _x000D_
think--and our goal there was, again, to try to put it at a _x000D_
level that was above the departmental level._x000D_
    So far, I think we have been a little underwhelmed at the _x000D_
efforts that have come out of the response to that _x000D_
recommendation. There have been some strategies developed. The _x000D_
problem is that, even within those offices, they still have _x000D_
trouble dictating exactly what the other Federal departments _x000D_
are doing._x000D_
    So, I am not sure what the right entity is, but I think the _x000D_
problem is consistent across our work and the Panel's work."
2926347,2926346,2926348,19242,1,"    All right. Thank you. Thank you very much._x000D_
    Others, please? Dr. Hatchett, what current or planned _x000D_
activities are you all taking, or planning to take, to address _x000D_
the recommendations contained in the report?"
2926348,2926347,2926349,19242,1,"    Thank you, Senator, for the question. We _x000D_
certainly participated in the process that led to the _x000D_
development of the report. We participated in the meetings. We _x000D_
read the report, with interest, when it came out. We feel that _x000D_
we have actually undertaken activities that address or parallel _x000D_
some of the recommendations in the report. I just mentioned the _x000D_
establishment of the Ebola treatment centers and the national _x000D_
hospital system for managing diseases that require high _x000D_
containment--that, in some ways, is similar to a recommendation _x000D_
within the report._x000D_
    We are not responding directly to the report, but we _x000D_
certainly feel that it has been a valuable contribution to the _x000D_
national discussion on this issue."
2926349,2926348,2926350,19242,1,"    What do you think of the point of Mr. _x000D_
Currie--the point that the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on _x000D_
Biodefense recommended the Vice President be anointed to follow _x000D_
up and implement the recommendations of the report? If not the _x000D_
Vice President, how about the junior Senator from, maybe, New _x000D_
Jersey? [Laughter.]_x000D_
    He does not have much going on now. He has finished his _x000D_
book and he has finished his book tour. He is looking for stuff _x000D_
to work on. No, I am just kidding."
2926350,2926349,2926351,19242,1,"    So, we feel that we have effective cross-_x000D_
government mechanisms in place, already, to ensure that threats _x000D_
can be identified and responded to appropriately within the _x000D_
statutory sphere of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness _x000D_
and Response, which is public health and medical preparedness _x000D_
and response. We actually have mechanisms in place which reduce _x000D_
the need for a central oversight figure. We have two very _x000D_
effective coordinating bodies that are interagency bodies where _x000D_
we work with our colleagues at the CDC, the FDA, the Department _x000D_
of Defense (DOD), etc._x000D_
    The first of these is the Disaster Leadership Group, which _x000D_
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response convenes _x000D_
and which responds to complicated emergencies. That addresses _x000D_
policy issues that will arise. In recent months, for example, _x000D_
we have convened two different Disaster Leadership Groups--one _x000D_
to address the Flint, Michigan water crisis and another to _x000D_
address the emerging Zika crisis._x000D_
    Within the domain of medical countermeasures, we have a _x000D_
very effective coordinating body, the Public Health Emergency _x000D_
Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. In my oral testimony, I _x000D_
cited some of the successes that we have demonstrated. That _x000D_
entity has really evolved----"
2926351,2926350,2926352,19242,1,"    I am going to ask you to hold it right _x000D_
there. Otherwise, these guys will never have a chance to say a _x000D_
word. Dr. Redd."
2926352,2926351,2926353,19242,1,"    There are a number of recommendations that _x000D_
pertain specifically to the CDC. I could go through those now _x000D_
or we could submit written answers to that._x000D_
    Just quickly, recommendation 15 is a collaboration with the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security on anthrax vaccination. We are _x000D_
providing the vaccine for that pilot--or would if the pilot _x000D_
started--from the Strategic National Stockpile. There is a _x000D_
recommendation to develop and implement a medical _x000D_
countermeasure response framework. We actually are working with _x000D_
State partners through the Public Health Emergency Medical _x000D_
Countermeasure Enterprise to implement improvements on the _x000D_
distribution and dispensing of the stockpile._x000D_
    There is a recommendation to allow for forward deployment _x000D_
of SNS assets. That was number 23._x000D_
    We are working closely with New York City on really kind of _x000D_
a project management formula that--when they are ready to _x000D_
administer product from the stockpile--we get it there that _x000D_
quickly--so, matching the delivery from the stockpile to the _x000D_
local capacity. And, we will be working with other health _x000D_
jurisdictions to marry their capability and our capability._x000D_
    There is a recommendation to overhaul the Select Agent _x000D_
program. I think that would kind of fall into the overall _x000D_
category of a high-level policy decision. We are doing a lot of _x000D_
work to improve the Select Agent program within our authority, _x000D_
improving the inspection process, the process to report _x000D_
incidents that are identified at the facilities, and the _x000D_
communication and transparency aspects of that._x000D_
    There actually have been 3 recent----"
2926353,2926352,2926354,19242,1,"    Dr. Redd, I am going to ask you just to _x000D_
hold it right there. What I think I am going to ask you is, for _x000D_
each answer for the record, give us the status of your _x000D_
implementation--those that you have begun implementation on, _x000D_
those that you have completed implementation on, and those you _x000D_
have no intention of implementing. And, you can also use that _x000D_
as an opportunity to respond as to whether or not you think the _x000D_
Vice President is the better person to oversee the _x000D_
implementation as opposed to Senator Booker, who I suggested as _x000D_
a possibility. When he asks his questions, maybe he can cast _x000D_
some light on it._x000D_
    But, just raise your hands. How many of you think that we _x000D_
need somebody like the Vice President who can sort of oversee _x000D_
the implementation that--without that, we are not going to make _x000D_
the kind of progress we otherwise would need? How many think _x000D_
that? If you do, raise your hand."
2926354,2926353,2926355,19242,3,"    I have lost many votes before. This is one _x000D_
that I am very happy to not win, if possible. So, I want to _x000D_
thank you very much for holding this. I think this is an urgent _x000D_
hearing and there are a lot of very consequential realities at _x000D_
stake. And, I want to thank the folks before me because your _x000D_
dedication to the health, strategy, strength, and security of _x000D_
our country is really admirable._x000D_
    I have some very New Jersey-based concerns--and, perhaps, I _x000D_
could start with Dr. Hatchett on the end. So, a lot of the _x000D_
dollars that are received through our State for homeland _x000D_
security issues are based upon formulas. The Hospital _x000D_
Preparedness Program is a program that, recently, New Jersey _x000D_
has seen a significant cut to._x000D_
    Now, it is a little incongruous to me because, in the risk _x000D_
profiles, which are calculated by the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security, we have actually seen increases in some areas. For _x000D_
example, in fiscal year 2016, the Department of Homeland _x000D_
Security recognized New Jersey's vulnerability to a targeted _x000D_
violent attack and heightened the State's risk score to _x000D_
``threat.'' DHS also raised our Urban Area Security Initiative _x000D_
(UASI) grants--UASI vulnerability, moving it from 11 to 7 on _x000D_
the risk index. So, we see that New Jersey, when it comes to _x000D_
risks--terrorist attacks, bioattacks, and the like--is getting _x000D_
more severe, but yet, at the same time, somehow, in the _x000D_
formula, we are being cut from the HPP program._x000D_
    And so, I am just wondering what the reason for the cut is, _x000D_
given that the Department of Homeland Security sees us--and you _x000D_
understand that New Jersey is--I live 10 miles from Manhattan. _x000D_
In fact, Manhattan is moving their back offices and a lot of _x000D_
their infrastructure to New Jersey, which, again, DHS sees as _x000D_
heightening our risk._x000D_
    And so, I am wondering, is this, in your opinion, _x000D_
problematic? Is it incongruent, as I see it? Or, do you see it _x000D_
in a different way?"
2926355,2926354,2926356,19242,3,"    So, I cannot speak to the particular case of _x000D_
the New Jersey allocation, but I can say that the Urban Area _x000D_
Security Initiative risk scores are figured into the Hospital _x000D_
Preparedness Program formula. And, that formula and those _x000D_
allocations are reviewed annually, and so they are adjusted _x000D_
annually._x000D_
    There are many factors other than risk score which go into _x000D_
the formula--certainly population, etc. Given that I am not, _x000D_
myself, personally responsible for the Hospital Preparedness _x000D_
Program, we can certainly get back to you with a more detailed _x000D_
response."
2926356,2926355,2926357,19242,3,"    Yes, I would really appreciate that--and, _x000D_
maybe, we can even meet on it, because if it is population, New _x000D_
Jersey is the most densely populated State in America. If it is _x000D_
critical infrastructure, we have the most dangerous, they say, _x000D_
couple of miles--there are chemical companies, you name it. I _x000D_
just do not understand how we could be going down, especially _x000D_
when other areas of the Federal Government are seeing us as _x000D_
being at a higher and higher risk for these problems. So, I _x000D_
would really appreciate it."
2926357,2926356,2926358,19242,3,"    Yes, sir. We would be glad to do that."
2926358,2926357,2926359,19242,3,"    Thank you. Thank you very much._x000D_
    Let me go really quickly over just some of my concerns, in _x000D_
general, about Zika and some of the other elements._x000D_
    Dr. Redd, can you explain to me the process for the New _x000D_
Jersey Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program, the PHEP _x000D_
Program--the award was increased this year. However, because _x000D_
the CDC is looking at additional money to allocate for Zika, we _x000D_
have seen money being taken away from the States, including New _x000D_
Jersey, which raises concerns, for me, that we are just moving _x000D_
around a finite pool that has urgent needs, as opposed to _x000D_
allocating new money, and that that might be weakening our _x000D_
preparedness. So, can you explain to me the process for cuts? _x000D_
And, were they just sort of blunt cuts across the board or _x000D_
really are we looking at the crises and the concerns for safety _x000D_
and security?"
2926359,2926358,2926360,19242,3,"    Let me start by saying that I agree with your _x000D_
underlying point, which is that this is a new threat and we _x000D_
need the supplemental appropriation to be passed--and that _x000D_
would address the problem in the way that it needs to be _x000D_
addressed."
2926360,2926359,2926361,19242,3,"    That is a very profound statement that I _x000D_
want to repeat one more time. You agree that this is a new _x000D_
threat and that we should be making supplemental new funding, _x000D_
as opposed to taking away urgently needed dollars from _x000D_
currently existing programs?"
2926361,2926360,2926362,19242,3,"    Yes, sir."
2926362,2926361,2926363,19242,3,    Thank you for that.
2926363,2926362,2926364,19242,3,    We completely agree with that.
2926364,2926363,2926365,19242,3,"    That is definitely an important statement. _x000D_
Thank you."
2926365,2926364,2926366,19242,3,"    So, in the absence of that, there is a very _x000D_
difficult decision that the Administration had to make as to _x000D_
whether we would respond to the current threat or not--and the _x000D_
only way to respond to the current threat was to identify funds _x000D_
that could be used now. I think your description of a blunt _x000D_
instrument is correct--that there was an across-the-board cut _x000D_
to the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program. It was a _x000D_
little complicated as to how each dollar amount was arrived at _x000D_
for every grantee, but every grantee lost funding."
2926366,2926365,2926367,19242,3,"    OK. But, there is obviously a better way to _x000D_
do it. Can you speak to me a little bit about--and maybe some _x000D_
other people might want to chime in. We seem to often be very _x000D_
reactive to crises. Do we have some kind of predictive _x000D_
analytics to better know what is coming before it dominates the _x000D_
headlines and fear is being--could we be doing a better job _x000D_
heading some of these crises off?"
2926367,2926366,2926368,19242,3,"    I think that is a very big challenge and I think _x000D_
it is one that we continue to work on._x000D_
    To take the particular case of Zika, there are many aspects _x000D_
of this that are unprecedented. It has been 50 years since an _x000D_
infectious disease has been identified as the cause of a birth _x000D_
defect. There has never been a birth defect caused by an _x000D_
infection transmitted by a mosquito. So, if we were to use the _x000D_
historical record, this is not something that we would have _x000D_
predicted. I think that there is a need to be able to forecast _x000D_
more effectively than we have been able to do._x000D_
    A totally different problem than with Ebola--although the _x000D_
event that occurred in West Africa was also not predicted. I _x000D_
think that for that event, had we had in place the systems that _x000D_
are being put in place now, we would not have had the event _x000D_
that we had. We might have had something that is similar to _x000D_
what we are seeing now with a very rapid detection and response _x000D_
to a problem."
2926368,2926367,2926369,19242,3,"    OK. I am going to submit one more question _x000D_
for the record because I have to go, but it is more about just _x000D_
general preparedness. I like the idea, as was said in the _x000D_
testimony, that preparedness is not an event--it is an ongoing _x000D_
process. But, I do worry about the States--having run a lot of _x000D_
tabletops for a lot of things, I worry about our overall State _x000D_
and Federal working coordination and preparation for a lot of _x000D_
the problems that I think are going to be seen more and more--_x000D_
not just here in the United States, but also threats coming _x000D_
from overseas._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926369,2926368,2926370,19242,3,"    Thank you so much, Senator Booker. Senator _x000D_
Peters."
2926370,2926369,2926371,19242,3,"    Thank you, Senator Carper. And, thank you _x000D_
to our panelists for your testimony here today. I certainly _x000D_
concur with my colleagues. We appreciate you being vigilant and _x000D_
on the job each and every day. These are serious threats, and _x000D_
we appreciate your dedication to it._x000D_
    In addition to being on HSGAC here, I also serve on the _x000D_
Commerce Committee. And, I am currently the Ranking Member on _x000D_
the Space, Science, and Competitiveness Subcommittee. I am _x000D_
currently working with Senator Cory Gardner on a working group _x000D_
that is going to be reauthorizing the America Competes Act. _x000D_
And, from my perspective, if we are going to increase our _x000D_
biodefense preparedness and work to counter diseases which can _x000D_
pose a threat--either intentionally or naturally--we need to _x000D_
fund basic scientific research and consider it both a national _x000D_
and, really, a homeland security priority for us._x000D_
    Last year, in a hearing examining the Blue Ribbon Study _x000D_
Panel on Biodefense, this Committee heard that that report _x000D_
found that federally funded scientific investigators are more _x000D_
likely to engage in early-stage research, versus in the private _x000D_
sector, where the focus is on specific product goals and end-_x000D_
user needs--and that this was a cause for Ebola medical _x000D_
countermeasures not being available when they were needed._x000D_
    When looking at the America Competes Act, the working group _x000D_
examined global biomedical research funding trends and found _x000D_
that private investment in the United States correlates very _x000D_
closely with government investment. When government investment _x000D_
in research and development (R&D) shrinks or it stagnates, the _x000D_
private sector pulls back as well. And, when government grows _x000D_
its investment, the private sector tends to follow suit. And _x000D_
yet, Federal R&D spending has fallen below 1 percent of GDP, _x000D_
which I believe is unacceptable for our future and R&D is _x000D_
important for biodefense as well as the seed corn for _x000D_
innovation._x000D_
    So, given the correlation between Federal and private _x000D_
sector investment in basic science, I am a big supporter of _x000D_
robust Federal funding for basic research and believe that _x000D_
research can certainly contribute to the next big thing--_x000D_
whatever that next big thing is. It also sparks new industries, _x000D_
creates jobs, and builds the economy, but, as we are discussing _x000D_
today, I think it also improves our biodefense preparedness as _x000D_
well. So, the challenge is in deciding the right ratio of basic _x000D_
to applied research--and appropriate funding levels for each--_x000D_
and the proper role of the private and public sectors._x000D_
    So, first, to Dr. Hatchett and Dr. Redd, could you explain _x000D_
how your agencies make use of basic science research, kind of _x000D_
your sense of where we are, where our needs are, and what you _x000D_
would like to see?"
2926371,2926370,2926372,19242,3,"    Sure. Yes, thank you for that question. Just _x000D_
to be clear, I am the Acting Director of the Biomedical _x000D_
Advanced Research and Development Authority. As our name _x000D_
implies, we work in the area of advanced research and _x000D_
development. As we understand that term, it means when we are _x000D_
working on medical countermeasures. These are medical _x000D_
countermeasures that have reached the clinical stage of _x000D_
development, where many of the problems relate to the clinical _x000D_
testing of the product as well as to scaling up manufacturing _x000D_
and working out manufacturing issues, so that we can be able to _x000D_
produce the products on a large scale._x000D_
    We have to depend on our colleagues at the National _x000D_
Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense to fund that _x000D_
basic research. We do not fund basic research. And, it is very _x000D_
important for us to coordinate our efforts with them so that, _x000D_
as they cultivate products and bring products forward through _x000D_
the earlier stages of discovery and development, we are ready _x000D_
to transition those products to advanced development._x000D_
    In the case of the Ebola vaccines--and Ebola therapeutics, _x000D_
for that matter--Ebola obviously had been on our threat list _x000D_
for some time. It is one of the material threats that the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security has identified. NIH and the _x000D_
Department of Defense had been supporting basic research on _x000D_
countermeasures and had been moving those countermeasures _x000D_
forward through the development cycle._x000D_
    When the Ebola epidemic started in 2014, none of those _x000D_
products had reached the stage where our organization was--that _x000D_
they were ready to be developed by our organization. Within a _x000D_
very short span of time, within about a year, we were able to _x000D_
transition 12 products from that preclinical development to _x000D_
advanced development--and many of those products have actually _x000D_
been tested in West Africa. So, we do have a strong system as _x000D_
it relates to biodefense for supporting product development and _x000D_
translating products from basic research--and I could not agree _x000D_
with you more about the importance of basic research."
2926372,2926371,2926373,19242,3,    Thank you. Dr. Redd.
2926373,2926372,2926374,19242,3,"    Yes, sir. If we had a panelist from NIH, you _x000D_
would have kind of a good description of the proportion of _x000D_
basic research and the proportion of applied research and _x000D_
practical application. So we do some basic research ourselves, _x000D_
but, predominantly, our mission is to protect the health of the _x000D_
public and to use the tools that are available to make sure _x000D_
they are effective and to make sure that they are disseminated. _x000D_
So, we are more on the end-user side of that spectrum from _x000D_
basic research to use."
2926374,2926373,2926375,19242,3,"    I realize that, but, I guess, the follow-up _x000D_
question is: So do you believe that we need to be putting more _x000D_
into basic research, as these threats seem to be developing, _x000D_
and, in some ways, at an accelerating rate--that we are _x000D_
probably doing ourselves a disservice if we are not putting _x000D_
more resources into the very foundational level of science?"
2926375,2926374,2926376,19242,3,"    I think we do. I think we also need to make sure _x000D_
that we do not have a bottleneck at that development stage and _x000D_
we are able to get things through the system quickly to find _x000D_
out if they are going to be useful in large populations and be _x000D_
effective. And, some of those kinds of questions are difficult _x000D_
or are not possible to answer at the basic level."
2926376,2926375,2926377,19242,3,"    Right. Would any of the other panelists _x000D_
like to weigh in?"
2926377,2926376,2926378,19242,3,"    Sure. At the Department of Homeland Security, _x000D_
we have the Science and Technology Directorate, and it is _x000D_
critical to helping the Department meet the needs of its _x000D_
stakeholders--whether they are first responders--helping make _x000D_
improvements to the BioWatch program--and it relies on a _x000D_
diverse university program as well--the ``Centers of _x000D_
Excellence'' to help us meet those needs. And, just recently--_x000D_
since we have been talking about Ebola--some basic _x000D_
understanding that has significant ramifications for biodefense _x000D_
have to be answered still. So, some of the questions were: How _x000D_
persistent is Ebola on surfaces? How long does it remain _x000D_
infectious? And so, in a study that was conducted with our _x000D_
partners, we were trying to understand what it does on the _x000D_
carpet of an airplane or on surfaces that our employees might _x000D_
encounter in an airport._x000D_
    And so, this kind of basic research has real, serious _x000D_
implications for our day-to-day operations--so it is critical."
2926378,2926377,2926379,19242,3,"    Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you very _x000D_
much."
2926379,2926378,2926380,19242,3,"    Thank you, Senator Peters._x000D_
    Looking at the list of folks, Senators Ayotte and Tester _x000D_
were here when the gavel came down. They may come back. Next on _x000D_
the list is Senator Ernst. If we are looking for somebody who _x000D_
has previous military experience, a colonel--and maybe you _x000D_
could be next for us. Then, Ben Sasse, if he returns, and then _x000D_
Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill."
2926380,2926379,2926381,19242,3,"    Thank you, Ranking Member. I appreciate it. _x000D_
And thank you, gentlemen, for being with us today._x000D_
    This question is for anyone on the panel, please. I want to _x000D_
follow up on a question that was asked earlier by Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper. One of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on _x000D_
Biodefense's top recommendations was the development and _x000D_
implementation of a comprehensive national biodefense strategy. _x000D_
This Administration has failed to present a comprehensive _x000D_
strategy in a number of areas--whether it is defeating the _x000D_
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or countering the use of _x000D_
social media--which has led to disparate efforts that lack _x000D_
focus. And, as the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense _x000D_
concluded, the United States is underprepared for biological _x000D_
threats and it is critical that the Administration establish a _x000D_
comprehensive biodefense strategy._x000D_
    Could Mr. Currie or anyone else on the panel speak to the _x000D_
importance of this recommendation?"
2926381,2926380,2926382,19242,3,"    Yes, ma'am. Absolutely, we think it is very _x000D_
important--and our findings and recommendations have been _x000D_
really similar to the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense's _x000D_
findings and recommendations._x000D_
    I think it is important to note that it is not easy. Part _x000D_
of the reason it is so difficult to do this--and this links _x000D_
also to their recommendation of providing the Vice President _x000D_
the authority to do this--is because it has to come at a level _x000D_
that is above the cabinet and the Department level because _x000D_
Departments cannot tell other Departments what to do. It is _x000D_
very difficult to allocate resources between the Departments _x000D_
and identify resources priorities--for example, deciding that _x000D_
we want less resources in one Department's program versus more _x000D_
in another. And, that is exactly why such a global national _x000D_
strategy across the Federal Government is so important. But, it _x000D_
is very difficult to do."
2926382,2926381,2926383,19242,3,"    Yes, and we understand the difficulty, but _x000D_
also the importance and necessity of doing that._x000D_
    Would anyone else like to respond?"
2926383,2926382,2926384,19242,3,"    Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the question. While _x000D_
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and _x000D_
Response has not developed a strategy for the parameters that _x000D_
are described in that report, I do think it is important to _x000D_
point out that they did leave the development of a National _x000D_
Health Security Strategy. The first National Health Security _x000D_
Strategy was completed in December 2009 and an updated version _x000D_
of the strategy was completed in December 2014._x000D_
    The National Health Security Strategy is a broader _x000D_
strategy. It does not just look at biodefense. It also focuses _x000D_
on securing the Nation's health security--as the title implies. _x000D_
It has 5 major strategic objectives. The first is to promote _x000D_
the development of resilient communities that are capable of _x000D_
responding to incidents of all kinds, including biodefense-_x000D_
related threats. The second is to promote the development of a _x000D_
robust medical countermeasures enterprise. The third is to _x000D_
promote comprehensive health situational awareness, so that _x000D_
decisionmakers can respond appropriately. The fourth is to _x000D_
promote integration of public health, health care, and _x000D_
emergency management systems across the Nation at the different _x000D_
levels of government. And, the last strategic objective is to _x000D_
promote global health security, so that we can address issues _x000D_
like the Ebola epidemic._x000D_
    So, that is an overarching strategy that governs a great _x000D_
deal of what we do in biodefense. And, in developing that _x000D_
strategy, we did work with stakeholders at all levels of _x000D_
government and with our interagency partners."
2926384,2926383,2926385,19242,3,"    That is wonderful. Very good. Great first _x000D_
step._x000D_
    For Administrator Shea, thank you very much for being here. _x000D_
How do we integrate information about animal and human health _x000D_
without creating or perpetuating misunderstandings and fear _x000D_
among consumers, both here at home and abroad? We do see this, _x000D_
where, perhaps, the Chinese or other governments will push away _x000D_
any commodities, like produce that they feel might do them _x000D_
harm--or they can make that up. So, what are your thoughts on _x000D_
that?"
2926385,2926384,2926386,19242,3,"    I think it is very important that we stick to the _x000D_
science and we work with our colleagues on the human health _x000D_
side to be clear about the science. And, a really good example _x000D_
of that, of course, that affected your State, was what was _x000D_
being called ``swine flu'' in about 2009, when we should have _x000D_
called it by its proper scientific name, ``novel influenza A _x000D_
(H1N1).'' And, it is so important to do that because the _x000D_
industry, which so important in Iowa, of course, was put at a _x000D_
real disadvantage because of the fear of an influenza that _x000D_
really should not have been attributed only to swine. So, that _x000D_
is why it is so important that the science be integrated and _x000D_
that we speak with science. And, that is why I think it is _x000D_
important that we have someone embedded at CDC--which we do--_x000D_
and that we work, on a daily basis, to make sure those messages _x000D_
go back and forth."
2926386,2926385,2926387,19242,3,"    Very good. And, also, you spoke about the _x000D_
swine flu. We can talk a little bit about the avian flu, but, _x000D_
yes, go ahead, sir."
2926387,2926386,2926388,19242,3,"    Thank you. I also wanted to point out that _x000D_
there are some robust communications that go on between these _x000D_
entities. Within our center, we actually also have a liaison _x000D_
with APHIS within the USDA, and it has proved to be critical _x000D_
for producing this ``One Health'' message. And, in one case _x000D_
just this last fall, we were seeing some erroneous news reports _x000D_
come up about a resurgence of avian influenza that just were _x000D_
not at all accurate. But, working through the National Wildlife _x000D_
Health Center (NWHC), also with the Department of Interior, as _x000D_
well as our colleague at APHIS with the USDA, we are really _x000D_
able to push through those agencies, able to tamp down these _x000D_
stories, and really able to prevent a story from gaining legs _x000D_
that could have economic consequences._x000D_
    And, so I think that the ``One Health'' approach is so _x000D_
critical to everything that we do--and we need to continue to _x000D_
bridge this divide."
2926388,2926387,2926389,19242,3,"    Great. Yes, sir?"
2926389,2926388,2926390,19242,3,"    Just briefly--to support the Administrator here, _x000D_
we have a very intense scientific interchange with USDA on _x000D_
influenza and also for foodborne diseases. So, there are some _x000D_
pockets of just very close collaboration."
2926390,2926389,2926391,19242,3,"    Very good. Well, I appreciate that so much. _x000D_
And, we spoke about this earlier--or we heard about it _x000D_
earlier--but, as you know, last year the poultry sector was _x000D_
rocked by the Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), _x000D_
commonly called ``bird flu.'' And, this was very devastating in _x000D_
Iowa, where it resulted in the death of over 30 million birds _x000D_
and inflicted $1 billion of damage to our economy in Iowa. It _x000D_
was one of the worst foreign animal disease outbreaks in our _x000D_
Nation's history. And, the livestock sector is also regularly _x000D_
impacted by these diseases--and they struggle to control them--_x000D_
with new ones popping up each year. We have talked about some _x000D_
of that. And, it is not inconceivable that an ill-intentioned _x000D_
actor could purposefully introduce an equally dangerous and _x000D_
contagious pathogen into the United States to really mess with _x000D_
our food security, our trading relationships, and our economic _x000D_
security._x000D_
    And, I know I am going a little over time, but, to that _x000D_
end, what is the USDA doing to prepare for the threat of _x000D_
bioterrorism? Can you give us a broad overview on that?"
2926391,2926390,2926392,19242,3,"    Mr. Shea, I am going to ask you to suspend _x000D_
your answer just for a second. I am very much interested in _x000D_
your answer, but Senator Portman has a dead stop right now and _x000D_
he needs to go."
2926392,2926391,2926393,19242,3,    OK.
2926393,2926392,2926394,19242,3,"    If we can just yield to him for a moment, _x000D_
and then we will go back to you."
2926394,2926393,2926395,19242,3,    Thank you. Yes.
2926395,2926394,2926396,19242,3,    Thank you.
2926396,2926395,2926397,19242,3,"    Thank you, Senator Ernst, and thank you, _x000D_
Senator Carper, and thank you for having this hearing--you and _x000D_
the Chairman. This is an incredibly important area. I have a _x000D_
number of questions I am going to be submitting for the record, _x000D_
probably to each of you--at least to three of you--as I see you _x000D_
there. But, I want to focus on a single issue, Dr. Hatchett, if _x000D_
I could. We talked a lot about Ebola today. We have also talked _x000D_
about the Zika virus. And, they are very different. My _x000D_
understanding is that the way in which someone becomes _x000D_
contagious with Ebola creates a health problem in and of _x000D_
itself, whereas, with Zika, it is not as easily transmitted _x000D_
from person to person. However, it is transmitted from _x000D_
mosquitoes to people very easily. And, I just wonder what you _x000D_
think we could do, in terms of leveraging all of our assets--_x000D_
including one that happens to be situated in Youngstown, Ohio, _x000D_
which is the 910th. It is the airlift wing there that provides _x000D_
aerial spraying for our country. They do incredible work on our _x000D_
firing ranges. They do work with regard to oil spills. But, _x000D_
they also do work with regard to mosquito infestations. Do they _x000D_
have a role here with regard to Zika, particularly, in spring _x000D_
in the southern part of the country, where we can see, _x000D_
unfortunately, a movement from Latin America up toward the _x000D_
United States?"
2926397,2926396,2926398,19242,3,"    Senator, thank you for that question. Vector _x000D_
control, which is what you are referring to, in terms of _x000D_
controlling mosquito populations, is an area that CDC, I think, _x000D_
has primary responsibility for, so, if I could yield to my _x000D_
colleague to let him address your question."
2926398,2926397,2926399,19242,3,"    It is hard to give a global answer to that _x000D_
question. The variability of mosquito control districts in the _x000D_
United States is remarkable. Some localities have really finely _x000D_
honed enterprises, while others have hardly any at all. I think _x000D_
that there could be a role for that airwing in locations that _x000D_
do not have the capability and need it._x000D_
    Something that we think is really important, that the Zika _x000D_
virus outbreak is pointing out, is the need to really _x000D_
revitalize those mosquito control efforts--not only for _x000D_
control, but really just to understand what is going on--that _x000D_
part of what those mosquito control districts do is capture _x000D_
mosquitoes and speciate them, and we just do not have the _x000D_
information that we need right now in the United States to make _x000D_
the best decisions."
2926399,2926398,2926400,19242,3,"    Well, thank you, Dr. Redd, and thank you, _x000D_
Senators. I want you to know the 910th is ready and willing--_x000D_
and they, again, do outstanding work. And, I think it would be _x000D_
a way to leverage some of those DOD assets to address a very _x000D_
real, potential biological issue that we are currently facing--_x000D_
just as we did with Ebola over the last couple of years._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926400,2926399,2926401,19242,3,    Senator Ernst.
2926401,2926400,2926402,19242,3,"    Thank you, Ranking Member. I will go ahead _x000D_
and just submit the questions for the record in the interest of _x000D_
time."
2926402,2926401,2926403,19242,3,"    Well, go ahead and respond to the question. _x000D_
It was a good question."
2926403,2926402,2926404,19242,3,    I have a hard stop also.
2926404,2926403,2926405,19242,3,"    That is OK. I would like to hear the _x000D_
answer, and then we will go--actually, it is a great question, _x000D_
so go ahead. Just briefly."
2926405,2926404,2926406,19242,3,"    Yes, bioterrorism efforts."
2926406,2926405,2926407,19242,3,"    OK. Of course, we work very closely with our _x000D_
colleagues in Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection _x000D_
(CBP), who actually conduct inspections of things and people as _x000D_
they are coming into the country. So, that is our very first _x000D_
line of defense--looking for things._x000D_
    But, after that, what is important, of course, is finding _x000D_
any outbreak quickly. And so, surveillance is really the key. _x000D_
We have surveillance on farms, in markets, and in feedlots--_x000D_
everywhere. And, that surveillance comes not only from USDA _x000D_
people, but, more abundantly, from State people and from _x000D_
private veterinarians who we accredit at USDA. And, when they _x000D_
find a disease, they are duty-bound to report that to us. So, _x000D_
that is really the key--surveillance, prevention, keeping these _x000D_
things out of the country, and getting on it right away._x000D_
    Some other things that are going on, of course--at DHS, _x000D_
they are developing countermeasures at the Plum Island Animal _x000D_
Disease Center (PIADC)--soon to be relocated, but they are _x000D_
working very hard there to find countermeasures and detection _x000D_
methods. So, all of those things are in place now."
2926407,2926406,2926408,19242,3,"    Just to follow up with that then, as we are _x000D_
preparing for potential incidents, is it important that we have _x000D_
stockpiles of vaccinations or other veterinary supplies then, _x000D_
to safeguard?"
2926408,2926407,2926409,19242,3,"    Absolutely. We do have a veterinary stockpile, _x000D_
but it certainly is not robust enough to handle a really huge _x000D_
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, for example. We do have a _x000D_
good capacity now for the avian influenza vaccine, but we do _x000D_
not have a huge stockpile of some of the others."
2926409,2926408,2926410,19242,3,    Thank you.
2926410,2926409,2926411,19242,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I understand that there are several advisory committees _x000D_
involved in the material threat assessment process and the _x000D_
material threat determination process that include _x000D_
nongovernmental experts. These determinations are, in fact, the _x000D_
guidance that DHS uses when considering a particular chemical, _x000D_
biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon to be a threat and _x000D_
allows HHS to use the BioShield funding for countermeasure _x000D_
procurements._x000D_
    So, my question to you, Doctor, is: Is anyone on these _x000D_
committees associated with any of the companies that are _x000D_
actually getting the funds for the research and development on _x000D_
possible countermeasures?"
2926411,2926410,2926412,19242,3,"    The Science and Technology Directorate is the _x000D_
organization that runs the terrorism risk assessments and the _x000D_
material threat assessments. While I have been involved in the _x000D_
process, I am not knowledgeable as to the membership that they _x000D_
rely on when they put those together."
2926412,2926411,2926413,19242,3,"    If you would get that for the record, _x000D_
that would be helpful."
2926413,2926412,2926414,19242,3,"    I will, absolutely."
2926414,2926413,2926415,19242,3,"    I have had a hearing on this, in _x000D_
previous years, with the person that you just referenced and _x000D_
was frustrated with what I thought--and I am going to go into _x000D_
that a little bit because I think it is relevant to the hearing _x000D_
today--about what we are warehousing and why, as well as what _x000D_
we are spending money on._x000D_
    If you look at the funding decisions, the priorities, and _x000D_
the tradeoffs, we spent $1.4 billion on anthrax _x000D_
countermeasures, alone. 2 of the investments were for anthrax _x000D_
antitoxins that cost $3,100 and $8,200 per dose. We also bought _x000D_
10 million doses of BioThrax, which only has a 4-year shelf _x000D_
life. And, we bought that vaccine in 2005. And then, we bought _x000D_
another 18.75 million doses 2 years later. Now, all of that _x000D_
money is--I mean, I understand you have to spend money to be _x000D_
prepared, even if you do not use it. I get that. But, it _x000D_
appears to me that anthrax investment is crowding out other _x000D_
countermeasures in terms of funding. And, I would like someone _x000D_
to address that, because, while we had one anthrax attack, it _x000D_
seems to me that the cupboard is bare in a lot of other areas _x000D_
where we need to have BioShield funds being used. And, I would _x000D_
appreciate it if someone would address that, especially since _x000D_
Dr. Lurie, when I talked to her about anthrax, basically said _x000D_
that it is a therapeutic that, potentially, could be effective _x000D_
against an antibiotic-resistant anthrax infection. There was _x000D_
not even certainty that it would be. Dr. Hatchett."
2926415,2926414,2926416,19242,3,"    Yes, ma'am. Good to see you, ma'am. Thank you _x000D_
for the question. Your question has multiple parts. I will try _x000D_
to be brief and address all of them._x000D_
    With respect to the anthrax antitoxins, we do have very _x000D_
limited treatments for anthrax disease. And, we now have 3 _x000D_
licensed anthrax antitoxins, so FDA has judged that, based on _x000D_
the best available evidence, those products are likely to be _x000D_
safe, effective, and produce a survival benefit against _x000D_
anthrax. Anthrax certainly is one of our top threats--and we _x000D_
have made very substantial investments to secure the Nation _x000D_
against future anthrax attacks._x000D_
    To address your question about whether it is crowding out _x000D_
other products, I have to say it is not. We--as the Office of _x000D_
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response--as you _x000D_
know, are the stewards of the Project BioShield funding. Over _x000D_
the last 12 years, we have added 17 products to the Strategic _x000D_
National Stockpile using Project BioShield funding. Those _x000D_
products include products, yes, to treat anthrax--both vaccines _x000D_
and antitoxins--but also antivirals and vaccines to treat _x000D_
smallpox, antitoxins to treat botulism, drugs and treatments _x000D_
for acute radiation syndrome (ARS), exposure to chemical nerve _x000D_
agents, and, most recently, we have added 4 products to the _x000D_
Strategic National Stockpile to address the risk of thermal _x000D_
burns that could be associated with explosions, bombings, or _x000D_
the detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND)._x000D_
    We have a number of new products that we will be procuring _x000D_
this year. We anticipate adding as many as 5 new products to _x000D_
the Strategic National Stockpile this year. Only 2 of those are _x000D_
for anthrax, but they also include treatments for smallpox and _x000D_
acute radiation syndrome. And, we may add as many as 5 new _x000D_
products next year._x000D_
    So, we have been able to buildup a diverse portfolio of _x000D_
medical countermeasures against CBRN threats."
2926416,2926415,2926417,19242,3,"    Does the smallpox purchase include _x000D_
IMVAMUNE?"
2926417,2926416,2926418,19242,3,"    We have purchased significant amounts of _x000D_
IMVAMUNE over the last several years."
2926418,2926417,2926419,19242,3,"    Is it not a problem that a scientific _x000D_
journal, ``Biosecurity and Bioterrorism,'' said, unequivocally, _x000D_
that there is no apparent programmatic use for this vaccine at _x000D_
this time? In fact, 7 years after the initial procurement, it _x000D_
is not recommended--the advisory group--the World Health _x000D_
Organization's advisory group--said it is not recommended for _x000D_
emergency use."
2926419,2926418,2926420,19242,3,"    I would respectfully disagree with the _x000D_
statement that it has no programmatic use. IMVAMUNE was _x000D_
created, specifically, to be a vaccine that we could give to _x000D_
immuno-compromised populations or persons who had relative _x000D_
contraindications for the existing smallpox vaccine--and that _x000D_
includes persons with a history of atopic dermatitis. That is a _x000D_
substantial number of people who could have a potentially _x000D_
severe reaction to the other available smallpox vaccines."
2926420,2926419,2926421,19242,3,"    That makes sense. I just am concerned _x000D_
because the World Health Organization's scientific advisory _x000D_
group of experts noted, in 2014, that it was not recommended _x000D_
for emergency use--and we have spent $650 million on it. I hope _x000D_
that would always raise the hackles of somebody sitting in this _x000D_
chair who is trying to figure out what is going on. I mean, why _x000D_
are we spending that kind of money when, clearly, there are _x000D_
real questions about its efficacy and its Section 5."
2926421,2926420,2926422,19242,3,"    We also have very substantial stockpiles of _x000D_
the Acambis vaccine, which can be administered in an emergency _x000D_
use setting. The potential concern about the IMVAMUNE vaccine _x000D_
is that it requires 2 doses to achieve immunity. For those _x000D_
people who have been exposed to persons with known smallpox, _x000D_
there is no absolute contraindication for the existing vaccine. _x000D_
And, if it is given up to 3 or 4 days after exposure, it can _x000D_
protect individuals who have been exposed to smallpox, and so, _x000D_
that may be the basis of that discussion. But, IMVAMUNE clearly _x000D_
is efficacious and clearly meets an unmet medical need for a _x000D_
large segment of the population."
2926422,2926421,2926423,19242,3,"    I know I am out of time. I have one _x000D_
more. Do you mind?"
2926423,2926422,2926424,19242,3,    You are doing a good job.
2926424,2926423,2926425,19242,3,"    I want to make sure that we have time._x000D_
    I get that we are reliant on small start-up companies for _x000D_
developing some of these drugs because of the nature of the _x000D_
market and the nature of the research. And, the economics do _x000D_
not make sense for some of the big guys. So, I get that we have _x000D_
to fund a lot of this. But, what I do not get is--take ABthrax, _x000D_
for example. We gave Human Genome Sciences $130 million for _x000D_
late-stage development activities to support approval of the _x000D_
product, including support for non-clinical, clinical, and _x000D_
manufacturing facilities--as well as funds for the licensing _x000D_
and approval process. I mean, this was our baby--the taxpayers' _x000D_
baby._x000D_
    Well, then we have to turn around and buy it from them for _x000D_
$3,000 a dose. Most people in Missouri do not understand that--_x000D_
why we would pay for the development of a drug and then have to _x000D_
pay $3,000 a pop for the drug after we paid to develop it."
2926425,2926424,2926426,19242,3,    So----
2926426,2926425,2926427,19242,3,    Good question.
2926427,2926426,2926428,19242,3,"    Yes, it is a good question. I will say that _x000D_
the pricing of medical countermeasures is complex. A factor _x000D_
that we have to take into consideration is that, because these _x000D_
products do not have commercial markets, we have to provide a _x000D_
sustaining revenue that will allow for the manufacturing base _x000D_
to remain intact. And, the price that you quoted for a _x000D_
monoclonal antibody therapeutic is very clearly in the middle _x000D_
of the range for other--there are dozens of licensed monoclonal _x000D_
antibody therapeutics for many other indications, and the _x000D_
prices for those products range from slightly less than the _x000D_
amount that you mentioned to substantially more. So, I would _x000D_
argue that it is a fair price for the product."
2926428,2926427,2926429,19242,3,"    Have we explored whether it would be _x000D_
cheaper to do this ourselves? We are paying them to develop the _x000D_
drug, and then we are the only customer, and so, we are _x000D_
continuing to pay them--I mean, it seems like, to me, that we _x000D_
are guaranteeing a profit for something that is wholly owned by _x000D_
the government."
2926429,2926428,2926430,19242,3,"    If I could just say that we do look at _x000D_
different business models for how we support biodefense _x000D_
countermeasures. In a related domain, for emerging infectious _x000D_
diseases, we have a similar market failure problem. And, we are _x000D_
thinking through different potential approaches to how we can _x000D_
support companies and how far we would like the private sector _x000D_
to carry products and, potentially, what options we may have to _x000D_
ensure that we can have those products when we need them--which _x000D_
might include the scenario you mentioned._x000D_
    Senator, if I could mention another thing that I think you _x000D_
would be interested in. In framing your question initially, you _x000D_
did talk about the shelf life of products. And, BARDA does have _x000D_
a total life-cycle cost containment initiative that we have _x000D_
been supporting for many years, where we look at the products _x000D_
that we are developing and try to find ways to reduce that _x000D_
long-term carrying cost to the taxpayer. And so, for example, _x000D_
you mentioned the IMVAMUNE product--the smallpox vaccine. BARDA _x000D_
has supported the development of a lyophilized--or freeze-_x000D_
dried--version of that product which will have a longer shelf _x000D_
life----"
2926430,2926429,2926431,19242,3,"    Which will help the shelf life--that is _x000D_
terrific."
2926431,2926430,2926432,19242,3,"    And, we are doing that across the board. And, _x000D_
we are looking across our entire portfolio to see how we can _x000D_
reduce those costs."
2926432,2926431,2926433,19242,3,"    Well, I have been involved in this other _x000D_
investigation where a guy named Martin Shkreli figured out that _x000D_
there was a limited market for a certain drug, and he went out _x000D_
and bought it, and then he jacked the price up. So, maybe, we _x000D_
need to take a page out of his book and jack the price down. _x000D_
Maybe, we figure out what the price is to buy the drug that we _x000D_
paid to develop and continue to manufacture it ourselves and _x000D_
drive that cost way down, because, now, we are taking out the _x000D_
profit that the private company is making from our investment. _x000D_
I mean, believe me, I do not quarrel with a private company _x000D_
being able to make money off of their investment. But, it seems _x000D_
weird that we are making the investment and then they can _x000D_
profit off of theirs for the life of the company. That is the _x000D_
kind of deal that any businessman would like to get."
2926433,2926432,2926434,19242,3,"    Yes, ma'am, thank you. We are always looking _x000D_
at ways that we can be better stewards of the taxpayers' money. _x000D_
We recognize our responsibility and we recognize that we do _x000D_
provide a great deal of that up-front investment. And so, we _x000D_
can take that for----"
2926434,2926433,2926435,19242,3,"    Yes, I would love you to take a look at _x000D_
that, because I am not sure this business model makes a lot of _x000D_
sense for the taxpayers."
2926435,2926434,2926436,19242,3,    Thank you.
2926436,2926435,2926437,19242,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2926437,2926436,2926438,19242,3,"    Thank you, Senator McCaskill. Senator _x000D_
Carper."
2926438,2926437,2926439,19242,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    I want to come back to Mr. Shea. Just briefly, I want to _x000D_
follow up on Senator Ernst's question with respect to the avian _x000D_
influenza outbreak. Senator Johnson's State was hit hard--and a _x000D_
number of other States in the Midwest were hit hard--especially _x000D_
their turkeys and laying hens, and we saw that happen, I think, _x000D_
between November 2014 and May and June of last year. And, we _x000D_
fully expected the East Coast--the ``Atlantic Flyway''--to be _x000D_
hit this winter--and it just has not happened. And, we have _x000D_
been pretty good with biosecurity. But, why do you think we _x000D_
have escaped this blow?"
2926439,2926438,2926440,19242,3,"    Of course, all of the scientists will tell me it _x000D_
is all speculative, but some of the reasons seem to be _x000D_
something like this:_x000D_
    First, the virus circulating in the water fowl may have _x000D_
mutated to a less virulent form, and, therefore, when they are _x000D_
dropping the virus, it is simply not catching on like it did _x000D_
last year in a highly pathogenic form. So that is a _x000D_
possibility._x000D_
    Another possibility is that the biosecurity has improved--_x000D_
and I think it has improved dramatically, certainly in _x000D_
Delmarva, where poultry is so important, and throughout the _x000D_
Midwest and all of the places where poultry is. And, poultry is _x000D_
in so many places, of course. I think biosecurity is much _x000D_
better._x000D_
    So, I think those are some of the things that seem to have _x000D_
led to it."
2926440,2926439,2926441,19242,3,"    All right. Thank you._x000D_
    I do not know who to ask this question to, but I will start _x000D_
with you, Dr. Redd. Would you talk to us about what the _x000D_
difference--or similarity--is between how Ebola is transmitted _x000D_
from 1 human being to another, as compared to the Zika virus, _x000D_
please?"
2926441,2926440,2926442,19242,3,"    Sure. I will start with Zika. It can be _x000D_
transmitted by an infected mosquito, it can be transmitted by _x000D_
sexual transmission, and it, probably, can be transmitted by _x000D_
blood transfusion. There is no instance where that has _x000D_
occurred, but it is a possibility based on the way other _x000D_
similar viruses can be transmitted in blood._x000D_
    Ebola is not transmitted by mosquitoes. It can be _x000D_
transmitted by sexual transmission, but its primary route of _x000D_
transmission is through contact. So, by coming into physical _x000D_
contact with the body secretions of a person who is infected--_x000D_
where the virus multiplies to very high titers--and then, it is _x000D_
really just through that direct contact."
2926442,2926441,2926443,19242,3,"    Thank you. The CDC announced this week, as _x000D_
was described earlier, that the Zika virus is now confirmed to _x000D_
be a source of significant brain damage to developing fetuses. _x000D_
There are a lot of policy consequences that flow from that. _x000D_
But, just take a minute or 2 and talk to us about what actually _x000D_
happens to the brain of--and it does not happen to all pregnant _x000D_
women. Why is that? But, what is actually happening in the _x000D_
brain of the developing fetus? And, what is the capability--if _x000D_
a child is born alive, what are some of the consequences there?"
2926443,2926442,2926444,19242,3,"    So, a couple of points. This declaration is not _x000D_
changing what we are doing. Actually, part of the reason behind _x000D_
making this declaration was to try to make it easier to move _x000D_
quickly and, particularly, to take away any of the confusion _x000D_
people might be having when they are deciding whether or not _x000D_
they should put insect repellent on. There is no question, now, _x000D_
that those preventive measures are very important to prevent _x000D_
something that is confirmed._x000D_
    When a fetus is infected, the brain is actually infected, _x000D_
and that was--an early finding was actual--on microscopic _x000D_
slides, you can see brain tissue and the virus right there. _x000D_
What we think happens is that the brain actually--because of _x000D_
this infection--actually shrinks, so that you have a normal _x000D_
fetus, then there is an infection--that brain gets infected and _x000D_
it gets smaller--and that is what causes the small heads._x000D_
    It is actually--even though the term ``microcephaly'' just _x000D_
means small head, the kind of--in these severe cases, it is _x000D_
actually a very particular kind of malformation that was very _x000D_
rare up until this point, where the plates of the skull of the _x000D_
fetus are actually overlapped because of that collapse. The _x000D_
skin has ridges in it--and that is not part of kind of regular _x000D_
microcephaly. So, it is actually a very specific finding._x000D_
    Now, even though there is evidence that the Zika virus _x000D_
causes this malformation, there are many questions--and you _x000D_
actually pointed out several of them. It does not seem that _x000D_
every pregnant woman who gets bitten by a mosquito has this _x000D_
very severe adverse effect--and we do not know why that is. We _x000D_
do not really know--there is a likelihood that there is a _x000D_
certain time during pregnancy that poses the greatest risk. _x000D_
That is a little bit of the speculation. We also suspect that _x000D_
there are other adverse events that can occur, which is typical _x000D_
of other birth defects. They rarely are just a single thing. _x000D_
And, we do not really have good information on that entire _x000D_
spectrum of disease."
2926444,2926443,2926445,19242,3,"    Do we have any idea of the degree to which _x000D_
a baby born with this disease--this brain disease that you have _x000D_
described--to what extent does it impair their ability to _x000D_
function?"
2926445,2926444,2926446,19242,3,"    It really depends on the severity--and that is _x000D_
the question of the spectrum of illness. For the ones that are _x000D_
very severely affected, I mean, there are deaths right at the _x000D_
time of birth. So, that would be kind of the extreme--or deaths _x000D_
before birth. And, I think you can go all the way down the _x000D_
line--that there may be much less severe findings in what, _x000D_
right now, look like normal births."
2926446,2926445,2926447,19242,3,"    OK. And, for the panel, a last question. _x000D_
What good, just common-sense, practical advice can you give to _x000D_
people who are going to be traveling to parts of this country _x000D_
or to other countries, and are concerned about possible _x000D_
infection? What good advice can you give people?"
2926447,2926446,2926448,19242,3,"    Well, our advice--that has expanded to include _x000D_
more places where the virus is actively being transmitted--is _x000D_
if you are pregnant, it is probably not a good idea to go. If _x000D_
you do go, use mosquito-prevention measures--an effective _x000D_
insect repellent, insecticide on your clothes, long sleeves, _x000D_
light-colored clothing, and do what you can to avoid being _x000D_
bitten by a mosquito."
2926448,2926447,2926449,19242,3,    Any other advice from anybody else?
2926449,2926448,2926450,19242,4,"    Thank you, Senator Carper._x000D_
    Just really quickly, there is only 1 species of mosquito _x000D_
that carries this. Is that true or not?"
2926450,2926449,2926451,19242,4,"    There is 1 vector that is presumed to be the _x000D_
predominant vector. They are both Aedes mosquitoes. There is _x000D_
Aedes aegypti, which is thought to be the predominant vector. _x000D_
Aedes albopictus is thought to possibly also be a vector."
2926451,2926450,2926452,19242,4,"    So, what is the status of the program to _x000D_
use genetically modified mosquitoes to, basically, make the _x000D_
population sterile in order to reduce the population of those?"
2926452,2926451,2926453,19242,4,"    I will have to get back to you with the specifics _x000D_
on that. I think there are a number of--well, there is a _x000D_
programmatic approach of using indoor residual and outdoor _x000D_
residual spraying that is being used in Puerto Rico for _x000D_
pregnant women to prevent mosquitoes--basically killing _x000D_
mosquitoes right there--and also putting larvicides in _x000D_
potential breeding spaces of those mosquitoes as well as _x000D_
removing potential breeding spaces._x000D_
    There are a number of kind of experimental--or less _x000D_
widespread--uses, and, in all of this, we really need to learn _x000D_
the effectiveness of these measures because this is a very _x000D_
difficult mosquito--not to kill at an individual level, but to _x000D_
be sure that there are enough mosquitoes being killed to reduce _x000D_
transmissions."
2926453,2926452,2926454,19242,4,"    OK. Can anybody else speak to the status _x000D_
of using genetically modified--OK. So, it is just experimental _x000D_
at best._x000D_
    Let me close out the hearing. I will just kind of go down _x000D_
the panel. Based on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense's _x000D_
conclusion that we do not have a strategy--we do not have any _x000D_
kind of functioning leadership here, both budgetary as well as _x000D_
operational--you are all involved in these organizations. I _x000D_
have been at organizations that have a very well defined _x000D_
strategy and you know it. I have been at organizations that do _x000D_
not have a strategy--I am kind of in one right now--where you _x000D_
also know it. So, I want to get your evaluation and--if you are _x000D_
saying you agree with GAO--if you agree with the Blue Ribbon _x000D_
Study Panel on Biodefense, you do not have to say a whole lot _x000D_
more. But, if you disagree, just quickly tell me--what is the _x000D_
disconnect, in terms of what GAO and the Blue Ribbon Study _x000D_
Panel on Biodefense are talking about--a lack of strategy, a _x000D_
lack of coordination, and a lack of unity of effort? I will _x000D_
start with you, Dr. Hatchett."
2926454,2926453,2926455,19242,4,"    Thank you. I think the problem of biodefense _x000D_
is a tremendously far-reaching problem, and it stretches to all _x000D_
sectors of society--actually, to all parts of government. _x000D_
Within the domain that we work in, which is public health and _x000D_
medical preparedness and response, I feel that we do have _x000D_
strong strategies, we do have strong collaborative mechanisms, _x000D_
and we have adequate structures in place to respond to the _x000D_
emergencies that we are presented with."
2926455,2926454,2926456,19242,4,    Dr. Redd.
2926456,2926455,2926457,19242,4,"    So, I think there is a policy process to make the _x000D_
kinds of changes that are being proposed--and that involves the _x000D_
legislature and the Executive Branch. And, this is a _x000D_
recommendation that needs to be looked at very carefully."
2926457,2926456,2926458,19242,4,    Mr. Shea.
2926458,2926457,2926459,19242,4,"    I certainly agree with them. I would say that so _x000D_
many great things are going on between our respective agencies _x000D_
and I think, if those could all be brought together, probably--_x000D_
certainly--it would be to our advantage."
2926459,2926458,2926460,19242,4,    OK. Dr. Firoved.
2926460,2926459,2926461,19242,4,"    Sure. I think that we are certainly taking to _x000D_
heart the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense's _x000D_
recommendations. We are trying to implement as many of them as _x000D_
we can. I think there are strong strategies. I think there are _x000D_
strong coordination mechanisms. We have touched on a few of _x000D_
them today, but there are many more. We are never going to be _x000D_
done. I think one of the things that strikes me is, after 9/11, _x000D_
when we were talking about interagency coordination to address _x000D_
it, so that we could connect the dots, there was one anecdotal _x000D_
story that someone stood up and said, ``I thought we were going _x000D_
to do this after Pearl Harbor.'' And so, this is a task that is _x000D_
never done. And, we will always have to strive and we are _x000D_
always going to have to grow and build these capabilities."
2926461,2926460,2926462,19242,4,"    Listen, I come from a manufacturing _x000D_
background. It just gets into your genes--continuous _x000D_
improvements. So, everything always can be improved._x000D_
    Mr. Currie, just a final comment. Again, the gentlemen here _x000D_
think there are certainly strategies--certainly areas for _x000D_
improvement. Is that a pretty accurate assessment from your _x000D_
standpoint?"
2926462,2926461,2926463,19242,4,"    Probably not surprising to hear we think _x000D_
strategy is important. And, I do not want to take away from _x000D_
some of the efforts that have been done. The public health _x000D_
strategy that Dr. Hatchett mentioned, I think, is probably the _x000D_
closest thing to such a comprehensive strategy. I think if I _x000D_
had to nail 1 key thing that is not being done that makes it _x000D_
difficult, it is this idea of being able to prioritize _x000D_
investments and prioritize efforts. Within each area, you can _x000D_
do that because the agencies and departments have control of _x000D_
those areas. But across, you cannot."
2926463,2926462,2926464,19242,4,"    Yes, so, at the agency level, you think _x000D_
you are doing a pretty good job of prioritizing, but, again, it _x000D_
is that top-down allocation of resources._x000D_
    Well, again, thank you all for your time, your testimony, _x000D_
and your answers to our questions. The hearing record will _x000D_
remain open for 15 days, until April 29 at 5 p.m., for the _x000D_
submission of statements and questions for the record._x000D_
    This hearing is adjourned."
2926464,2926463,2926465,19243,1,"    Good afternoon, everyone._x000D_
    I want to welcome everyone to today's Subcommittee hearing _x000D_
titled Examining Two GAO Reports Regarding the Renewable Fuel _x000D_
Standards (RFS). Thanks for being here._x000D_
    Today is this Subcommittee's second hearing on the _x000D_
Renewable Fuel Standard and my fourth hearing total on this _x000D_
topic since being elected to Congress, committed to continuing _x000D_
the oversight of the RFS until we find a solution to what has _x000D_
become this deeply flawed program._x000D_
    In 2005, Congress established the RFS with the goals of _x000D_
reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and lowering _x000D_
greenhouse gas emissions by mandating that biofuels be blended _x000D_
with domestic transportation fuel in increasing volumes until _x000D_
the year 2022. After that time, the Environmental Protection _x000D_
Agency (EPA) will have wide latitude to decide the volume of _x000D_
biofuels that must be blended into the gasoline supply._x000D_
    However, the situation has changed pretty dramatically _x000D_
since the RFS enactment in 2005, and in subsequent 2007 _x000D_
revision. Demand for oil in the transportation sector is lower _x000D_
than originally predicted, in part due to heightened fuel _x000D_
economy standards and sluggish economic growth. Further, given _x000D_
the substantially increased domestic oil production resulting _x000D_
from the shale oil boom, the United States also imports much _x000D_
less oil than initially forecasted. For instance, in 2005 and _x000D_
2007, we were importing 60 percent of our oil; now it is 27 _x000D_
percent._x000D_
    Through a series of hearings, I have worked to determine _x000D_
the structure and viability of the RFS to achieve its goals. _x000D_
Specifically, I have tried to understand the RFS through the _x000D_
eyes of the EPA and appreciate how difficult it is for the _x000D_
agency to administer the program. Congress created the _x000D_
unworkable RFS formula. The EPA is left trying to make it work _x000D_
anyway._x000D_
    The EPA is required to release the final volumes of _x000D_
biofuels to be blended with the gasoline supply by November 30 _x000D_
of the preceding year, to allow industry participants and other _x000D_
stakeholders to comply and plan for the future. Between 2009 _x000D_
and 2015, EPA failed to meet this November 30 deadline and only _x000D_
finally released final mandated volumes for 2014 through 2016, _x000D_
on November 30, 2015, one year late for the 2015 volumes and _x000D_
two years late for the 2014 final volumes._x000D_
    I would like to recognize the EPA has released its 2017 _x000D_
volumes on November 23, meeting the statutory deadline, in _x000D_
fact, beating it by all of seven days. You are making up _x000D_
ground._x000D_
    Recognizing the difficulties the EPA faces with the RFS, on _x000D_
April 6, 2015, I asked the Government Accountability Office _x000D_
(GAO) to examine the viability of the RFS and determine whether _x000D_
the program will be able to meet its goals in the future. It _x000D_
has taken GAO approximately 19 months to conduct a thorough, _x000D_
independent analysis of the RFS and finalize its conclusions. _x000D_
In order to reach its conclusions, GAO, in coordination with _x000D_
the National Academy of Sciences, convened a group of _x000D_
stakeholder experts from industry, academia, and the nonprofit _x000D_
sector to produce two reports on the RFS, both of which were _x000D_
released Monday, November 28, 2016._x000D_
    GAO's first report determined that advanced biofuel _x000D_
production is unlikely to meet the RFS's increasing production _x000D_
targets. GAO noted that advanced biofuels are still too _x000D_
expensive for stakeholders to produce it at necessary levels to _x000D_
meet the RFS increasing targets through 2022, even with _x000D_
government-funded research and development (R&D) and mandated _x000D_
subsidies._x000D_
    Despite the Federal Government spending of $1.1 billion _x000D_
between fiscal years (FY) 2013 and 2015, for advanced biofuel _x000D_
research and development, GAO determined that advanced biofuel _x000D_
targets are unattainable._x000D_
    In its second report, GAO concluded that the RFS is _x000D_
unlikely to meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. _x000D_
The production of advanced biofuels, which should reduce _x000D_
greenhouse gas emissions, will remain too limited to meet the _x000D_
program's greenhouse gas reduction targets. For example, in _x000D_
2015, cellulosic biofuel, an advanced biofuel category, was _x000D_
produced at a meager 140 million gallons, less than five _x000D_
percent of the statutory target of three billion gallons._x000D_
    This hearing will give GAO the opportunity to present its _x000D_
findings on the RFS from these two reports and the EPA to _x000D_
comment on the findings. With the release of the GAO reports, _x000D_
we have an independent government auditor's findings that _x000D_
confirm the stances many in Congress, including myself, have _x000D_
come to hold, that the RFS is not sustainable and will not meet _x000D_
its intended goals._x000D_
    This program yields few benefits but it inflicts _x000D_
substantial cost on consumers. Rather than continuing with an _x000D_
unwieldy program which consistently fails to meets its targets _x000D_
and goals, it is time for Congress, the next administration, _x000D_
and the American public to do away with the RFS._x000D_
    Here is my comparison. Last year, Congress looked again at _x000D_
education. Fifteen years ago, we created No Child Left Behind, _x000D_
in a very eager effort to do what is best for our kids in the _x000D_
future. There was a whole series of mandates that were put in _x000D_
place with No Child Left Behind. Fifteen years later, Congress _x000D_
looked at it again and said those mandates were the wrong way _x000D_
to go, and we fixed it. We came back in wide bipartisan _x000D_
majorities, after extensive research and examination, and said _x000D_
it is time that we do away with these mandates and do education _x000D_
a different way. It is not that we do not like education; we _x000D_
do. We just went a wrong direction with No Child Left Behind _x000D_
and we fixed it._x000D_
    It is not that any of us are opposed to ethanol. It is a _x000D_
good fuel source. It is a good octane booster. It is in the _x000D_
fuel supply right now. It is not that I meet anyone that is _x000D_
opposed to ethanol. It is the series of mandates that were put _x000D_
in place and volume requirements that are not sustainable._x000D_
    I am delighted to have the EPA's Janet McCabe and GAO's _x000D_
Frank Rusco here today as witnesses to engage in a productive _x000D_
conversation on the RFS._x000D_
    I look forward to continuing this Subcommittee's oversight _x000D_
of the RFS with my colleagues and our witnesses today._x000D_
    I will recognize the Ranking Member, Heidi Heitkamp, for _x000D_
her opening statement when she arrives. She is running a little _x000D_
bit behind, but as we always say, the lady is never late. So _x000D_
when she gets here I will allow her to be able to do her _x000D_
opening statements._x000D_
    With that, let me swear in our witnesses._x000D_
    If you would please stand._x000D_
    Do you swear the testimony that you are about to give _x000D_
before this Subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, _x000D_
and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?"
2926465,2926464,2926466,19243,1,    I do.
2926466,2926465,2926467,19243,1,    I do.
2926467,2926466,2926468,19243,1,"    Thank you. Let the record reflect the _x000D_
witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated._x000D_
    Let me do a quick introduction for both of you, and then _x000D_
when Senator Heitkamp arrives, even if it is after your _x000D_
testimony, I am going to have her do an opening statement as _x000D_
well._x000D_
    Frank Rusco is the Director of the Government _x000D_
Accountability Office's Natural Resources and Environment team, _x000D_
leading work on a broad spectrum of energy issues. Mr. Rusco _x000D_
holds both a master's degree and a Ph.D. in economics from the _x000D_
University of Washington in Seattle._x000D_
    Janet McCabe is the Acting Assistant Administrator for the _x000D_
Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation _x000D_
(OAR), having previously served in the OAR's Principal Deputy _x000D_
to the Assistant Administrator. Ms. McCabe was also the _x000D_
Executive Director of Improving Kids' Environment, Inc., in _x000D_
Indianapolis, Indiana, and from 1993 to 2005, held leadership _x000D_
positions in the Indiana Department of Environmental _x000D_
Management's Office of Air Quality. Ms. McCabe served as _x000D_
Assistant Attorney General for environmental protection in _x000D_
Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard College in 1980 and _x000D_
Harvard Law School in 1983._x000D_
    Thank you, both, for being here as well, and with that I _x000D_
would recognize the Ranking Member for opening statements."
2926468,2926467,2926469,19243,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again my _x000D_
great apologies for being a little late. It has been a crazy _x000D_
day._x000D_
    First off, I want to thank both of our witnesses for _x000D_
attending this hearing. This actually follows on our hearing _x000D_
last June on the RFS. In that hearing, we discussed, at length, _x000D_
issues we saw with the EPA's management of the program and the _x000D_
statute, and I am glad EPA took our words to heart, and that _x000D_
just last week the RFS is back on track and hit the levels _x000D_
required by law for calendar year 2017, for most fuels, and _x000D_
they even increased the volumes for biofuels and advanced _x000D_
biofuels. So thank you, Ms. McCabe, for your good work on that. _x000D_
We were grateful. Wish it would have come a little earlier, but _x000D_
we will take it when we can get it._x000D_
    Of course, EPA did not meet the statutory levels for some _x000D_
advanced biofuels, allegedly because of the lack of production, _x000D_
and we want to hear more about that, and that really is what _x000D_
generated this discussion today._x000D_
    Senator Ernst and I noted last June that such delays in _x000D_
setting up the program and in setting annual volume obligations _x000D_
really did lead to stalled investments in advanced biofuels, _x000D_
and so had we had more certainty in the marketplace we could _x000D_
have actually, I think, seen the kind of investment that it _x000D_
would have taken to get that product into the market._x000D_
    So the reports that we are reviewing today do not _x000D_
necessarily come as a surprise. GAO found that we will not meet _x000D_
some of the statutory targets for advanced biofuels or _x000D_
greenhouse gas reductions, two measures which, arguably and do, _x000D_
go hand in hand. Again, this is not a surprise or even new, as _x000D_
we acknowledged at last year's hearing. It was part of the _x000D_
disruption that we saw in the marketplace as a result of _x000D_
uncertainty from earlier decisions._x000D_
    Fortunately, the authors of the RFS made contingency plans _x000D_
if EPA ever found the industry was not ready to meet these _x000D_
targets, and the law allows EPA to reduce those annual _x000D_
obligations. This is why having annual rule-setting is helpful, _x000D_
though it also brings a level of uncertainty. We can adjust _x000D_
course when it is absolutely necessary. The authors put in _x000D_
place authorities for EPA to rewrite the statutory levels _x000D_
through the reset authority, and I look forward to discussing _x000D_
that here today with both of our witnesses._x000D_
    So I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and _x000D_
discussing how we can work together with the industry and the _x000D_
administration, and we certainly note that President-Elect _x000D_
Trump supports the RFS, and we all know how important that is _x000D_
to markets and to certainty for our farmers._x000D_
    So we are grateful that you are both here. This is will be _x000D_
an ongoing and continuing subject of discussion. But if you are _x000D_
going to be for all of the above, this is a key component to an _x000D_
energy policy that helps us diversify our energy sources, _x000D_
moving into the future. Congress was wise when they first _x000D_
enacted it, providing these incentives. I want to see that _x000D_
these incentives work._x000D_
    And so thank you, Ms. McCabe, thank you, Mr. Rusco, for _x000D_
being here. I look forward to your testimony._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2926469,2926468,2926470,19243,1,"    Thank you as well._x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF FRANK RUSCO,\1\ DIRECTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES AND _x000D_
       ENVIRONMENT, U."
2926470,2926469,2926471,19243,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp, and Members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to be _x000D_
here today to discuss GAO's two Reports on the Renewable Fuel _x000D_
Standard program._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Rusco appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 27._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    In response to a request from Chairman Lankford, we _x000D_
undertook two studies on the RFS. One study reported on Federal _x000D_
efforts to support R&D for advanced biofuels and the current _x000D_
state of technology as well as prospects for meeting the RFS _x000D_
statutory targets for advanced biofuels production. The second _x000D_
study reported on EPA's administration of the program and how _x000D_
that administration could be improved as well as the prospects _x000D_
for meeting the RFS goals for reducing greenhouse gas _x000D_
emissions, among other things._x000D_
    To do these studies, we entered into a contract with the _x000D_
National Academy of Sciences to identify a broad and _x000D_
comprehensive group of experts who could assist us in answering _x000D_
our questions. Last spring, we held a group meeting at the _x000D_
Academy with 20 of these experts and explored the state of _x000D_
technology and prospects for meeting production targets for _x000D_
advanced biofuels. We also met individually with 24 experts _x000D_
identified by the Academy, to evaluate EPA's administration of _x000D_
the program. In addition, we spoke with officials from the _x000D_
Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (USDA), _x000D_
EPA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department _x000D_
of Defense (DOD). We also visited research laboratories in _x000D_
Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and interviewed representatives _x000D_
of 11 advanced biofuels producers that use a wide variety of _x000D_
feed stocks and conversion technologies. Finally, we reviewed _x000D_
numerous studies and reports pertinent to our questions._x000D_
    The most salient finding of our reports is that it is _x000D_
unlikely that advanced biofuels can meet statutory targets for _x000D_
the RFS in the near to mid term. Specifically, production of _x000D_
advanced biofuels fell below statutory targets by well over one _x000D_
billion gallons in 2014, and is expected to be almost five _x000D_
billion gallons short by 2017. While there is some room for _x000D_
growth of advanced biofuels, particularly for the fuels that _x000D_
have already been commercialized, we found broad expert _x000D_
consensus that this growth potential in the near to mid term _x000D_
falls far short of RFS statutory targets._x000D_
    The second major finding is that changes to law or EPA's _x000D_
administration could marginally improve the program and the _x000D_
investment climate for advanced biofuels. For example, experts _x000D_
said that changing obligated parties to blenders as opposed to _x000D_
oil refiners would improve the functioning of the Renewable _x000D_
Identification Number (RIN) market, reduce RIN fraud, and _x000D_
eliminate an asymmetric burden on small, independent refiners _x000D_
who are not also blenders of biofuels. In addition, providing _x000D_
Federal tax credits that do not expire periodically would _x000D_
reduce uncertainty._x000D_
    However, there remained significant barriers to adding more _x000D_
biofuels to the transportation fuel network. These include the _x000D_
need to install costly infrastructure at retail stations, to _x000D_
educate consumers about how to value different blends of _x000D_
biofuels, and addressing the risk that increased advanced _x000D_
biofuels use, if mandated, will lead to higher consumer fuel _x000D_
prices. These barriers, if not overcome, will constrain growth _x000D_
in biofuel use and also dampen investors' appetite for risk._x000D_
    The third major finding is that because advanced biofuels _x000D_
production targets are unlikely to be met, so too are the goals _x000D_
set out for the RFS, including greenhouse gas reductions. _x000D_
Specifically, experts questioned the extent to which the RFS is _x000D_
achieving its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, _x000D_
considering that most of the biofuels produced today come from _x000D_
cornstarch conversion technologies which do not yield large _x000D_
reductions in greenhouse gases._x000D_
    With regard to reducing reliance on imported fuels, the _x000D_
United States has made great progress in recent years in _x000D_
reducing net imports of petroleum, in large part because _x000D_
domestic oil production has increased dramatically. Domestic _x000D_
biofuel production, net of imported biofuels, have also helped, _x000D_
but to a much smaller degree, and further progress would _x000D_
require breakthroughs in development of cost-competitive _x000D_
advanced biofuels._x000D_
    Last, experts generally agreed that meeting goals of the _x000D_
RFS could be done more efficiently using other policies. In _x000D_
particular, a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) _x000D_
would more directly incentivize greenhouse gas reductions than _x000D_
does the RFS, and would do so at lower cost._x000D_
    GAO does not make any recommendations in these two reports _x000D_
because we feel there is no consensus among experts on how best _x000D_
to proceed with the policy, in general._x000D_
    This ends my prepared statement. I will be happy to answer _x000D_
any questions you may have."

2926472,2926471,2926473,19243,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp, and other Members of the Subcommittee. I also _x000D_
appreciate the opportunity to be here and testify on the _x000D_
Renewable Fuel Standard program and on EPA's recent final rule, _x000D_
setting the annual volume standards for 2017 and the biomass-_x000D_
based diesel volume requirement for 2018._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. McCabe appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 41._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The RFS program began in 2006, under the Energy Policy Act _x000D_
of 2005, and was subsequently modified by the Energy _x000D_
Independence and Security Act of 2007. That law's stated goals _x000D_
include moving the United States toward greater energy _x000D_
independence and security and increasing production of clean _x000D_
renewable fuels. The law established new annual volume targets _x000D_
for renewable fuel that increase every year, to reach a total _x000D_
of 36 billion gallons by 2022, including 21 billion gallons of _x000D_
advanced biofuels. Congress also included tools, known as _x000D_
waiver provisions, for EPA to use to adjust the statutory _x000D_
targets in specified circumstances, including where the _x000D_
statutorily prescribed volumes could not be met._x000D_
    The Clean Air Act requires EPA to issue annual standards _x000D_
for four different categories of renewable fuels: total, _x000D_
advanced, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic. These standards _x000D_
designate the percentage of each biofuel category that _x000D_
producers and importers of gasoline and diesel must blend into _x000D_
transportation fuel, and must be issued by November 30 of each _x000D_
year for the following year, and 14 months in advance for _x000D_
biomass-based diesel category._x000D_
    EPA is committed to successful implementation of the RFS _x000D_
program, and the past year has been an active and productive _x000D_
one for the program._x000D_
    One of our chief priorities, if not the chief priority, has _x000D_
been timely issuance of the annual volume rules, and we have _x000D_
stayed on schedule for the 2017 rule, as the Chairman _x000D_
acknowledged, and we just finalized that last week. The final _x000D_
rule incorporates the most up-to-date data available to us, and _x000D_
is informed by written stakeholder comments, by input provided _x000D_
during a public hearing we held this year in Kansas City, _x000D_
Missouri, and by our consultation with the Departments of _x000D_
Energy and Agriculture._x000D_
    The 2017 volume final rule established requirements for _x000D_
cellulosic, advanced, and total renewable fuel for 2017, and _x000D_
includes a biomass-based diesel volume requirement for 2018. _x000D_
The 2017 final rule once again establishes ambitious but _x000D_
achievable targets for the RFS program, and becomes part of _x000D_
what is not a multi-year track record of growth. As finalized, _x000D_
total renewable fuel volumes would grow by nearly 1.2 billion _x000D_
gallons between 2016 and 2017. Advanced renewable fuel, which _x000D_
requires a minimum 50 percent lifecycle greenhouse gas _x000D_
emissions reductions, would grow by nearly 700 million gallons _x000D_
from 2016 to 2017. And while Congress did not establish _x000D_
specific goals for non-advanced or conventional biofuels, the _x000D_
established targets for total and advanced fuel means that _x000D_
conventional biofuels would read 15 billion gallons. The 2017 _x000D_
final rule achieves that level._x000D_
    Biomass-based diesel, which must achieve at least 50 _x000D_
percent lifecycle emissions reductions, would grow by at least _x000D_
100 million gallons from 2017 to 2018, and the final 2018 _x000D_
standard is more than double the congressionally mandated _x000D_
minimum level of one billion gallons. Finally, cellulosic _x000D_
biofuels, which requires 60 percent lifecycle carbon emissions _x000D_
reductions, would grow by 81 million gallons, or 35 percent, _x000D_
between 2016 and 2017._x000D_
    Beyond the volume rule, the Agency remains active in _x000D_
multiple other areas of the program, and I would like to _x000D_
briefly mention two. On November 16, we published the _x000D_
``Renewables Enhancement and Growth Support'' (REGS) proposed _x000D_
rule, a collection of proposed revisions to the fuel _x000D_
regulations that will support market growth of advanced and _x000D_
other biofuels in the United States. That proposal, among other _x000D_
things, would establish an updated regulatory structure that _x000D_
would allow biofuel producers to partially process renewable _x000D_
feedstocks at one facility and further process them into _x000D_
renewable fuels at another facility under existing pathways. _x000D_
This would improve the economics and efficiency for the _x000D_
production of biofuels, particularly advanced and cellulosic _x000D_
fuels. The proposal strongly reflects input we have received _x000D_
from many stakeholders in recent years, and we are looking _x000D_
forward to people's comments in January._x000D_
    The second thing to mention is that over the past year, EPA _x000D_
has received several petitions from RFS stakeholders asking us _x000D_
to change the point of obligation under the program. That has _x000D_
already been mentioned. Currently, refiners and importers of _x000D_
gasoline and diesel are the regulated parties under the RFS _x000D_
program, and certain stakeholders have asked us to initiate a _x000D_
rulemaking to change that point of regulation to a point _x000D_
further downstream, such as blenders. There has been a huge _x000D_
amount of input from a wide range of stakeholders with widely _x000D_
divergent views, and on November 10 of this year we issued a _x000D_
proposed denial of these positions that examines the issue in _x000D_
depth and, importantly, provides an opportunity for the public _x000D_
to provide comment to the Agency, which was a strong request as _x000D_
well. So we are, again, looking forward to people's input on _x000D_
that._x000D_
    And just recently, the GAO issued these two reports. We _x000D_
provided responses to drafts of both reports and appreciate _x000D_
that opportunity, and those comments are included as part of _x000D_
the final report. Broadly speaking, the reports examine the _x000D_
same challenges that we have recognized and that we have talked _x000D_
about before, associated with reaching greater levels of _x000D_
advanced biofuel production, especially cellulosic fuels, and _x000D_
we welcome the discussion in the reports and certainly the _x000D_
discussion today._x000D_
    So we recognize that there are opportunities and challenges _x000D_
ahead. We are committed to implementing Congress's statute the _x000D_
best way we can, to achieve Congress's goal, and look forward _x000D_
to the conversation today and appreciate the opportunity to be _x000D_
here."
2926473,2926472,2926474,19243,1,"    All right. Thank you._x000D_
    The Ranking Member and I are deferring our questions to the _x000D_
end._x000D_
    We recognize Senator Ernst."
2926474,2926473,2926475,19243,1,"    Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you _x000D_
to both of you for appearing today._x000D_
    This is an interesting topic for a number of us, and _x000D_
especially for me, coming from the Midwest, where this is a _x000D_
great part of our economy. So, again, I always appreciate the _x000D_
opportunity that we have to discuss the RFS, and it really has _x000D_
spurred investment in domestic energy production. It has helped _x000D_
grow our economy throughout the Midwest, especially in those _x000D_
rural areas. And it has brought a lot of competition, needed _x000D_
competition, to the gas pump, saves American consumers money, _x000D_
and reduces reliance on foreign oil sources._x000D_
    So while some of the aggressive production targets for _x000D_
advanced biofuels originally envisioned by Congress have not _x000D_
been achieved--and I think we all recognize that--it is _x000D_
certainly not time to hit the panic button and pull the rug out _x000D_
from under this burgeoning industry. We are really just getting _x000D_
started, is how I feel about this._x000D_
    And so, Mr. Rusco, one of the reports that GAO had, states _x000D_
that bolt-on cellulosic technology at existing plants is the _x000D_
most cost-effective means for generating those advanced _x000D_
biofuels, and I did visit one of those facilities, one of the _x000D_
bolt-on facilities, in Galva, Iowa, earlier this year, and they _x000D_
are using corn fiber, which is a byproduct of the ethanol _x000D_
process, to create cellulosic ethanol. And this is a great _x000D_
example of what this was originally intended to do. It was to _x000D_
support the expansion of conventional biofuels as a springboard _x000D_
for those advanced biofuels. And if we create further _x000D_
uncertainty about the future of the RFS and our commitment to _x000D_
biofuels, it will only serve to slow our research and _x000D_
investment down toward attaining these goals originally set by _x000D_
Congress._x000D_
    So my question to you would be, what are the most effective _x000D_
things that we can do, as a Federal Government, to provide _x000D_
certainty so that these companies want to invest in the _x000D_
advanced biofuel production process? What can we do to provide _x000D_
certainty?"
2926475,2926474,2926476,19243,1,"    So we did hear from a number of people that--_x000D_
certainly, certainty about the availability of Federal tax _x000D_
credits, the $1 per gallon tax credits. We also heard from a _x000D_
lot of the producers that they really relied on Federal funding _x000D_
for R&D because there really is not available investment _x000D_
funding from the private sector that is sufficient to do a lot _x000D_
of the research that they need. But we also heard that even _x000D_
with those changes, they are many years away from bringing even _x000D_
the technologies that they understand very well, like _x000D_
cellulosic ethanol, and for which there are currently a couple _x000D_
of commercial plants, they are many years away from bringing _x000D_
costs down to where they would be competitive in a market _x000D_
sense."
2926476,2926475,2926477,19243,1,"    OK. Thank you._x000D_
    And Ms. McCabe, I want to first applaud, just as the Vice _x000D_
Chair did, for the EPA getting RFS back on track last week. We _x000D_
appreciate that, and the issuance of the final 2017 Renewable _x000D_
Volume Obligation (RVOs). And can you highlight the factors _x000D_
that led to the Agency increasing the blending targets from the _x000D_
proposed levels to the final rule?"
2926477,2926476,2926478,19243,1,"    Yes. So the major factor that we look at, and _x000D_
we update it throughout the year, is expected gasoline usage, _x000D_
and so there were--we rely on Energy Information Administration _x000D_
(EIA) for their estimates of that. And so it was predicted that _x000D_
there would be additional gasoline usage in 2017, which allowed _x000D_
us to grow those volumes. And we just continually update our _x000D_
expectations about the ability of the industry to produce _x000D_
volumes, and so when we put all that together, that is the way _x000D_
the numbers fell out, that we were able to increase those _x000D_
volumes."
2926478,2926477,2926479,19243,1,"    OK. Very good. Well, I appreciate that very _x000D_
much._x000D_
    We do have some challenges in the industry, but again, I _x000D_
think providing certainty, going back, is an important part of _x000D_
ensuring that we can stay on target with the production of _x000D_
ethanol and biofuels, advanced biofuels. And we have seen other _x000D_
concessions made within the Federal Government, other tax _x000D_
credits for other petroleum-based products. We see it with _x000D_
fracking. I do not see why we should not continue with research _x000D_
and development in this area, especially when it has done a _x000D_
great deal to support the economy, especially when we have _x000D_
downturns in the agricultural economy, like we have seen in the _x000D_
last number of years._x000D_
    So I encourage you to continue supporting the RFS. Let us _x000D_
look at ways we can further research and development in this _x000D_
industry. I think it is a valuable part of our American _x000D_
economy._x000D_
    But I want to thank you both for being here today and _x000D_
answering our questions. Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chair."
2926479,2926478,2926480,19243,1,    All right. Senator Heitkamp.
2926480,2926479,2926481,19243,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I begin _x000D_
my questions, I just want to ask that the letter that I am _x000D_
going to hand to you is, in fact, introduced into the _x000D_
record.\1\ It is signed by a number of groups who frequently _x000D_
you will not find their names on the same letter. They are _x000D_
suggesting and expressing their unified position in opposition _x000D_
of efforts by petitioners to move the point of obligation on _x000D_
compliance. You have API and the RFA on the same letter. That _x000D_
is pretty remarkable._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The letter submitted by Senator Heitkamp appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 45._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926481,2926480,2926482,19243,1,"    Without objection._x000D_
volumes in terms of answering the petition, and obviously we _x000D_
hope that you give full consideration, but these interest _x000D_
groups have been long involved in this, and for them to share a _x000D_
common opinion might put a little more weight on what they are _x000D_
doing, or what they are suggesting._x000D_
    So I think we are all trying to get a handle on how we do _x000D_
not have this happen again, where the market is unresponsive, _x000D_
or is in a position of uncertainty given the lack of certainty _x000D_
on where we are headed, in terms of numbers. And so in order to _x000D_
prevent that from happening again, I think we have to better _x000D_
understand why the market did not respond and come to numbers _x000D_
that were adequate to meet the quotas or meet the levels._x000D_
    So I guess my first question would be for you, Mr. Rusco. _x000D_
In your opinion, what was the most significant contributor to _x000D_
the delay in advanced biofuels production? Was it delays in _x000D_
setting up the RFS program, initially, uncertainty related to _x000D_
the RVOs' timing from the litigation and flawed--what I believe _x000D_
was flawed--reading of the statutory waivers, or was it really _x000D_
more about tax uncertainty, or was it something all together? _x000D_
And in your opinion, in the work that you did, do you believe _x000D_
that had we had maintained a level of statutory certainty, or _x000D_
certainty in meeting those statutory requirements, we would _x000D_
have seen the level of investment that would have been able to _x000D_
meet the standards?"
2926482,2926481,2926483,19243,1,"    I think that it is pretty clear from most of the _x000D_
people that we spoke with, including producers of advanced _x000D_
biofuels and researchers in that area, that, sort of, the _x000D_
biggest issue is the price of oil. So if the price of oil is _x000D_
very high, then there is going to be more investment in _x000D_
alternatives to that, and when the price was high a number of _x000D_
years ago, even some oil companies were diversifying and _x000D_
investing in biofuel technology. But when the bottom fell out _x000D_
of the market for oil, and also with reductions and slower _x000D_
growth since then of motor fuel demand in the United States, _x000D_
investors just looked at biofuels as not as viable an _x000D_
investment as other things, so money flowed elsewhere._x000D_
    I do think that in the margin, things like--regulatory _x000D_
uncertainty and uncertainty about tax credits, do play a role, _x000D_
but what we have found is that, for example, cellulosic _x000D_
ethanol, which is probably the most likely advanced biofuel to _x000D_
be technologically and commercially ready in the near to mid _x000D_
term, it will require multiple generations of plants to achieve _x000D_
the kinds of efficiencies that might bring it down to where it _x000D_
is commercially viable. But that also, then, depends on, again, _x000D_
on the underlying price of motor fuels. And so that, I think, _x000D_
is the biggest."
2926483,2926482,2926484,19243,1,"    I mean, I understand what you are saying, _x000D_
that a lower-price competitor can drive investment someplace _x000D_
else and cause people a lot of concern, but so can regulatory _x000D_
uncertainty. And I think when we look at advanced--not to put a _x000D_
fine point on it, but this is a building block industry, as you _x000D_
look at other potential available growth in advanced _x000D_
manufacturing for ag products. I used to say, well, we want to _x000D_
move beyond food, fiber, and fuel, and the pushback I always _x000D_
got is that this technology that can be developed, and the _x000D_
plants that can be developed, really provide the building block _x000D_
for other opportunities, whether it is Styrofoam or whether it _x000D_
is seat covers or all of that begins at this level of _x000D_
innovation._x000D_
    And so I think there is, beyond an all-of-the-above energy _x000D_
policy that really works for the United States and gives us the _x000D_
diversity in our fuel choices, we have to realize that this is _x000D_
also technology that is very transferrable to other kinds of _x000D_
renewable manufacturing, and it is critical, as we look into _x000D_
the future, of how we utilize natural resources, especially the _x000D_
natural resource of the soils and the stuff that we grow in our _x000D_
country. So we are hopeful that we will have consistency now _x000D_
going forward which will lead to predictability._x000D_
    But I want to get to the reset authority. I only have so _x000D_
much time and I think it is important that we remember that the _x000D_
reset authority, when we have this discussion around reports _x000D_
and not meeting advanced fuel mandates, just because, for a _x000D_
variety of reasons, we do not meet the targets does not mean _x000D_
the law is either a failure or needs amendment._x000D_
    We have a process in place to, I think, correct, if _x000D_
necessary. I think, Ms. McCabe, the 2007 law that Congress _x000D_
passed included the reset provision to allow EPA to adjust the _x000D_
RFS mandates after 2016, if the volume totals in the table had _x000D_
gone below the law by 20 percent in two consecutive years, or _x000D_
by 50 percent in one year. Has this authority been triggered _x000D_
for any of the tables in the law today, and since the _x000D_
authority--I guess I would just like you to explain where you _x000D_
see the reset authority today and the likelihood of reset, and _x000D_
if--what role this disruption played in getting to the reset _x000D_
authority."
2926484,2926483,2926485,19243,1,"    So just to explain what Congress laid out, you _x000D_
have it exactly right--20 percent in two years or 50 percent in _x000D_
one year. So those levels have been triggered for cellulosic _x000D_
and for advanced, but not for total. And so the Agency has _x000D_
not--and we have just finished--we are just finishing 2016--the _x000D_
Agency has not embarked upon a reset rule. We, of course, are _x000D_
paying close attention to it. A couple of things are going on _x000D_
that cause us to think really hard about how to proceed with _x000D_
that. One is the idea of moving forward with one or two, but _x000D_
not all of the volume standards, seems like it could be very _x000D_
disruptive to the market because of the careful balance that _x000D_
Congress established with the relationship of those nested _x000D_
standards. We also still have some ongoing uncertainty because _x000D_
of pending litigation about our authorities with respect to the _x000D_
waiver, in particular, but other things as well._x000D_
    So we have not hit even the first-year trigger for total, _x000D_
so it would be at least two more years before that--all three _x000D_
would be triggered, and that is kind of where we are with the _x000D_
reset."
2926485,2926484,2926486,19243,1,"    Yes, and we do not want a self-fulfilling _x000D_
prophecy, which is the reset happens because we have reset._x000D_
    So, Mr. Rusco, was this reset discussed by your panelists, _x000D_
and would the reset not make the report on not meeting _x000D_
increasing targets moot since the law already addresses this?"
2926486,2926485,2926487,19243,1,"    It did come up but our report just is focused on _x000D_
what is likely to be available in terms of how much volumes _x000D_
will be available, not necessarily whether or not the industry _x000D_
will be in compliance."
2926487,2926486,2926488,19243,1,"    We keep talking in circles, because one _x000D_
of the problems that we have, and that we have had from the _x000D_
beginning, is what is available depends on regulatory _x000D_
certainty, and I recognize the marketplace, and we were a big _x000D_
producer of oil so we understand what is happening with oil. _x000D_
But, the frustration for me is that we say, well, ``What is _x000D_
available? What is available?'' What is available is going to _x000D_
depend on what there is capital investment for and whether _x000D_
there is capital investment and innovation is going to depend _x000D_
on regulatory certainty._x000D_
    So we are in this kind of spiral that deeply concerns me, _x000D_
and I am wondering, when you discussed the reset, was this, _x000D_
the, well, what if we had not had regulatory uncertainty, what _x000D_
if these targets had remained available, we would then have the _x000D_
ability to amp up and meet the requirements under the law or _x000D_
the targets under the law?"
2926488,2926487,2926489,19243,1,"    So I do not think that we heard a lot of people _x000D_
say that if EPA had maintained the statutory targets that they _x000D_
would have been met. I do not think anybody said that. What _x000D_
they did say is that, going forward, reducing regulatory _x000D_
uncertainty improves marginally the investment climate. But I _x000D_
think that they also did not say that that would sort of fix _x000D_
the problem and that there would be adequate investment to get _x000D_
there."
2926489,2926488,2926490,19243,1,"    Where they would have been likely to say _x000D_
a $100 a barrel will fix the investment problem. They were not _x000D_
willing to say, $40 to $50 a barrel with regulatory uncertainty _x000D_
was not causation for the problem?"
2926490,2926489,2926491,19243,1,"    Well, in the report where we talked about R&D _x000D_
and the sort of state of science, they are just well up the _x000D_
curve on commercialization and bringing costs down. They are _x000D_
far above the market rate. They are many years from that under _x000D_
the most optimistic scenarios. So even if you threw money at _x000D_
it, a lot of money at it, which right now there is not a lot of _x000D_
money being thrown at this, you would be many generations of _x000D_
plants, even for the already sort of commercial scale _x000D_
operations, you are many generations away from achieving the _x000D_
efficiencies that are available, and the current cost at which _x000D_
they can produce is so high that you would need many _x000D_
generations in order to bring those costs down, if it is _x000D_
possible at all. And so----"
2926491,2926490,2926492,19243,1,"    So the discussion really went to _x000D_
technological impossibility, at this point in time."
2926492,2926491,2926493,19243,1,"    Not impossibility, but that it is just far away _x000D_
from--the cost, currently, given the state of technology, is _x000D_
very much higher than a market competitive price of motor _x000D_
fuels."
2926493,2926492,2926494,19243,1,"    Well, I think we are going to have an _x000D_
ongoing discussion, given that we have reached the trigger on _x000D_
the reset, and I know the Chairman has been discussing this _x000D_
quite a bit, and we need to live in reality. I get that. But we _x000D_
also need to understand that this was designed to create an _x000D_
environment, a regulatory environment, and a regulatory _x000D_
certainty that would grow investment and grow technology. And I _x000D_
think we have missed a couple of years here because of the _x000D_
uncertainty that has been in the market._x000D_
    So with that I will yield to the Chairman."
2926494,2926493,2926495,19243,1,"    Let me pose a few questions and then I _x000D_
would like to just open this up, as we typically do in our _x000D_
committee, to more open conversation from there._x000D_
    Ms. McCabe, the statute itself, the way that it was _x000D_
designed in 2007, had a high volume for corn-based ethanol at _x000D_
the beginning and then a decreasing amount. If I remember _x000D_
correctly, the number was around 44 percent by the time we get _x000D_
to the end of the window. That is the other part of the statute _x000D_
that is the battle for you, because while you are trying to _x000D_
follow a statute that was written in an unworkable way, and _x000D_
this put you in an untenable situation to be in waiver-land, to _x000D_
constantly have to work with every side of an argument to try _x000D_
to figure out how to be able to match this when there is _x000D_
really--the statute itself does not work with the gallons _x000D_
requirement, based on the gallons that we are using--so you are _x000D_
having to work through this process._x000D_
    How are you balancing this issue of the statute requires we _x000D_
use much less corn ethanol and much more cellulosic and _x000D_
advanced, when the technology does not exist yet for large-_x000D_
scale production of the advanced and for cellulosic? So, _x000D_
literally, for you to be able to keep a total amount and not do _x000D_
a reset of total amount, you are having to violate a different _x000D_
part of the statute, which requires we use less of this one. _x000D_
How does that conversation go for you all?"
2926495,2926494,2926496,19243,1,"    Well, that is exactly the point I was making a _x000D_
minute ago about our concern about moving forward with reset on _x000D_
two of the categories and not the third, because of that _x000D_
balance. The goals of the statute, as I understand it, Senator, _x000D_
are really to focus, in the long term, on advanced biofuels, _x000D_
and in particular on cellulosic biofuels that provide the most _x000D_
opportunity for greenhouse gas reductions. And as has been _x000D_
discussed already here, that is an industry that is just _x000D_
starting, as compared to the petroleum institute--industry, or _x000D_
the ethanol industry, where those technologies have been around _x000D_
for quite a long time._x000D_
    So I think it was a tall order, and this is what Congress _x000D_
does, in establishing the aspirational legislation to move _x000D_
things in a certain direction--I do not mean aspirational in _x000D_
the sense that we are not supposed to do it, but it was a _x000D_
vision, and an ambitious one._x000D_
    So our focus, and the Administrator's focus, all along, in _x000D_
every rule, has been we need to be providing as much _x000D_
encouragement as possible to advanced biofuels, to cellulosic _x000D_
biofuels, as we can, and because we are just at the point now, _x000D_
with this rule, where we have gotten to that maximum _x000D_
conventional amount, we are now moving to the area where _x000D_
hopefully those volumes will continue to grow, continue to _x000D_
grow, and move toward that ultimate proportion that you _x000D_
mentioned."
2926496,2926495,2926497,19243,1,"    Some of this has been a redefinition of _x000D_
what is included in cellulosic and what is included in advanced _x000D_
fuels, as you have expanded more the biogas and some of those _x000D_
things. So give me a percentage for the advanced fuels, of what _x000D_
is--what was defined as an advanced fuel, let us say, four or _x000D_
five years ago, and then some of the changes that have been _x000D_
made to be able to add in some of the other types of fuels."
2926497,2926496,2926498,19243,1,"    Well, it is not quite a redefinition because _x000D_
the statute says in order to count as cellulosic you have to _x000D_
get a 60 percent reduction, and advanced, a 50 percent _x000D_
reduction. So there are processes in the rule which we are _x000D_
implementing as expeditiously as we can to identify and _x000D_
approve, when people come to us with pathways. And so for each _x000D_
one of those we look at what the applicant comes to us with, _x000D_
and what does this mean in terms of the reduction, and does it _x000D_
qualify as a cellulosic fuel or does it qualify?_x000D_
    So things that have been approved recently, one of the most _x000D_
promising is biogas, which qualifies as a cellulosic fuel and _x000D_
has allowed us to increase volumes of cellulosic quite _x000D_
significantly, and we continue to look for those technologies, _x000D_
and as they fit into different categories we will put them in _x000D_
the right category."
2926498,2926497,2926499,19243,1,"    In that particular area, and it is _x000D_
promising on the biogas to be able to see that, the feedstock _x000D_
for that and the ability, that has been some of the challenge _x000D_
with biodiesel, is that it has been very productive, it has _x000D_
exceeded its targets on it, but the amount that we actually _x000D_
produce of feedstock is the problem for that. You have to be _x000D_
able to literally kill more hogs or find more way to get grease _x000D_
or something else to be able to go after that, to be able to _x000D_
get more of it._x000D_
    Are we going to have the same issue with the biogas as _x000D_
well? Is there a cap in the amount of feedstock that is out _x000D_
there?"
2926499,2926498,2926500,19243,1,"    I do not know the answer to that. I would be _x000D_
happy to find out. I mean, certainly with any of these _x000D_
feedstocks, that is a part of the analysis, is how much is _x000D_
available--how much more can and should be encouraged and is _x000D_
cost-efficient to encourage, and that is where the market comes _x000D_
into play in a significant way, and people continue to innovate _x000D_
also."
2926500,2926499,2926501,19243,1,"    And the innovation we want to be able to _x000D_
maintain. Obviously that is part of where we are. We always _x000D_
want to be able to innovate in energy."
2926501,2926500,2926502,19243,1,    Right.
2926502,2926501,2926503,19243,1,"    Mr. Rusco, as I go through the two _x000D_
reports, the key takeaways that I get from the two reports, one _x000D_
is, based on where we are, what is happening, the production _x000D_
levels, we are not seeing a reduction in greenhouse gases and _x000D_
we will not see that in the foreseeable future unless there is _x000D_
a very significant change in the advanced fuel and cellulosic. _x000D_
Is that correct?"
2926503,2926502,2926504,19243,1,"    The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is _x000D_
uncertain in terms of conventional biofuels, in large part _x000D_
because most of the conventional biofuel production was already _x000D_
in place before the requirement to have a 20 percent reduction. _x000D_
So we do not know how much reduction there is. It really just _x000D_
depends on what technologies they are using, and that has not _x000D_
been measured._x000D_
    For the small proportion that are subject to that 20 _x000D_
percent reduction, then there is still a little bit of debate _x000D_
about how much of a reduction there is with conventional _x000D_
ethanol because some people think that EPA's model has not _x000D_
effectively taken into account indirect land use, the effects _x000D_
on carbon emissions. But that aside, if you assume that that _x000D_
part has 20 percent and then the advanced biofuels that are in _x000D_
the market are 50 or more percent, then there has been a modest _x000D_
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but it will only grow _x000D_
significantly with growth of advanced biofuels."
2926504,2926503,2926505,19243,1,"    OK. Ms. McCabe, let me follow up on one _x000D_
thing on that, because Mr. Rusco brings up one of the issues _x000D_
and that is about land use. The original design of this was to _x000D_
make sure that grasslands did not suddenly have corn planted on _x000D_
them as well, and have expansion. Are you confident that right _x000D_
now, we do not have things that used to be grasslands being now _x000D_
used for corn, based on the ethanol requirement, and if so, how _x000D_
are you monitoring and assuring that?"
2926505,2926504,2926506,19243,1,"    That is something that we look at every year, _x000D_
for every rule, and we work with our fellow Federal agencies to _x000D_
make sure that we have the best information possible on that, _x000D_
and that, indeed, was the expectation, and in each rule we _x000D_
provide our analysis and the background information of how we _x000D_
have come to our conclusion that that is not happening."
2926506,2926505,2926507,19243,1,"    So if I remember correctly, and again, it _x000D_
is off the top of my head, about eight million additional acres _x000D_
are now corn that used to not be corn. So your confidence is _x000D_
that those were acres that were planted with wheat or with _x000D_
soybean or something else that are now corn. They were not just _x000D_
originally grasslands. They have now been transferred into corn _x000D_
use?"
2926507,2926506,2926508,19243,1,"    Well, I think I would like to have the _x000D_
opportunity to get back to you with more specifics on exactly _x000D_
what our analysis showed and the reasons for our conclusions."
2926508,2926507,2926509,19243,1,"    OK. That would be terrific._x000D_
    The one thing that I heard over and over again was, one of _x000D_
the reasons that we are not seeing the gain in ethanol is _x000D_
because the price of gasoline is too cheap, that if gasoline _x000D_
was $5 a gallon there would be not necessarily more incentive _x000D_
but the cost of the ethanol and the cellulosic would be closer _x000D_
in price, meaning that the more that we put some of the ethanol _x000D_
into gasoline now, with the lower price of gasoline that we _x000D_
face now, we are actually paying more per gallon for a gallon _x000D_
of gas with the ethanol blend than we would if it was 100 _x000D_
percent gasoline and was typical on it._x000D_
    Have you all been able to run any numbers on the cost--and _x000D_
again, that changes every day, with multiple features, based on _x000D_
the RINs prices, the price of crude oil, the price of the _x000D_
ethanol, where it is coming from. I get that. Have you all had _x000D_
any opportunity to be able to look at just snapshots of _x000D_
different days, what the differences in price are, based on _x000D_
ethanol or non-ethanol, and what that would be for the _x000D_
consumer?"
2926509,2926508,2926510,19243,1,"    We have not done that in the course of this _x000D_
work. In looking at past work, we did have an opportunity, _x000D_
years ago, to look at ethanol and gasoline prices and ethanol _x000D_
use. Most of this did not make it into a report, but we--and it _x000D_
was not really our objective--but just as we looked at it, you _x000D_
could see what looked like a strong correlation between the use _x000D_
of ethanol--when ethanol was below its--below the blend wall, _x000D_
significantly below the blend wall, and you would see that when _x000D_
ethanol prices were below gasoline prices there was more _x000D_
blending. So you would see that the market would work, that _x000D_
people were seeking the lowest cost fuel._x000D_
    But when you are at the blend wall and you have to blend _x000D_
that 10 percent, then that ability to blend less if the price _x000D_
of ethanol is higher than gasoline is gone, and so there you _x000D_
would see--if there are fluctuations you would see differences _x000D_
in the price of the final fuel that would reflect that."
2926510,2926509,2926511,19243,1,"    So the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) _x000D_
did a study in 2014. That is the most recent one that I could _x000D_
find and I have asked around, trying to be able to identify it, _x000D_
because this is a very complicated issue when you deal with the _x000D_
cost of fuel per day, and what that is and how that blends out. _x000D_
The most recent I could find was the CBO study in 2014. They _x000D_
looked at the RFS program and they tried to determine three _x000D_
alternative solutions or scenarios. One was compliance with _x000D_
total renewable fuel and advanced fuel mandates, corn ethanol _x000D_
cap as set by the RFS; the second one was hold future volume _x000D_
requirements at levels previously proposed, so the lower _x000D_
levels; and a third options was just repeal the RFS._x000D_
    This is the statement: ``The study evaluated the impacts of _x000D_
these three options on ethanol production and motor fuel _x000D_
prices. According to CBO, if the RFS was repealed or if its _x000D_
future mandates were kept at previously proposed 2014 levels, _x000D_
corn-based ethanol production would remain at 13 billion _x000D_
gallons''--it would still stay high--``and American consumers _x000D_
would have lower gas prices.''_x000D_
    The numbers that they ran behind that was that with a _x000D_
mandate--and then pulling the mandate away, if they removed the _x000D_
mandate it could reduce the price by up to 26 cents a gallon. _x000D_
Now this was, again, a study that was done in 2014, and then, _x000D_
for diesel, it could reduce it as much as 51 cents a gallon. _x000D_
Now that was a snapshot that they did at that point._x000D_
    The challenge that we have is trying to determine where we _x000D_
are with greenhouse gas emissions, and where we are with price _x000D_
to consumers. If they even dropped that down to a dime, if we _x000D_
have a dime a gallon more in cost right now, per gallon, for _x000D_
every gallon, with the mandate, and the study that they did, _x000D_
they said even if you repealed the RFS, at that time they were _x000D_
estimating that we would still use 13 billion gallons, tells me _x000D_
it is in the market, it is still out there, it is going to be _x000D_
used. It is not as if the mandate, if it is pulled away, _x000D_
suddenly no one will use ethanol. It seems to me that a lot of _x000D_
people like using ethanol, and it is a good fuel source, and it _x000D_
is an especially good source for octane boost, and it is _x000D_
plentiful, especially in the easier-to-produce areas like corn-_x000D_
based ethanol._x000D_
    So my question still comes back to, it seems to be raising _x000D_
the prices and not hitting the totals that we need for the _x000D_
greenhouse gas emissions, and if we remove the mandate we will _x000D_
still use it anyway. What am I missing here? Why is the mandate _x000D_
so important?"
2926511,2926510,2926512,19243,1,"    I cannot answer that, but you will definitely _x000D_
still use a lot of ethanol, as an oxygenative, an octane boost, _x000D_
if for no other reason. There is another thing that might _x000D_
happen but it will take a lot of other changes, and that is _x000D_
that auto makers could make high-compression fuels that would _x000D_
burn 30 percent ethanol and get great fuel economy, but that--_x000D_
again, there is no current market for that. But there is a lot _x000D_
of possibility to use ethanol. It is just not clear to us _x000D_
exactly how much would be used."
2926512,2926511,2926513,19243,1,"    If that would the primary fuel out there, _x000D_
then my folks in Oklahoma could not drive their 1978 Silverado _x000D_
Chevy pickup, because they would not have a good fuel option _x000D_
for that as well, and that is the other challenge that is in _x000D_
this._x000D_
    Ms. McCabe, why the mandate? Why is the mandate essential? _x000D_
If it is a good fuel, it is in the system, and it is out there, _x000D_
and we know it raises costs, why maintain the mandate?"
2926513,2926512,2926514,19243,1,"    Well, Senator, I also cannot answer on behalf _x000D_
of Congress, but I will reflect that my understanding of what _x000D_
Congress was also trying to do was to bring advanced and _x000D_
cellulosic fuels into the marketplace, and they were not _x000D_
already there, like ethanol, and those were new industries. _x000D_
They needed the push. They needed the mandate. They needed the _x000D_
subsidy, essentially, that the RFS provided in comparison to _x000D_
readily available petroleum fuels, and that that fit the goals _x000D_
of energy security and lower greenhouse gases, and Congress _x000D_
chose to use a mandate approach in order to achieve those _x000D_
goals."
2926514,2926513,2926515,19243,1,"    I would tell you, looking back on it, 10 _x000D_
years later, we obviously have seen great progress in corn-_x000D_
based ethanol. We have seen some progress in cellulosic and _x000D_
some progress in the advanced, and obviously progress in the _x000D_
biodiesel programs. But if the tax for that is 10 cents a _x000D_
gallon for every gallon of gasoline to be able to accomplish _x000D_
that, I am not sure most consumers would say so far that has _x000D_
been worth the cost, because that is a pretty high cost to pay, _x000D_
especially for those that are in poverty and on very limited _x000D_
incomes._x000D_
    So I would just challenge us, as Congress, to look again at _x000D_
ethanol and the mandate, and to be able to evaluate, is there a _x000D_
better way to accomplish the same thing, to incentivize fuel, _x000D_
without actually punishing the consumer so much every single _x000D_
gallon of gas, and a different alternative._x000D_
    I do not want to hog the time. I know we have several _x000D_
things to talk about still."
2926515,2926514,2926516,19243,1,"    Mr. Chairman, I think that we should _x000D_
always have a willingness to think about and reopen and explore _x000D_
new ideas on how we can do things better._x000D_
    I do dispute somewhat the notion that the only value that _x000D_
the mandate has had is, those expressed in the statute itself, _x000D_
which is greenhouse gas, which is looking at energy _x000D_
independence. I think that a variety of fuel sources, _x000D_
especially in transportation fuel, that up to this point there _x000D_
has not been the diversity that we have seen. We are seeing _x000D_
more electric cars. We are seeing more compressed natural gas _x000D_
as natural gas prices stay low, especially in fleet vehicles, _x000D_
especially in locomotives. Burlington Northern had a big _x000D_
project converting to compressed natural gas, when we saw that _x000D_
differential between natural gas prices and oil prices, diesel _x000D_
prices._x000D_
    So I think that one of the problems that we always have in _x000D_
this country is that we make decisions based on too short of a _x000D_
frame of our history, and I think that it was Congress's _x000D_
judgment that incentivizing and providing a market for biofuels _x000D_
was essential for our long-term economic well-being, both in _x000D_
terms of transportation fuels but, as I said in the past, in _x000D_
terms of developing technology which really can be _x000D_
extraordinary as we go to the next generation of advanced _x000D_
manufacturing as it relates to agricultural products. We move _x000D_
beyond fuel, fiber, and food, and we go into using this as a _x000D_
base for growth long-term, growth in advanced manufacturing and _x000D_
value-added manufacturing in agriculture._x000D_
    So I get what you are saying and I get that we need to have _x000D_
a broader discussion, but I also think that we have not had the _x000D_
time, given the disruption that we have had in looking at this, _x000D_
and the marketplace, and fluctuations in oil prices, to really _x000D_
see this experiment and to really see this whole system from a _x000D_
big picture, mile-high, beneficial value._x000D_
    I do not disagree with you, Mr. Chairman, that at 10-cent, _x000D_
if, in fact, you and I could agree on that number, a 10-cent _x000D_
cost to consumers is something we need to take very seriously, _x000D_
because it is, in aggregate, very high. But then what is the _x000D_
benefit to the economy long term, and not just in a five-or _x000D_
six-year window but in a 20-, 30-, 40-year window?_x000D_
    And, not to get on my high horse here, but I am well _x000D_
familiar with a facility called Great Plains Natural Gas. I _x000D_
have served on their board of directors. It is a syngas. It was _x000D_
a 1970s project that was done in response to the oil embargo, _x000D_
where we looked at what is our fuel that is abundant in this _x000D_
country? And we saw a lot of coal. We said, well, how about we _x000D_
gasify coal because we think we are going to be in a natural _x000D_
gas shortage?_x000D_
    So we went about that and eventually the consortium that _x000D_
made the investment bowed out because we deregulated natural _x000D_
gas. Natural gas prices literally went below a dollar an MCF. _x000D_
We found that we had too much natural gas on the market, again, _x000D_
a market manipulation that really was not reflecting true _x000D_
market conditions._x000D_
    But that facility chugged away, looking at byproducts, _x000D_
looking at how we could be part of the CO2 discussion, with CO2 _x000D_
injection. And, as a result, now we have a facility that has _x000D_
created huge economies in gasification of coal which could, in _x000D_
fact, lead to CO2 reductions overall as it relates to kind of _x000D_
the global economy. So how long did that take? The facility _x000D_
went online in 1984, and here we are, 30 years later, really _x000D_
having a meaningful discussion about the value of that _x000D_
facility._x000D_
    And so I just think that there is a real impulse in this _x000D_
country to look so short-sighted in terms of the time period, _x000D_
and these technologies can be extraordinarily important, and _x000D_
there is an incentive beyond just simply transportation fuels _x000D_
that I think need to be considered. Now, obviously, we have to _x000D_
go with the statute we have, which identifies what those goals _x000D_
are._x000D_
    And so, we will continue to have that discussion, but we _x000D_
also have to have the statute be enforced the way the statute _x000D_
was intended, to really evaluate the economic success. And, it _x000D_
is certainly not the first time the Chairman and I have _x000D_
disagreed about this subject, and it will not be the last. But _x000D_
I think that the issues that have been raised here are ongoing, _x000D_
and the issues that have been raised by the Chairman are issues _x000D_
that we need to stand ready to defend the statute going into _x000D_
the future._x000D_
    I am concerned about the reset. I am concerned that that _x000D_
creates more uncertainty in the market, and that because we _x000D_
have had this earlier market disruption that, as we look for _x000D_
investment, that is the sweet spot in all of this and we do not _x000D_
want to hinder and encumber the development of those _x000D_
technologies too quickly._x000D_
    So, Mr. Chairman, that is my----"
2926516,2926515,2926517,19243,1,"    That is your story and you are sticking _x000D_
to it."
2926517,2926516,2926518,19243,1,    Yes. You have it.
2926518,2926517,2926519,19243,1,"    Yes. I just want to remind you that the _x000D_
Department of Energy gave a $500 million-dollar grant to do a _x000D_
cellulosic facility in Kansas, that Shell just bought for $28 _x000D_
million recently, because it just did not prove to be viable _x000D_
long-term, and they may very well use that $28 million and _x000D_
convert that into something else in the future that may be very _x000D_
viable, and I hope they do."
2926519,2926518,2926520,19243,1,"    Yes. And I would suggest that if you _x000D_
looked at the history of Great Plains, it is exactly that--_x000D_
Federal loan guarantees that through negotiations, pennies on _x000D_
the dollar back to the Federal Government. But I would maintain _x000D_
that that facility on the prairie has enormous R&D benefit to _x000D_
our country."
2926520,2926519,2926521,19243,1,"    Mr. Rusco, give us a guess. For the _x000D_
cellulosic, you talk about the multiple generations to be able _x000D_
to move. All of this as you talk to people in the industry and _x000D_
you talked to the experts and the science folks, give us a _x000D_
guess of how many years it would take for a viability for _x000D_
cellulosic, and do you feel like it could reach any of the _x000D_
target numbers by 2022?"
2926521,2926520,2926522,19243,1,"    So I cannot guess how many years. So what we _x000D_
heard is----"
2926522,2926521,2926523,19243,1,"    Come on. That is what we do. We are in _x000D_
Congress. We guess. [Laughter.]"
2926523,2926522,2926524,19243,1,"    I will do my best. So it would take three to _x000D_
four, even five years to build a second-generation plant, and _x000D_
they think they might be able to achieve--some of the crews _x000D_
think they might be able to achieve, with a second-generation _x000D_
plant, maybe 25 percent efficiencies, but they are going to _x000D_
need to achieve well over 100 percent efficiencies to get close _x000D_
to that, and each generation they have to be able to achieve _x000D_
that._x000D_
    So if you figure they have to go four or five generations, _x000D_
even if they can get that low, right now they can see that the _x000D_
next generation might get them 25 percent lower in cost, but _x000D_
they need to be a lot--they need to cut costs by a lot more _x000D_
than that. If they can see this one and it is going to be _x000D_
three, four, five years out, if they can get the money to build _x000D_
it, then they have to figure out how to operate that and get _x000D_
that up and running, and then they have to build another _x000D_
generation and another one after that, so not by 2022."
2926524,2926523,2926525,19243,1,"    OK. Ms. McCabe, let us talk about the _x000D_
authorities the administration would have, any future _x000D_
administration, whatever it may be, between now and 2022, and _x000D_
then 2022 and beyond, for the reset. How broad are the _x000D_
authorities to be able to reset the numbers for the EPA?"
2926525,2926524,2926526,19243,1,"    So the statute gives some guidance to the _x000D_
Agency. I brought it right here, because I thought you might _x000D_
ask. But it is broad. It says that if those triggers are set _x000D_
that the Agency needs to look at recalculating the numbers all _x000D_
the way through 2022 for whatever category is being reset, and _x000D_
it gives a series of factors that the agency is supposed to _x000D_
consider."
2926526,2926525,2926527,19243,1,    Did they reconsider all three categories?
2926527,2926526,2926528,19243,1,    I am sorry?
2926528,2926527,2926529,19243,1,"    You talked about if they could reset the _x000D_
total amount, or any of the individual categories, or do all of _x000D_
the above?"
2926529,2926528,2926530,19243,1,"    Right. I mean, whatever categories that have _x000D_
been triggered that the Agency is moving forward with. Our _x000D_
thought is it is better to do them all at once, because of the _x000D_
interconnecting relationships. So we would undertake a notice _x000D_
and comment rulemaking and background work to look at all of _x000D_
those factors, to put forward a proposal based on the _x000D_
experience of the program to date and the expectations going _x000D_
forward, and as Mr. Rusco has said, there are just so many _x000D_
factors, and we do not know what is going to happen with oil _x000D_
prices in the future, and just a variety of other things. But _x000D_
we would have a public process to do that so everybody could _x000D_
weigh in."
2926530,2926529,2926531,19243,1,"    A couple of quick questions. We are going _x000D_
to run out of time but I want to be able to honor everyone's _x000D_
time. One of the main goals of the RFS was to get us off any _x000D_
imported energy sources. What percentage right now of RFS _x000D_
volume uses any imported source, whether that be Brazilian _x000D_
sugar cane, or any other outside of the United States feedstock _x000D_
source?"
2926531,2926530,2926532,19243,1,"    Yes. I do not have a precise number for you but _x000D_
we can get you a number. It is small."
2926532,2926531,2926533,19243,1,"    But there are some things that are _x000D_
foreign sources, that are actually being permitted right now?"
2926533,2926532,2926534,19243,1,"    Yes. The statute does not distinguish between _x000D_
imported and domestic, and it really varies a lot, depending on _x000D_
all kinds of different factors that have nothing to do with RFS _x000D_
or domestic policy. But it is small."
2926534,2926533,2926535,19243,1,"    You had mentioned as well, Ms. McCabe, _x000D_
about the obligated parties, and I am not going to try to work _x000D_
you into a corner--I am really not--on this. Help us understand _x000D_
the decision for the denial at this point, and to just say no, _x000D_
we are going to deny this, and help us understand what brought _x000D_
you to that point. As you know, both sides of the argument have _x000D_
expressed this to you very clearly, obviously. Some of the _x000D_
independent refiners that I know of have told me, point blank, _x000D_
the second most expensive part of their operation are RINs. It _x000D_
is crude oil and RINs. After that it is the energy for their _x000D_
facility and personnel and health care. But the second most _x000D_
expensive thing they have is something that is paper, that does _x000D_
not really exist anywhere except in the world of government, _x000D_
and that is the RINs purchase._x000D_
    So help us understand just the process that you went _x000D_
through to make this decision."
2926535,2926534,2926536,19243,1,"    Yes. So let me talk about the process first. So _x000D_
when we get petitions, it is up to the Agency to grant or deny _x000D_
them, and we not required to go through a proposal process to _x000D_
do that. In this case, we felt it was important, for one _x000D_
reason, because people across the board asked for a public _x000D_
forum to be able to put information forward and have that _x000D_
conversation, but also because we felt that it was an _x000D_
opportunity for us to put forward our best thinking, at this _x000D_
moment, of the information that we have received. And as you _x000D_
have acknowledged, people are in very different places, and _x000D_
they are not only clear, they are vehement, and I have sat in _x000D_
many meetings, my staff have gone to some of these facilities, _x000D_
we have had many conversations where people will come in with _x000D_
the same exact data and say one thing to us one day, and then _x000D_
another group will look at the same data and say exactly the _x000D_
opposite to us._x000D_
    And so we are trying to sort all this through, and one of _x000D_
the questions that I was getting from people, as I was having _x000D_
these meetings, was, ``Well, tell us what you think about what _x000D_
you are seeing.'' So we thought it was fair to do that, and to _x000D_
put our thinking out in a proposal. So rather than just say--to _x000D_
open it up for, ``We do not know whether we are going to grant _x000D_
or deny it, but give us your thoughts''--we thought it would be _x000D_
a more meaningful opportunity for input if people could _x000D_
understand our thinking currently._x000D_
    We tried to lay it out very clearly, our analysis of the _x000D_
objections and the points that people were making to us. Nobody _x000D_
is denying that RINs are a significant cost for businesses that _x000D_
buy them, but there is a complicated interplay between whether _x000D_
the value of that RIN is recovered through the products that _x000D_
they sell--and again, there is a wide range----"
2926536,2926535,2926537,19243,1,    Which is then passed on to the consumer.
2926537,2926536,2926538,19243,1,"    Well, or maybe not. That is complicated too, _x000D_
and I think it bears a lot of discussion by people who are much _x000D_
smarter on the economics of this than I am. I would not presume _x000D_
to be an expert on that. But I think there is a range of views _x000D_
on whether the consumer does see those costs or whether they _x000D_
are passed back and forth among the regulated industry._x000D_
    So people have different views on this and we wanted to try _x000D_
to lay that out as best we could. I know we will get lots and _x000D_
lots of input."
2926538,2926537,2926539,19243,1,"    I am all for an open process on it. It is _x000D_
a complicated, difficult issue. I am exceptionally skeptical _x000D_
that any industry could have a $200 million cost, for instance, _x000D_
for a small manufacturer, or for a small refiner, and that that _x000D_
would not be then passed on to the consumer in some ways. If _x000D_
your second-highest cost of your business is an item, you do _x000D_
not swallow that and the other folks do not swallow that. The _x000D_
consumer does at the end. That is part of that 10-cent increase _x000D_
that we see just in cost that is sitting out there, if we can _x000D_
agree on a simple number, because that ongoing cost has to go _x000D_
somewhere._x000D_
    So that will be part of--by the way, I do not think that _x000D_
goes away if you shift the obligation. I am not saying that it _x000D_
does. So I am not arguing one way or the other. What I hear _x000D_
from people is, just tell us how the process is going, and the _x000D_
more open the process can be, or not, is better. I had _x000D_
integrated retail folks that have, as a part of their business _x000D_
model, the RINs that they produce and then sell, and it is part _x000D_
of their business model now, and it is exceptionally helpful to _x000D_
them as a company. And I have other groups that are refiners, _x000D_
that struggle exceptionally under this._x000D_
    So I get that part of the business. The hard part is just _x000D_
the consistency, and trying to guess how to predict a RINs _x000D_
price, and it is, as you know, very hard to predict a RINs _x000D_
price, and when it is such a large part of your business, _x000D_
everyone wants to know how to plan for the next year, and it is _x000D_
tough to do that when the RINs move so much."
2926539,2926538,2926540,19243,1,"    Yes. I will add, Senator, too, that we made a _x000D_
clear point that if we are looking for certainty in the system, _x000D_
changing the point of obligation now will completely undermine _x000D_
that. It would take multiple years to get that fixed. People _x000D_
will be arguing about how we should do it. So that is a _x000D_
consideration----"
2926540,2926539,2926541,19243,1,"    It is so much simpler if we just do away _x000D_
with the mandate entirely. That just fixes that entirely on _x000D_
both sides. [Laughter.]"
2926541,2926540,2926542,19243,1,"    I want to make a point about transparency _x000D_
in the RIN market. I think EPA has long recognized the _x000D_
potential for fraud and the concern about lack of transparency _x000D_
and volatility. You have implemented the quality assurance _x000D_
program, and I do not think we should leave this subject _x000D_
without acknowledging that and at least getting some feedback _x000D_
from you on whether that quality assurance project has worked._x000D_
    But you have also been working with Commodity Futures _x000D_
Trading Commission (CFTC) on a memorandum of understanding _x000D_
related to transparency and oversight. And so I do not know _x000D_
that we need to comment, given our short period of time, but I _x000D_
did want to acknowledge the work that you are doing outside of _x000D_
this debate, about, who has the obligation to try and make the _x000D_
program more transparent, to try and work cooperatively with _x000D_
the CFTC, to guarantee minimization of speculation and fraud."
2926542,2926541,2926543,19243,1,"    Yes. Thank you, Senator. We are looking at _x000D_
those opportunities every day, to try to provide more _x000D_
transparency."
2926543,2926542,2926544,19243,1,"    The only thing worse than a RIN is fake _x000D_
RIN, and that is what takes it away. [Laughter.]"
2926544,2926543,2926545,19243,1,"    Yes. Buy a fake RIN, that is pretty _x000D_
miserable."
2926545,2926544,2926546,19243,1,"    The last question that I have, unless you _x000D_
all had other comments, as well, Ms. McCabe, you and I, when we _x000D_
spoke last, you were in the process of dealing with the _x000D_
requirements for ozone in the ambient air quality, at the same _x000D_
time that you are dealing with the RFS, and we talked about the _x000D_
conflict between the two. Help me catch up on where that _x000D_
conversation is going right now, because, as you produce more _x000D_
ethanol it produces more ozone in those areas in the production _x000D_
part of it, at the same time we are dealing with reducing ozone _x000D_
nationwide as well."
2926546,2926545,2926547,19243,1,"    Yes. So back in 2010, when we did our analysis, _x000D_
when we put the rule in place, we did note that there were _x000D_
places and times where ozone air quality could be increased. It _x000D_
is not uniform, it is not across the board, it is not _x000D_
necessarily in places where the ozone standard is not met _x000D_
already, so those are all complicating factors._x000D_
    And, Senator, I think we are about where we were last time, _x000D_
which is that States and cities are working to meet the ozone _x000D_
standard. Most of those areas that are ozone non-attainment _x000D_
areas are large metropolitan areas, and so the contributors to _x000D_
ozone are overwhelmingly motor vehicles, generally, industry _x000D_
power plants, and large emitters. But I am certainly not _x000D_
denying that we have found that there could be some increases _x000D_
in ozone as a result of ethanol."
2926547,2926546,2926548,19243,1,"    I did notice, as well, that you and _x000D_
others had very different--the EIA had a number for what is E-_x000D_
0, at quite a bit higher, while you all have estimated what the _x000D_
E-0 number is as well. I think we are around 200 million and _x000D_
they were somewhere around five billion or something."
2926548,2926547,2926549,19243,1,"    Yes. It was order of magnitude. So that is the _x000D_
kind of discrepancy that gets people sitting down and talking _x000D_
to one another, which we did, and worked out that we were _x000D_
looking at different points in the process. So we were looking _x000D_
at the retail level. Their numbers were reflecting a point _x000D_
higher up in the supply chain._x000D_
    So we feel we have resolved that discrepancy between the _x000D_
two agencies."
2926549,2926548,2926550,19243,1,"    I would assume, then, the higher number _x000D_
still is used in the United States, or the lower number is what _x000D_
is used in the United States?"
2926550,2926549,2926551,19243,1,"    We were looking at what is used at retail, what _x000D_
is expected to be needed at retail----"
2926551,2926550,2926552,19243,1,"    Right._x000D_
opposed to E-0 somewhere else in the supply chain then being _x000D_
blended later."
2926552,2926551,2926553,19243,1,    OK.
2926553,2926552,2926554,19243,1,    If that makes sense.
2926554,2926553,2926555,19243,1,"    It does make sense then._x000D_
    Any other final comments that the two of you need to make, _x000D_
that we did not cover?"
2926555,2926554,2926556,19243,1,    Nope.
2926556,2926555,2926557,19243,1,"    Mr. Rusco, your report is very thorough. _x000D_
I appreciate that. And hopefully in the days ahead we can get _x000D_
some good consistency on numbers and costs, because that is one _x000D_
of _x000D_
the areas that is missing, still, is to try to figure out this _x000D_
number--what does it really cost the consumer? We have some _x000D_
estimates but industry has not been able to do an estimate, we _x000D_
have not been able to get an independent estimate, and we are _x000D_
all kind of guessing what that would be at this point, based on _x000D_
some numbers that are several years old._x000D_
    And so it would be extremely helpful for us to be able to _x000D_
get a good snapshot, even if it was literally grabbing one day _x000D_
a month for a year, and then just snapshotting those days, this _x000D_
is what the estimated cost would be with or without the _x000D_
mandate, or with or without ethanol, because I would assume _x000D_
some days that it is less expensive, and it depends on the _x000D_
price of oil at that time. But I would also assume many days it _x000D_
is more expensive, especially with a lower oil price right now, _x000D_
with what we have._x000D_
    So hopefully in the days ahead we can get that kind of _x000D_
number._x000D_
    Any final comments?"
2926557,2926556,2926558,19243,1,    No. Thank you.
2926558,2926557,2926559,19243,1,"    Thank you, both. Let me see if I have got _x000D_
a very formal closing statement for you to be able to make._x000D_
    That concludes today's hearing. There is my formal _x000D_
statement. I would like to thank the witnesses for their _x000D_
testimony. The hearing record will remain open for 15 days _x000D_
until the close of business on December 16, for submission of _x000D_
statements and questions for the record._x000D_
    What that, this hearing is adjourned."
2926559,2926558,2926560,19244,1,"    Good morning, everyone. I would like to _x000D_
welcome you to today's Subcommittee hearing that will focus on _x000D_
the recommendations made by the Government Accountability _x000D_
Office (GAO) and the Inspectors General (IG) to improve _x000D_
government efficiency._x000D_
    We all want a Federal Government that serves the American _x000D_
people in the most effective and efficient way. The Government _x000D_
Accountability Office and agencies' Inspectors General are on _x000D_
the front lines in combating waste, fraud, and mismanagement _x000D_
within the Government. Their audits and investigations are _x000D_
vital in uncovering and eliminating the billions of waste and _x000D_
mismanagement of taxpayer dollars._x000D_
    Through reports, recommendations, and their High-Risk List, _x000D_
GAO serves Congress and the public by conducting oversight of _x000D_
how Federal dollars are spent. The mission is particularly _x000D_
vital today as we face a Federal debt approaching $19 trillion. _x000D_
Last year, GAO saved the taxpayers a record $74.7 billion, _x000D_
bringing their total to over a half a trillion dollars saved _x000D_
since 2003._x000D_
    Despite these important and impressive results, agencies _x000D_
consistently fail to implement roughly 20 percent of what GAO _x000D_
recommends each year._x000D_
    While GAO looks for waste across government, Inspectors _x000D_
General are uniquely positioned to focus on and work within _x000D_
their respective agency and play a critical role in _x000D_
congressional oversight. IG recommendations also have the _x000D_
potential to save significant taxpayer dollars, but there are _x000D_
709 unimplemented recommendations at the Department of Justice _x000D_
(DOJ) alone._x000D_
    I recently published a report titled ``Federal Fumbles'' _x000D_
that described 100 examples of wasteful spending and burdensome _x000D_
regulations while also proposing solutions to each of these _x000D_
problems. I relied extensively on GAO and IG recommendations _x000D_
for this report and acknowledge that this report sheds light on _x000D_
only a small fraction of the waste that GAO and IGs identify _x000D_
every year._x000D_
    When looking at this issue, it is important to remember _x000D_
that this is not an adversarial conversation. Creating a _x000D_
responsible, efficient government is something we all can and _x000D_
should agree on, and I find many Federal employees that _x000D_
struggle with the waste that they clearly see every day in _x000D_
their agencies and look for ways and outside accountability to _x000D_
be able to help them solve it. It is important for Congress to _x000D_
take an active role and ensure that the GAO, IGs, and agencies _x000D_
work together to eliminate waste and mismanagement, and I look _x000D_
forward to this conversation today._x000D_
    With that, I would like to recognize Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp for her opening remarks."
2926560,2926559,2926561,19244,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Lankford, and thank _x000D_
you, all of you, for your service and for agreeing to come here _x000D_
during the holiday season. We really appreciate it. This has _x000D_
been an incredibly active Subcommittee, probably the most _x000D_
active Subcommittee in all of the Senate, because this is a _x000D_
Committee where we come to talk about how we can do things _x000D_
better. And if anyone thinks you cannot do things better, they _x000D_
are wrong. Nobody is perfect. We have to constantly be _x000D_
striving._x000D_
    The Federal Government spends hundreds of millions of _x000D_
dollars annually to have Federal programs audited and _x000D_
investigated by the Government Accountability Office and the _x000D_
Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs). The GAO and IGs spend _x000D_
their days providing incredibly valuable recommendations on how _x000D_
the Federal Government can be more effective and efficient with _x000D_
those sacred taxpayer dollars._x000D_
    This type of oversight is critical and valuable. The _x000D_
American people can be sure that their taxpayer dollars are _x000D_
being used wisely when agencies like GAO and IG recommendations _x000D_
are taken seriously and that we use these recommendations to _x000D_
make government more efficient and better._x000D_
    Our hearing today is about learning more about how we can _x000D_
improve agency follow up and make sure that everyone is doing _x000D_
their part in assessing and improving recommendations and _x000D_
recommendation follow up. The work that GAO and Inspectors _x000D_
General perform in providing recommendations to agencies is _x000D_
important, and the recommendations should not go unimplemented _x000D_
or unnecessarily delayed._x000D_
    I want to just point out one of the topics I want to cover _x000D_
today, and as you can see from the Audit Process over to the _x000D_
side, on the chart\1\ on the left, a great deal of planning and _x000D_
many hours of work go into the auditing process by GAO and IGs. _x000D_
We want to make sure that that the hard work does not go _x000D_
unnoticed, unappreciated, and certainly unimplemented._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Heitkamp appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 125._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    But I want to also draw your attention to the lower left-_x000D_
hand side. You will see GAO's work on monitoring and _x000D_
implementation of recommendations. Over the years, GAO has _x000D_
taken a number of steps to increase oversight of whether their _x000D_
recommendations have been implemented. The GAO maintains an _x000D_
online database of open recommendations that still need to be _x000D_
addressed by agencies. And according to GAO's website, the goal _x000D_
of the recommendation database is to ``help congressional and _x000D_
agency leaders prepare for appropriations and oversight _x000D_
activities, as well as help improve government operations.'' _x000D_
Because of this database of open recommendations, we know that _x000D_
there are almost 4,600 open recommendations with Federal _x000D_
agencies. This is a huge number, and it is not insignificant. I _x000D_
hope we can discuss today how we can lower that number, move _x000D_
forward and give you the tools to continue to do your excellent _x000D_
work._x000D_
    I also want you to take a look at the other side of the _x000D_
chart when we look at the recommendations that Inspectors _x000D_
General provide. They operate differently than GAO. It is a _x000D_
little more challenging for us as decisionmakers here to know _x000D_
how Federal agencies are responding to Inspector General _x000D_
recommendations. The information is not as transparent as what _x000D_
it is at GAO. And while the IGs are required by law to provide _x000D_
a semiannual report to Congress tracking audit recommendation _x000D_
implementation, each IG has their own system for tracking those _x000D_
recommendations._x000D_
    IGs do not maintain a centralized database in which all _x000D_
outstanding recommendations governmentwide are input, stored, _x000D_
and accessible to Members of Congress and the public. While we _x000D_
know there are IGs doing terrific work, great work, we need to _x000D_
know about that follow up, and we need to see if we have _x000D_
inconsistencies across agencies._x000D_
    Every agency operates differently, but a lot of these _x000D_
recommendations, I would assume, are fairly consistent across _x000D_
the board. So it is not just Congress that would win with _x000D_
having a more open process regarding IG recommendations, but _x000D_
other IGs, taking a look at the work that is being done by _x000D_
their colleagues._x000D_
    Today's hearing is about learning the recommendation follow _x000D_
up practices that work for agencies and figuring out how we can _x000D_
do more, how we can reduce those numbers of recommendations _x000D_
that are not implemented. We are not here, as you know, in this _x000D_
Committee to place blame. This is the good government _x000D_
Committee, and everybody should be for good government. There _x000D_
is no controversy about this. I think just as you are very _x000D_
nonpartisan--not bipartisan but nonpartisan--this Committee has _x000D_
been very nonpartisan in how we evaluate and look at some of _x000D_
these challenges of inefficient government._x000D_
    And so I want to thank Chairman Lankford for his excellent _x000D_
leadership, and we look forward to hearing this testimony and _x000D_
having an ongoing dialogue this morning."
2926561,2926560,2926562,19244,1,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    At this time we will proceed with testimony from our _x000D_
witnesses. Let me introduce our three witnesses. Then we will _x000D_
swear each in._x000D_
    Mr. Gene Dodaro is the Comptroller of the United States. He _x000D_
is the head of the Government Accountability Office. As _x000D_
Comptroller General, Mr. Dodaro helps oversee the development _x000D_
and issuance of hundreds of reports and testimonies each year _x000D_
to various committees and individual Members of Congress. These _x000D_
and other GAO products have led to hearings, legislation, _x000D_
billions of dollars in taxpayer savings, and improvements to a _x000D_
wide range of government programs and services._x000D_
    Mr. Dodaro, how many hearings do you think you have _x000D_
testified before?"
2926562,2926561,2926563,19244,1,    At least 150.
2926563,2926562,2926564,19244,1,    That is impressive just to survive that.
2926564,2926563,2926565,19244,2,    I do.
2926565,2926564,2926566,19244,2,    I do.
2926566,2926565,2926567,19244,2,    I do.
2926567,2926566,2926568,19244,2,"    Thank you. You may be seated._x000D_
    Let the record reflect the witnesses all answered in the _x000D_
affirmative._x000D_
    We will be using a timer system in front of you. Most of _x000D_
you are very familiar with that. As you know, your written _x000D_
testimony is a part of the permanent record. Anything you would _x000D_
like to add to that in your oral testimony, we will be glad to _x000D_
be able to receive._x000D_
    Mr. Dodaro, since you are a rookie at this, we will take _x000D_
you first. [Laughter.]_x000D_
_x000D_
   TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE GENE L. DODARO,\1\ COMPTROLLER _x000D_
 GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, U."
2926568,2926567,2926569,19244,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you, _x000D_
Ranking Member Senator Heitkamp, Senator Tester. I appreciate _x000D_
the opportunity to be here today to talk about GAO's work._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Dodaro appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 38._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Our mission is to support the Congress in carrying out its _x000D_
responsibilities, but also to help improve the performance and _x000D_
ensure the accountability of the Federal Government for the _x000D_
benefit of the American people._x000D_
    One of the chief ways that we do this is to make _x000D_
recommendations to improve government operations and _x000D_
activities. On average, we issue about 1,800 recommendations _x000D_
each year. As has been noted in your opening statement, Mr. _x000D_
Chairman, about 80 percent of our recommendations on average _x000D_
are implemented within a 4-year period of time._x000D_
    The recommendations that are implemented have tremendous _x000D_
benefits to the government. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned that _x000D_
last year our recommendations resulted in over $74 billion in _x000D_
financial benefits to the government. That is a $134 return for _x000D_
every $1 invested in GAO._x000D_
    The Bipartisan Budget Act that just passed this year, _x000D_
covering fiscal years (FY) 2016 and 2017, for example, had over _x000D_
$30 billion in offsets to help avoid sequestration as a result _x000D_
of implementing GAO's recommendations. So both cost savings and _x000D_
revenue enhancements are always on our mind, and we are trying _x000D_
to press that._x000D_
    But there are thousands of other benefits that occur as a _x000D_
result of implementation of our recommendations. There are _x000D_
enhanced services to veterans, children, the elderly. There are _x000D_
improvements in public safety and security. There is _x000D_
strengthening of our homeland security and national defense _x000D_
operations. There is bolstering of our cyber defenses as a _x000D_
result of implementing our recommendations, and a wide range of _x000D_
program improvements across the full spectrum of the Federal _x000D_
Government's programs and activities. So we are very proud of _x000D_
that record._x000D_
    Now, as you mentioned, Senator Heitkamp, there are a lot of _x000D_
open recommendations. There are over 4,600 for the 24 major _x000D_
Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies, and if you _x000D_
include, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and a wide _x000D_
range of smaller agencies, there are another 1,000 that are _x000D_
outstanding. So there is a lot of work to be done. _x000D_
Implementation of these open recommendations can result in tens _x000D_
of billions of dollars in additional savings and can result in _x000D_
improved program operations and help the Federal Government _x000D_
carry out its services to citizens across the country more _x000D_
efficiently._x000D_
    Now, in order to encourage implementing our _x000D_
recommendations, we carry out a wide variety of activities, and _x000D_
I will highlight some of them, given your interest in follow _x000D_
up. We start with the audit process. During the audit process _x000D_
itself, if we have recommendations for agencies to take action _x000D_
right away, we encourage that, and that happens on occasion._x000D_
    We provide draft reports to agencies for comment, and _x000D_
include their comments on whether they agree with the _x000D_
recommendations that we are proposing. And, by and large, _x000D_
agencies agree with many of our recommendations._x000D_
    One important point I would make is that for most of the _x000D_
open recommendations, agencies have agreed to implement them. _x000D_
They just have not executed and implemented them yet._x000D_
    Then 60 days after GAO issues a report, by law, the _x000D_
agencies have to provide a report to the Congress about their _x000D_
response to our recommendations, and that follow up process has _x000D_
been in place now for about 40 years. I would like to take a _x000D_
look at it and make sure it is best serving the needs of the _x000D_
Congress, particularly in the current budget environment. We _x000D_
will be doing a reexamination of that process to assure it is _x000D_
used effectively._x000D_
    And then we follow up on our recommendations to agencies at _x000D_
least once a year. Also, I meet on a regular basis with the _x000D_
Deputy Director for Management at OMB and the heads of major _x000D_
departments and agencies about implementing recommendations _x000D_
related to the high-risk areas we identified. We issue the _x000D_
overlap and duplication report each year. That includes a _x000D_
scorecard for the recommendations implemented by the Executive _x000D_
Branch as well as recommendations we have made to the Congress. _x000D_
We can expand that and do more in order to show the overall _x000D_
number of recommendations we have for the Congress. Right now _x000D_
we have close to 200 open recommendations to the Congress. _x000D_
About a third of them are the ones we report in the overlap, _x000D_
duplication, and fragmentation report._x000D_
    We are very focused on this. One of the reasons you see an _x000D_
elaborate process, Senator Heitkamp, as you pointed out, is _x000D_
that we judge our performance not on how many reports we issue _x000D_
or how many recommendations we make, but how many are _x000D_
implemented and what kind of benefits we have brought to the _x000D_
Federal Government as a result of the investment that all of _x000D_
you make in the GAO each year._x000D_
    So, again, thank you for the opportunity to be here today, _x000D_
and I would be happy to answer any of your questions."
2926569,2926568,2926570,19244,2,"    Thank you. Mr. Horowitz._x000D_

 TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ,\1\ INSPECTOR _x000D_
GENERAL, U."
2926570,2926569,2926571,19244,2,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Heitkamp, _x000D_
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to _x000D_
testify at this important hearing today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Horowitz appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 77._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    The Federal Inspector General community issues thousands of _x000D_
recommendations each year that help make our government more _x000D_
effective and efficient and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in _x000D_
government programs. One of the many important responsibilities _x000D_
that IGs have is to ensure that agencies are implementing those _x000D_
recommendations and that identified cost findings are remedied._x000D_
    To remain vigilant in this effort, OIGs maintain _x000D_
information about unimplemented recommendations, analyze agency _x000D_
efforts to close those recommendations, and request and respond _x000D_
to agency status updates. In addition, we issue semiannual _x000D_
reports that include information identifying significant _x000D_
recommendations for which corrective action has not been _x000D_
completed._x000D_
    At my office at the DOJ OIG, we have developed a robust _x000D_
process to follow up and ensure implementation on our _x000D_
recommendations. Where the Department has agreed with an OIG _x000D_
recommendation, which is almost always the case, the Department _x000D_
will seek to demonstrate to us how it has addressed the _x000D_
concerns we have identified that gave rise to the _x000D_
recommendation. We only close a recommendation after we conduct _x000D_
an independent analysis on that information and we determine _x000D_
that sufficient actions have been taken to close the _x000D_
recommendation. For those that remain unimplemented, the _x000D_
Department must provide us with periodic status reports on how _x000D_
they are proceeding toward closing that recommendation._x000D_
    In those rare instances where the Department does not agree _x000D_
with an OIG recommendation, we undertake an accelerated _x000D_
resolution process. If no agreement is reached with the _x000D_
Department within 6 months, we then elevate that to the _x000D_
leadership of the Department, and we report it to Congress in _x000D_
our semiannual report so that there is transparency around that _x000D_
kind of an issue._x000D_
    In addition, every 6 months we provide to the Department's _x000D_
leadership and Congress a report on unimplemented OIG _x000D_
recommendations. That is something that we began within the _x000D_
last 2 years in an effort to reduce the number of open _x000D_
recommendations in the Department and to elevate it to a higher _x000D_
level and ensure there was high-level oversight. That has _x000D_
proven to be very effective._x000D_
    We have had the Deputy Attorney General and her staff _x000D_
follow up on those recommendations and see action with the _x000D_
Department components as a result. We have appreciated the _x000D_
leadership's support for the process, and having them involved, _x000D_
having leadership involved, has proven to be beneficial._x000D_
    In addition, the Department's leadership just implemented _x000D_
this month a new system that will utilize Justice Management _x000D_
Division auditors to track unimplemented recommendations and to _x000D_
work with Department components to make the changes necessary _x000D_
to implement them, and we are hopeful that that new process _x000D_
will further move us toward closing more and more _x000D_
recommendations in a timely fashion._x000D_
    In a further effort to ensure that our recommendations are _x000D_
implemented, we often conduct follow up reviews to assess _x000D_
compliance. We are in the middle of one on the Fast and Furious _x000D_
recommendations, for example. Additionally, we will often issue _x000D_
in the course of our reviews and audits interim reports or _x000D_
Management Advisory Memoranda where we see issues that require _x000D_
immediate action. And as Gene said, one of the things we _x000D_
frequently do is inform the Department as we are learning about _x000D_
information of problems we find so they can take immediate _x000D_
action to resolve the problems._x000D_
    We also try and take proactive steps to address issues. We, _x000D_
of course, as every IG does, issue Top Management and _x000D_
Performance Challenges that summarize the issues we have seen _x000D_
in the past and we foresee in the future that the Department _x000D_
should be looking at._x000D_
    We have also engaged, as an example, in our grant fraud and _x000D_
grant oversight work in an interagency process and created a _x000D_
working group that brings together IGs and various Department _x000D_
components--OMB is involved as well--trying to identify _x000D_
challenges associated with administering grant programs. That _x000D_
group has pulled together documents and recommendations about _x000D_
improving grant administration and how to improve internal _x000D_
controls in that regard. My office separately has issued _x000D_
guidance in that area as well, all in an effort to increase and _x000D_
promote proactively increased effectiveness in our oversight _x000D_
efforts._x000D_
    We are committed to working as a community to implement _x000D_
corrective actions that improve the effectiveness and _x000D_
efficiency of the government, and we appreciate this Committee _x000D_
and the Congress' bipartisan support for those efforts, and we _x000D_
look forward to working with you and the agencies to further _x000D_
that process._x000D_
    Thank you."

 TESTIMONY OF JIM H. CRUMPACKER,\1\ DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENTAL GAO-_x000D_
    OIG LIAISON OFFICE, U."
2926572,2926571,2926573,19244,2,"    Good morning, Chairman Lankford, Ranking _x000D_
Member Heitkamp, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. _x000D_
I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to _x000D_
discuss the Department of Homeland Security's interactions with _x000D_
the Government Accountability Office and our Office of _x000D_
Inspector General. I am the career executive management _x000D_
official responsible for maintaining mutually beneficial and _x000D_
productive relations with GAO and the OIG. Previously, I held _x000D_
leadership positions within the Offices of Inspector General at _x000D_
the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Postal _x000D_
Service (USPS) and with the Air Force Audit Agency. I am also a _x000D_
certified internal auditor and a certified fraud examiner._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Crumpacker appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 84._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Today I am proud to say that the Department's relations _x000D_
with GAO and the DHS OIG have never been stronger or healthier. _x000D_
This is attributable to sustained senior leadership commitments _x000D_
from multiple Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, General _x000D_
Counsels, and Under Secretaries of Management to having open _x000D_
and transparent relations with our auditors. In turn, this has _x000D_
resulted in a changed culture across DHS from one in which _x000D_
audits were generally viewed as unimportant to one where _x000D_
leadership, program officials, and others at all organizational _x000D_
levels now understand that audits are important and deserve an _x000D_
appropriate level of attention among competing priorities and _x000D_
demands in protecting the homeland._x000D_
    In addition, continuous senior leadership focus sustaining _x000D_
this change has been dependent on strengthening and improving _x000D_
the Departmental GAO OIG Liaison Office and our DHS-wide audit _x000D_
liaison community._x000D_
    My office is responsible for facilitating successful _x000D_
outcomes for everyone involved in the process, including _x000D_
activities related to auditor access to records and employees, _x000D_
tracking the resolution and closure of recommendations, and _x000D_
supporting and providing oversight of component audit liaison _x000D_
activities throughout the Department._x000D_
    Within each component, we also have a senior component _x000D_
accountable official responsible for GAO and OIG activities _x000D_
that works with my office. Our overriding goals are to ensure _x000D_
that all parties that need to be involved in audits are _x000D_
involved; that audits are worked in concert with our operating _x000D_
principles of engagement, responsiveness, and mutual respect; _x000D_
that audit issues are worked at the lowest organizational level _x000D_
possible and only elevated to more senior leadership when _x000D_
absolutely necessary; and that there are no surprises for _x000D_
anyone at the end of the process._x000D_
    We work collaboratively and as partners with our auditors _x000D_
while respecting their independence. For our employees, we _x000D_
start with clear expectations regarding interactions with _x000D_
auditors. DHS has a formal administrative policy issued in 2010 _x000D_
that acknowledges the important role GAO has and serves as a _x000D_
foundation of the Department's commitment to fully cooperating _x000D_
with GAO in its reviews consistent with well-established _x000D_
Executive Branch privileges and responsibilities._x000D_
    Expectations for cooperating with the OIG were reaffirmed _x000D_
in a memorandum that Secretary Johnson sent to all DHS _x000D_
employees in May 2014, updating similar guidance that former _x000D_
Secretary Chertoff issued in 2008._x000D_
    DHS has also instituted a number of formal processes to _x000D_
ensure it works collaboratively with auditors and, in turn, _x000D_
effectively resolves and implements audit findings and _x000D_
recommendations._x000D_
    For example, DHS has documented formal performance measures _x000D_
and goals for program offices to submit corrective action _x000D_
plans, perform quarterly reporting on these actions, and strive _x000D_
to close recommendations within 24 months. The current status _x000D_
of these measures and goals is briefed to the Deputy Secretary _x000D_
and other senior leaders on a bimonthly basis._x000D_
    DHS has also increased the standardization of its responses _x000D_
provided for draft GAO and OIG audit reports. Today a signed _x000D_
letter or memorandum is provided to the auditors for all _x000D_
reports having recommendations to the Department. This _x000D_
previously did not always happen._x000D_
    DHS firmly believes that following through on GAO and OIG _x000D_
recommendations is an integral part of good management and _x000D_
essential to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our _x000D_
programs, operations, and activities. We appreciate the GAO and _x000D_
OIG's understanding that this is a shared responsibility _x000D_
between management officials and auditors._x000D_
    Examples of a few of our successes include: closing more _x000D_
GAO and OIG audit recommendations than auditors have issued for _x000D_
the fifth year in a row; and steadily reducing the number of _x000D_
open DHS OIG recommendations by 65 percent, from a high of _x000D_
1,663 at the end of fiscal year 2011 to just 583 at the end of _x000D_
fiscal year 2015._x000D_
    DHS is in a very different place than it was just a few _x000D_
years ago with its GAO and OIG relationships. This not only _x000D_
includes the openness and transparency with which we work with _x000D_
our auditors and a significantly lower number of open _x000D_
recommendations, but also our institutional attitude toward _x000D_
oversight. We are committed to continuing improvements._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I _x000D_
would be pleased to address any questions the Committee may _x000D_
have."
2926573,2926572,2926574,19244,2,"    Thank you all three gentlemen._x000D_
    Senator Heitkamp and I are going to defer our questions to _x000D_
the end. I recognize Senator Tester for questions."
2926574,2926573,2926575,19244,2,"    Thank you, Chairman Lankford. I appreciate _x000D_
the hospitality, and, Ranking Member Heitkamp, the same. And _x000D_
thank you for your testimony. It is always good to see you, _x000D_
Gene. Michael, Jim, I do not know if we have had the _x000D_
opportunity to work together much, but we look forward to it _x000D_
this morning._x000D_
    This is the way I understand it, Gene: You issue a report. _x000D_
The agency has 60 days to return what they have done to address _x000D_
what you have pointed out. That is correct?"
2926575,2926574,2926576,19244,2,"    That is correct. But they also have an _x000D_
opportunity when we give them the draft report to comment as to _x000D_
whether they want to agree with the recommendation and to say _x000D_
what they are planning to do. Then there is the letter agencies _x000D_
write 60 days after the final report is issued. So there are _x000D_
two windows."
2926576,2926575,2926577,19244,2,"    And in that 60 days, that report goes to _x000D_
you, right, Jim, the report of what the agency has done?"
2926577,2926576,2926578,19244,2,"    No, sir. That is a letter that we sent to _x000D_
OMB and Congress with a copy to GAO. It is 60 days after we _x000D_
receive a copy of GAO's final report, 60 days from the date we _x000D_
receive that final report."
2926578,2926577,2926579,19244,2,"    OK. Let me get to the crux of my--and maybe _x000D_
I am wrong on this, but it is my understanding that this _x000D_
Committee--and I do not have a problem with that--gets the _x000D_
update on what the agency has done. Is that correct?"
2926579,2926578,2926580,19244,2,    That is correct.
2926580,2926579,2926581,19244,2,"    OK. So I also serve on Veterans' Affairs, _x000D_
which is an authorizing committee, and all of us serve on _x000D_
authorizing committees here. When does the authorizing _x000D_
committee get the results of that?"
2926581,2926580,2926582,19244,2,"    I believe they are supposed to get it within _x000D_
the 60-day window as well."
2926582,2926581,2926583,19244,2,    Simultaneously?
2926583,2926582,2926584,19244,2,    Yes.
2926584,2926583,2926585,19244,2,    Good. Solve that problem. Thank you.
2926585,2926584,2926586,19244,2,"    But I do think, Senator, that process has been _x000D_
in place for about 40 years right now, and I want to take a _x000D_
look at it. We are going to reexamine whether it is serving the _x000D_
needs of the Congress. So we are going to look at that, and we _x000D_
will give you the results of any suggestions we have for _x000D_
improving it."
2926586,2926585,2926587,19244,2,"    OK. This is for you, Gene, and Michael. Do _x000D_
you have the resources you need to do your job?"
2926587,2926586,2926588,19244,2,"    We are not at the optimum level I believe GAO _x000D_
needs to be."
2926588,2926587,2926589,19244,2,    How short are you?
2926589,2926588,2926590,19244,2,"    We do not have an appropriation for this year _x000D_
yet, but I am hopeful it will be sufficient. I mentioned to the _x000D_
appropriators I believe GAO's optimal level should be 3,250 _x000D_
people. Last year, we were slightly under 3,000. So, we are _x000D_
close, but we are not where we need to be."
2926590,2926589,2926591,19244,2,    OK. Michael.
2926591,2926590,2926592,19244,2,"    We have the same issue. We have asked for _x000D_
slightly increased funding to cover some of the additional _x000D_
challenges we face. We are waiting to see what happens through _x000D_
the appropriations process."
2926592,2926591,2926593,19244,2,"    OK. That sounds like you are about 10 _x000D_
percent short, Gene, by the numbers you gave?"
2926593,2926592,2926594,19244,2,    Correct.
2926594,2926593,2926595,19244,2,"    About the same thing with you, Michael?"
2926595,2926594,2926596,19244,2,    Correct.
2926596,2926595,2926597,19244,2,"    OK. That is fine._x000D_
    Are both of you given the access within the agencies that _x000D_
you need to be able to conduct the studies that you need to _x000D_
conduct?"
2926597,2926596,2926598,19244,2,"    We have had a number of issues over the last _x000D_
5 years, and in light of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion _x000D_
from July, the answer is that problem continues. The Department _x000D_
has tried to address it by setting up a process, but it is a _x000D_
non-independent process, and what we need is the IG Empowerment _x000D_
Act that this Committee has moved on to get through so that we _x000D_
can get that access again that we need."
2926598,2926597,2926599,19244,2,"    How about you, Gene?"
2926599,2926598,2926600,19244,2,"    Yes, we generally get the access that we need, _x000D_
although in some cases, I have to get involved and elevate it _x000D_
to the department head or get assistance from the Congress. But _x000D_
we are in pretty good shape._x000D_
    There is one area, though, where Congress could be very _x000D_
helpful. That is on the National Directory of New Hires that _x000D_
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains. _x000D_
Their interpretation of the law is that they are prevented from _x000D_
sharing that information with us. We do not agree with that _x000D_
legal interpretation. Access to it would make a significant _x000D_
advancement in our ability to identify improper payments across _x000D_
the government and help solve that problem. We have asked the _x000D_
Congress to confirm our access to that information."
2926600,2926599,2926601,19244,2,    Is there a bill to do that?
2926601,2926600,2926602,19244,2,"    I have been trying for three Congresses now to _x000D_
get this through."
2926602,2926601,2926603,19244,2,    Senator Heitkamp will take care of that.
2926603,2926602,2926604,19244,3,    I am counting on it.
2926604,2926603,2926605,19244,3,"    Michael, how many IG recommendations to _x000D_
agencies are out there currently?"
2926605,2926604,2926606,19244,3,"    I do not know the total number across all 72 _x000D_
IGs. In DOJ OIG, just about 700 is the number. That is down _x000D_
from about 800 2 or 3 years ago when we started the process, as _x000D_
I mentioned in my statement."
2926606,2926605,2926607,19244,3,"    Is that a reasonable number? Is that _x000D_
something we should be concerned about? Or is it that----"
2926607,2926606,2926608,19244,3,"    I think if you look at our aging report, on _x000D_
the internal side it is a reasonable number with the follow up _x000D_
that has occurred recently. We have currently over the last 3 _x000D_
years about 84 percent of our recommendations closed, so that _x000D_
is a pretty good number. The ones that linger longer tend to be _x000D_
the external grant-related reports, and that is where we need _x000D_
more vigilance, I think, generally."
2926608,2926607,2926609,19244,3,"    OK. And excuse me for running a little bit _x000D_
over, but this graph\1\--and I do not know who put this out. _x000D_
Maybe it was you, Mr. Chairman. Maybe it was the GAO. This _x000D_
graph shows the number of open recommendations, and it is _x000D_
amazing to me that the Department of Defense (DOD) has over two _x000D_
times as many as the next highest agency. And I know that there _x000D_
has never been an audit done on the Department of Defense. What _x000D_
is going on here, Gene? Can you tell me what--I mean, is it _x000D_
they just do not want to respond? Are they balking? Tell me _x000D_
what is going on._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The graph referenced by Senator Tester appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 101._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926609,2926608,2926610,19244,3,"    Yes, well, the Defense Department spends _x000D_
roughly half of all the discretionary spending in the Federal _x000D_
Government, so commensurate with that, we do a lot of audit _x000D_
work there. They have one of the lowest response rates of _x000D_
implementing our recommendations. They are more in the 70-_x000D_
percent range rather than the 80-percent range._x000D_
    Part of the issue is that we find lots of problems at DOD. _x000D_
One-quarter of our High-Risk List focuses on, the Department of _x000D_
Defense and its business practices, and it is very difficult to _x000D_
get these issues addressed. One of the reasons is it requires _x000D_
multiple components of the Defense Department to work together._x000D_
    Many of our recommendations on overlap, fragmentation, and _x000D_
duplication are for issues within the Defense Department. So it _x000D_
is a large operation."
2926610,2926609,2926611,19244,3,    But that is not an excuse.
2926611,2926610,2926612,19244,3,"    Well, I agree with that. I have sent letters _x000D_
recently to the heads of all major departments and agencies _x000D_
listing the total number of open recommendations and _x000D_
prioritizing which ones that I think require their personal _x000D_
attention. I have not yet received a response from the Defense _x000D_
Department. I have from other agencies."
2926612,2926611,2926613,19244,3,    When did you send that out?
2926613,2926612,2926614,19244,3,    I am going to follow up with them.
2926614,2926613,2926615,19244,3,"    When did you send that out to the _x000D_
departments?"
2926615,2926614,2926616,19244,3,"    The Defense one, in August."
2926616,2926615,2926617,19244,3,    And no response?
2926617,2926616,2926618,19244,3,"    Not yet, other than that they are working on _x000D_
it."
2926618,2926617,2926619,19244,3,"    OK. Well, I would just say that I think _x000D_
this should be concerning to everybody on the Committee, and I _x000D_
thank the Chairman for putting that chart in front of us. There _x000D_
is no doubt we are very proud of our military, but we need to _x000D_
make sure that we are not wasting dough."
2926619,2926618,2926620,19244,3,    Right.
2926620,2926619,2926621,19244,3,"    Thank you, guys. I thank all of you for _x000D_
what you do. I appreciate your service."
2926621,2926620,2926622,19244,3,"    Before we move to Senator Ernst, can I _x000D_
ask one quick clarification as well? You had mentioned this new _x000D_
hire database access for HHS. Can you give us greater clarity _x000D_
to that? What is missing and what you do not have access to?"
2926622,2926621,2926623,19244,3,"    Yes, this database was set up for child _x000D_
enforcement purpose for HHS, so it has all the current _x000D_
information on wage earnings by people across the country. We _x000D_
could use it for comparison purposes with programs within the _x000D_
Federal Government, that have eligibility criteria based on _x000D_
income levels. We find that that information is more current _x000D_
than anything else the Federal Government has. So if we cannot _x000D_
use that information to determine eligibility for means-tested _x000D_
Federal programs it limits our ability to address the high _x000D_
level of improper payments. We want to go in and match that _x000D_
database to eligibility decisions that agencies made for _x000D_
programs where there is an income eligibility determination._x000D_
    Now, we have obtained some of the data in the past, but we _x000D_
had to go to all 50 States to collect the information from the _x000D_
individual States because HHS would not provide it. It is not _x000D_
efficient. It takes a large amount of resources. There was a _x000D_
time when the Department was advising States not to cooperate _x000D_
with us."
2926623,2926622,2926624,19244,3,"    So HHS has said you do not have access to _x000D_
it because?"
2926624,2926623,2926625,19244,3,"    Well, in the law it says they are not to _x000D_
provide it to anybody other than specified agencies, and we do _x000D_
not think that Congress intended for that to mean not to give _x000D_
it to GAO. So we disagree with them on the legal _x000D_
interpretation, but we are stuck right now."
2926625,2926624,2926626,19244,3,    All right. Thank you. Senator Ernst.
2926626,2926625,2926627,19244,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp. I appreciate it._x000D_
    Thank you, gentlemen, for being here today. Your input is _x000D_
always very valuable to us, so I appreciate the time that you _x000D_
take._x000D_
    Mr. Dodaro, in 2015 you added VA Health Care to your High-_x000D_
Risk List, citing concerns about the VA's ability to ensure the _x000D_
timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of the _x000D_
health care the Department provides in a number of different _x000D_
areas. You mentioned that there are more than 100 GAO _x000D_
recommendations that have not been addressed by the agency, _x000D_
which is very concerning._x000D_
    Approximately one year later from when this report was _x000D_
released, can you tell us where the VA is on implementing some _x000D_
of these recommendations and how they are coming on their high-_x000D_
risk progress with that rating? And has there been what you _x000D_
would call significant progress made from the beginning of the _x000D_
year until now?"
2926627,2926626,2926628,19244,3,"    Thank you, Senator Ernst. There has not been _x000D_
significant progress. I am very disappointed that we have not _x000D_
seen a very good corrective action plan from VA to address the _x000D_
high-risk areas._x000D_
    Now, I know there are other assessments that have been made _x000D_
and set in law by the Veterans Choice Act in terms of the _x000D_
commission on care and an independent technical assessment. So _x000D_
they are receiving a lot of different recommendations._x000D_
    But I have been concerned. In fact, I have asked for a _x000D_
meeting with the Secretary. I am meeting with him tomorrow."
2926628,2926627,2926629,19244,3,    Very Good.
2926629,2926628,2926630,19244,3,"    We have a scheduled meeting to talk about the _x000D_
fact that I do not think they have a good plan. They have not _x000D_
made significant progress. A number of our recommendations _x000D_
overlap those of or are consistent with ones from these _x000D_
independent assessments that are being done now by other _x000D_
parties. So I think they need an integrated plan to address our _x000D_
concerns and those expressed by the IG and by others. And I _x000D_
have some ideas on how they could do that that I want to talk _x000D_
to the Secretary about. But I am concerned."
2926630,2926629,2926631,19244,3,"    OK. Thank you. I appreciate that honest and _x000D_
very straightforward response, because so many of us want to be _x000D_
great supporters of the VA, but we cannot right now because _x000D_
they are not providing the necessary services for our veterans. _x000D_
And so we need to continue talking about this. It is important. _x000D_
But more than talk, we need to make sure that the VA is _x000D_
actually following up, and if there is a way that we can assist _x000D_
with that, we need to make sure we are doing that."
2926631,2926630,2926632,19244,3,"    I will keep this Committee posted on our _x000D_
progress."
2926632,2926631,2926633,19244,3,"    OK. Thank you. I appreciate it._x000D_
    Also, following up with that, too, I cosponsored Senators _x000D_
Ayotte and Manchin's Duplication Elimination Act, which would _x000D_
require the President to submit to Congress a proposed joint _x000D_
resolution implementing recommendations outlined in your annual _x000D_
report on duplication. It also includes procedures for _x000D_
expedited consideration of the joint resolution in Congress, _x000D_
and I would just like to know what your thoughts are on that _x000D_
particular piece of legislation. We have seen that these _x000D_
Federal agencies have fully implemented only 36 percent of the _x000D_
recommendations, and I really think it is time that Congress _x000D_
starts holding someone responsible. So if you could just maybe _x000D_
talk a little bit about the legislation and what your thoughts _x000D_
are."
2926633,2926632,2926634,19244,3,"    I think it is a very good legislative _x000D_
initiative. I am supportive of it. I think it is necessary _x000D_
because many of our recommendations involve overlap and _x000D_
duplication among or between agencies across the Federal _x000D_
Government. Most of the 36 percent that have been implemented _x000D_
have been implemented where it involves one agency and they _x000D_
could take action. So you need leadership on the part of OMB _x000D_
and the President to work with multiple agencies and come up _x000D_
with an administration position on our recommendations. And _x000D_
this legislation would require that. I think that is fair. They _x000D_
either agree or they do not agree, or they are going to _x000D_
implement it or not. And then the Congress can take action on _x000D_
those areas._x000D_
    And it also helps where you have multiple congressional _x000D_
jurisdictions over some of these issues, too. I have advocated _x000D_
joint hearings in some of the committees. So you have, both _x000D_
within the Executive Branch and the Congress multiple parties _x000D_
that have to agree in order to implement our recommendations."
2926634,2926633,2926635,19244,3,"    Well, good. I appreciate that. And it goes _x000D_
to Senator Tester's point as well with the DOD. There is so _x000D_
much duplication within the DOD, and I think that we do need to _x000D_
hold people accountable and streamline and find efficiencies _x000D_
where we can. So thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Again, _x000D_
thank you very much. I appreciate that._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926635,2926634,2926636,19244,3,    Senator Heitkamp.
2926636,2926635,2926637,19244,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for _x000D_
holding this hearing._x000D_
    I want to get back to kind of collaboration, and I think, _x000D_
Gene, I have been asking you repeatedly whether it would be a _x000D_
good idea to prioritize recommendations. Let us say there is _x000D_
limited resources within the agency, kind of big bang for the _x000D_
buck. I failed to write this down, but I think you said for _x000D_
every dollar invested in GAO, you return over $130 in savings, _x000D_
right? Was it $135, Gene?"
2926637,2926636,2926638,19244,3,    134. You are only a buck off.
2926638,2926637,2926639,19244,3,"    OK, 134. That is what I was going to say. _x000D_
But that is a pretty good return on investment. But when people _x000D_
do not implement the recommendations, we are not only _x000D_
frustrating the purpose of government, but we are frustrating _x000D_
this opportunity for financial savings._x000D_
    So, when you look at the creation of a possible database _x000D_
that would serve kind of as a crosswalk across the top 25 open _x000D_
GAO recommendations and any related IG recommendations for _x000D_
agencies to address specific findings, can we look at a way of _x000D_
prioritizing or collaborating or actually--as we whittle down _x000D_
this number, if they take the low-hanging fruit--I do not want _x000D_
them always to take the low-hanging fruit, is my point, because _x000D_
doing the tough thing has the effect of having long-term _x000D_
systemic reforms that will reap rewards and financial _x000D_
opportunities going forward."
2926639,2926638,2926640,19244,3,"    Yes, I agree with you. And as a step in that _x000D_
direction----"
2926640,2926639,2926641,19244,3,"    That is always a good way to start an _x000D_
answer to the question: ``I agree with you.'' [Laughter.]"
2926641,2926640,2926642,19244,3,"    Well, I have learned something in over 100 _x000D_
hearings. But as a step in that direction, though, I have sent _x000D_
these letters to all major departments and agencies with the _x000D_
total number of recommendations, but also prioritizing them on _x000D_
a very limited number of areas where I think there are dollar _x000D_
savings and big improvements that could occur. We have shared _x000D_
those letters with the Congress, with the various committees, _x000D_
the appropriation and authorizing committees for the agencies. _x000D_
So we could start there with a list of those priority _x000D_
recommendations and make a major push where Congress could hold _x000D_
hearings, write follow up letters, et cetera. And then we can _x000D_
figure out a way to better institutionalize that in the _x000D_
database."
2926642,2926641,2926643,19244,3,"    Yes, I am very excited about what you are _x000D_
doing, and I hope you share with our staff all of those _x000D_
letters. Once again, it is the diffusion of all this authority. _x000D_
This is the Committee where it all can come together._x000D_
    Michael, thank you so much, and I am going to go back to my _x000D_
chart. Obviously, GAO has that consolidation. You are present, _x000D_
kind of the internal auditor, the internal watchdog in every _x000D_
agency, so we do not have that overarching view of what the IG _x000D_
recommendations are. There may be, some patterns that we can _x000D_
see that we need to take corrective action on. What do you _x000D_
think about doing a database, doing something like GAO does _x000D_
that can give us a better kind of view from a mile high _x000D_
perspective?"
2926643,2926642,2926644,19244,3,"    I think it is a great idea. I think the issue _x000D_
has been for us in the IG community--Congress created the _x000D_
Council of IGs in 2008 to try and place some of these _x000D_
functions. We have not been funded with an appropriation in any _x000D_
year since our creation. The last 4 years, we have asked to be _x000D_
included in the President's budget. We have not been. We have _x000D_
been funded through a variety of mechanisms, and we are talking _x000D_
about a request of about $4 million that we have asked for._x000D_
    Our budget this year is about $6.5 million. It takes a fair _x000D_
amount of staff to do that kind of work and information _x000D_
technology (IT) infrastructure as well. We do not think we even _x000D_
have the IT capacity to do that at this point without an actual _x000D_
appropriated direct appropriation to do it."
2926644,2926643,2926645,19244,3,"    It is just so frustrating because this is _x000D_
so penny-wise and pound-foolish, I mean, to not have agencies _x000D_
like yours fully funded, in fact, not even challenge you to amp _x000D_
up your work, to realize more savings. And so we want to _x000D_
participate and play a pretty active role in encouraging and _x000D_
being your advocate here to get that level of funding, because _x000D_
I think that it would be very enlightening to see those _x000D_
recommendations across agencies and see what we are seeing over _x000D_
and over again as recurring patterns of inefficiency."
2926645,2926644,2926646,19244,3,"    And just to pick up the investment point, _x000D_
every dollar invested in IGs returns about $18 in much the same _x000D_
way. And that does not count, for example, in my agency all the _x000D_
non-dollar-related work we do like on a Fast and Furious, like _x000D_
on National Security Letters, and that kind of work."
2926646,2926645,2926647,19244,3,"    Yes, and I think Gene made such an _x000D_
excellent point, that not only do we see dollar returns, but we _x000D_
see returns in better services. The point that Joni made about _x000D_
veterans, it is not just about dollars. This is livelihood._x000D_
    And, Colonel Crumpacker, when I started on this Committee, _x000D_
we were tearing our hair out because there was an attitude, we _x000D_
believed, about GAO at Homeland Security that was not very _x000D_
conducive to resolving a lot of the controversy, and with your _x000D_
presentation today, we are seeing a pretty positive attitude, _x000D_
seeing the numbers go down. I think that is really a step in _x000D_
the right direction, so I want to applaud the effort of _x000D_
Homeland Security in stepping up and actually being responsive."
2926647,2926646,2926648,19244,3,"    Thank you, Senator."
2926648,2926647,2926649,19244,3,"    I think that is a great step forward and _x000D_
real progress._x000D_
    With that, I will yield the floor."
2926649,2926648,2926650,19244,3,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I will ask a few questions as well, and then we are just _x000D_
going to open up the microphone, and we will have open dialogue _x000D_
here around the table._x000D_
    Gene, talk to me a little bit more about the follow up _x000D_
process with Congress. As you mentioned before, this is a 40-_x000D_
year process that has been in place, and it needs a review. So _x000D_
talk about the rest of the details on that."
2926650,2926649,2926651,19244,3,"    Yes. Well, first, we have a wide footprint _x000D_
across the Congress. Last year, about 97 percent of the _x000D_
committees and 66 percent of the subcommittees requested GAO _x000D_
work. And some of that requested work is actually right on _x000D_
following up on our recommendations on previous reports. So _x000D_
that dialogue goes on all the time._x000D_
    We are heavily involved with the appropriations bill every _x000D_
year. Since it is a vehicle that goes through every year in _x000D_
both the Appropriations Committees and the subcommittees work _x000D_
with them on open recommendations and recommendations things _x000D_
the agencies have not agreed to and that still need to be _x000D_
implemented. We encourage them to put something in statute, and _x000D_
that works. For example, where there is a need for an agency _x000D_
plan, say, to improve an IT project, the committees will _x000D_
withhold the money until agencies implement our _x000D_
recommendations._x000D_
    This happened for Defense spending. For example, we found _x000D_
that the Department of Defense was using a proliferation of _x000D_
camouflage across all the different services. And not only was _x000D_
it wasteful from a dollars standpoint, but it had safety _x000D_
implications because you cannot operate well in joint _x000D_
environment having different camouflage patterns. You are _x000D_
supposed to be disguised from the enemy, not from yourselves. _x000D_
And so DOD agreed with our recommendations, but Congress _x000D_
mandated in the national defense authorization bill that they _x000D_
have a uniform approach to that issue. So that is just one _x000D_
minor example of Congress acting to reinforce our _x000D_
recommendations over time._x000D_
    Now, the 60-day response is something that has been in _x000D_
statute for 40 years, and regularly these letters go to _x000D_
committees. I am not sure, quite frankly, what all the _x000D_
committees do with the letters that they receive. We get them, _x000D_
too. We follow up. In some committees we have regular dialogue _x000D_
on these. Some others we may not have the same level of _x000D_
attention. Because I am not sure, I want to look at it _x000D_
systematically across the various committees in the Congress, _x000D_
and we plan to do that. And once we have that done, we will _x000D_
share the results with this Committee and see if there are any _x000D_
changes that need to be made in statute or in practice._x000D_
    I want to look at this, too--what the quality of the _x000D_
responses are from the agencies in the 60-day letters. So I _x000D_
want to look at whether or not they are being clear on whether _x000D_
they are going to implement our recommendations._x000D_
    Regarding Senator Tester's question earlier about DOD, I _x000D_
also want to make sure, too, ultimately that they will _x000D_
implement the recommendations. But the pace at which they are _x000D_
going about this in many cases is too slow to realize the full _x000D_
benefit. So it is not only whether they are going to eventually _x000D_
implement recommendations, but it is the pace at which they are _x000D_
implementing them, where Congress can be very helpful. We _x000D_
expect that the prioritization of the recommendations could be _x000D_
helpful too."
2926651,2926650,2926652,19244,3,"    Is it your suspicion, because of the, let _x000D_
us say, tenacity of the infrastructure there and bureaucracy at _x000D_
DOD that it tends to slow down the process and takes long to _x000D_
get anything done? Or is it the decision whether they are going _x000D_
to do it or not?"
2926652,2926651,2926653,19244,3,"    I think sometimes the decision to implement a _x000D_
recommendation may not be with the level of intensity that we _x000D_
would like to see. It is like, DOD says, it is a good idea, we _x000D_
will get around to it when we can. Definitely resource issues _x000D_
also come into play._x000D_
    I am very concerned--one of the reasons I sent the letters _x000D_
to the heads of the departments and agencies now is that we are _x000D_
going to have a transition in administrations. There is a huge _x000D_
potential--and I have seen this happen over the years; it does _x000D_
not matter what administration it is--where there will be a _x000D_
lull in the activities of the individual departments and _x000D_
agencies. They will not know, what the new priorities are going _x000D_
to be of the new administration. It is an opportunity, if they _x000D_
do not really believe fully in implementing the _x000D_
recommendations, to slow things down until they get new _x000D_
priorities._x000D_
    So there is a lot of lost momentum that occurs in a change _x000D_
in administration, and the Congress needs to be helpful. I try _x000D_
to do what I can because we have a lot of continuity in GAO. I _x000D_
have a 15-year term, so I see administrations come and go. And _x000D_
I try to focus on making sure they maintain good progress on _x000D_
initiatives they began but also attend to things that have not _x000D_
been addressed before. But I always worry about the loss of _x000D_
momentum during these changes in administration."
2926653,2926652,2926654,19244,3,"    OK. Let me just open this up for open _x000D_
dialogue as well. Mr. Horowitz, let me ask you a question. How _x000D_
do you all share ideas. As you mentioned, CIGIE is a fairly new _x000D_
organization, so how are the Inspectors General sharing ideas, _x000D_
``This is what we do, this has been effective,'' and not only _x000D_
methods of investigation but places to go look and things to do _x000D_
that become a frequent gold mine for efficiencies within _x000D_
agencies?"
2926654,2926653,2926655,19244,3,"    We have organized ourselves not only in _x000D_
monthly meetings to get together to talk about issues we are _x000D_
seeing and we need to address, but we have broken down our _x000D_
structures by committee consistent with the kind of work we do. _x000D_
So there is an audit committee, an investigations committee, _x000D_
evaluations and inspections committee, an IT committee. Those _x000D_
are the committees that get together and talk about what are _x000D_
the auditors seeing, what are we finding, what are the agents _x000D_
seeing when they are doing their work; evaluators and _x000D_
inspectors, same thing; on the IT side, cyber related, what are _x000D_
we seeing there?_x000D_
    They then generate proposals and ideas that the larger _x000D_
community then discusses on what should we jointly do. That led _x000D_
to our cloud computing review last year, which was a very _x000D_
useful and I think important review. We are undertaking one now _x000D_
on cyber-related issues as well, trying to think about these _x000D_
issues across the community. But we could be doing more in this _x000D_
regard, and that is one of the reasons we have sought a direct _x000D_
appropriation for several years now because there could be more _x000D_
we are doing across 72 IGs and what we are learning and seeing _x000D_
and sharing that. But we need to upgrade our IT systems. We _x000D_
need staffing to do that._x000D_
    We have about 20 staff total for CIGIE. Many of them are _x000D_
detailees because we do not have the direct appropriation, _x000D_
which means we do not know year to year what the pass-through _x000D_
funding is going to be, which has been largely the mechanism we _x000D_
have had over the last several years._x000D_
    So the President's budget does not include money directly _x000D_
for us, but for the prior several years, they have divided up _x000D_
through 17 IGs to see if they get funding. Those that get _x000D_
funding--not all of them do--then pass the money through to the _x000D_
CIGIE. We have asked for, for example, $6 to $7 million over _x000D_
the last several years, and in the pass-through process have _x000D_
gotten $1 to $4 million. That is no way--we cannot run an _x000D_
organization and do some of the things that make complete sense _x000D_
to do when we do not know how much money we are getting year to _x000D_
year because we cannot hire staff in that way. We can get _x000D_
detailees, but that means people are just coming and going, and _x000D_
we do not have the kind of consistency that you need to do _x000D_
these kind of efforts."
2926655,2926654,2926656,19244,3,"    It just kind of boggles my mind that, _x000D_
from somebody who used to run a State agency and when the State _x000D_
auditor gave me a recommendation, man, we turned Heaven and _x000D_
Earth to get it done, because we knew there was going to be _x000D_
political accountability, accountability and oversight _x000D_
committees in the State legislature. We did not always agree _x000D_
with what the State auditor told us, but we certainly came to _x000D_
terms and said, ``Let us get this done. Let us get the review _x000D_
done.''_x000D_
    And so I think that part of this is trying to change the _x000D_
dynamic of what seems to be maybe a little bit too cavalier of _x000D_
an attitude that, ``Well, it is just those guys,'' ``It might _x000D_
be a bad hearing on the Hill, but everybody will forget about _x000D_
it, and we will just go about our life the way we have always _x000D_
gone about our life.''_x000D_
    How do we change that attitude? Colonel, I want to talk to _x000D_
you, because I think we have--and I think Gene would agree--_x000D_
seen an attitude change at DHS. What kinds of things internally _x000D_
did you do to really make the supervisors and everybody there _x000D_
aware that these are problems, we do not want to go to the Hill _x000D_
anymore and say we are on high-risk and doing nothing about it, _x000D_
let us change attitude, let us work collaboratively and _x000D_
cooperatively with GAO? And how can we kind of take your _x000D_
experience and expand on it in other agencies?"
2926656,2926655,2926657,19244,3,"    So with us at DHS, it, quite frankly, _x000D_
started with the senior most leadership in the Department, from _x000D_
the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the General Counsel, and _x000D_
the Under Secretary for Management. If you go back to each of _x000D_
their confirmation hearings, this type of issue was discussed _x000D_
at the hearings, and they all went on record and committed to _x000D_
helping grow and robust up the new and improved process that we _x000D_
had. And that cascaded down through the Department. They have _x000D_
been tremendously supportive of my office. We are allowed to _x000D_
reach out and touch anyone anywhere within the Department at _x000D_
any time to dialogue and engage on GAO and OIG audit activity."
2926657,2926656,2926658,19244,3,"    So you think the accountability point _x000D_
really was when it reached a level here where we are sitting _x000D_
across from the nominee saying, ``Here is your audit report. _x000D_
What are going to do about it?''"
2926658,2926657,2926659,19244,3,"    Well, I think our leadership wanted to do _x000D_
the right thing and would have done it regardless. But _x000D_
certainly when it is on record at a confirmation hearing and _x000D_
they have taken that to heart and followed through, they have _x000D_
cascaded it down. The Comptroller General talked about _x000D_
recommendations hopefully being closed within 4 years. Our goal _x000D_
at DHS is to close them within 2 years, 24 months, and we track _x000D_
and monitor that all the time, to include bimonthly briefings _x000D_
to the Deputy Secretary and other senior leaders, including the _x000D_
Under Secretary for Management and the General Counsel."
2926659,2926658,2926660,19244,3,"    Not to belabor this, but, Gene, that _x000D_
might be the point of getting that kind of information on what _x000D_
is open so we do not see a lapse as we transition and make it _x000D_
part of that process, make it part of the expectation that when _x000D_
you come, you are going to take these recommendations _x000D_
seriously, and if you do not agree with them, then we can have _x000D_
that debate. But if you do agree with them, then what is the _x000D_
timeframe?_x000D_
    And so I think, having a high-profile evaluation here on _x000D_
these kinds of recommendations and having your priority list _x000D_
and having those letters is going to be useful in the _x000D_
transition."
2926660,2926659,2926661,19244,3,"    Yes, there are two points on this._x000D_
    One, we have done for this Committee in the past a set of _x000D_
questions that could be asked during nomination hearings. _x000D_
Senator Voinovich was involved in this before. We can dust that _x000D_
off and update it and provide that to you as well. This was _x000D_
made broadly available from this Committee to all the other _x000D_
committees that hold confirmation hearings on new appointees._x000D_
    Second, under the Presidential Transition Act, GAO has a _x000D_
responsibility to be a source of information to incoming _x000D_
administrations. So last time, in 2008, we produced a website _x000D_
with all the key issues that we thought by department and _x000D_
agency, on a cross-cutting basis and priority recommendations _x000D_
for the incoming administration to use. That was made available _x000D_
to the Congress and the public all at the same time. We did _x000D_
that 2 days after there was a President-elect determination, so _x000D_
we are positioning ourselves to do the same thing next time _x000D_
around._x000D_
    Now, while I have the floor, there is one correction I need _x000D_
to make, that I think is significant. The 60-day letters that _x000D_
we have been talking about, by law they come to this Committee, _x000D_
GAO's oversight committee in the House and the Appropriations _x000D_
Committees. They do not go, my team tells me, to the _x000D_
authorizing committees, as Senator Tester mentioned. So I want _x000D_
to correct that answer, but also, I think that is an _x000D_
opportunity for changing the law. I think they need to go to _x000D_
the authorizing committees."
2926661,2926660,2926662,19244,3,"    Or it should be standard practice that _x000D_
this Committee shares it with the authorizing committee."
2926662,2926661,2926663,19244,3,"    Yes, so we will take that and then build upon _x000D_
any other suggestions in our reexamination. But I think that _x000D_
change should be made."
2926663,2926662,2926664,19244,3,"    Can I ask a follow up question as well on _x000D_
DHS? Some of the high-risk areas that have come up, the Federal _x000D_
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) _x000D_
and the administrative costs, that was one of those areas that _x000D_
for 10 years, there was 13 percent administrative costs to be _x000D_
able to run the Disaster Relief Fund. Tell me where that is and _x000D_
what the conversation is like, and how do you resolve that? So _x000D_
as you are walking through, that is a big one. That is billions _x000D_
of dollars. How does that kind of thing get resolved?"
2926664,2926663,2926665,19244,3,"    Well, there was an audit report this year, _x000D_
which we responded to, and it began with our program officials _x000D_
and subject matter experts specifically concurring or non-_x000D_
concurring with each recommendation, and I believe, as I _x000D_
recall, they concurred with all of them. And then we told GAO _x000D_
which office within FEMA or elsewhere is going to take the _x000D_
action, what are they going to do and when is it going to be _x000D_
done. And, generally speaking, when we respond to any audit _x000D_
report, GAO or OIG, our rules of engagement, if you will, _x000D_
within DHS are that you have an estimated completion date, and _x000D_
it is generally OK to have that up to 12 months from the date _x000D_
the report is issued. If it is going to go beyond 12 months, we _x000D_
ask the program officials to provide us interim milestones, _x000D_
which we track and monitor._x000D_
    On the Disaster Relief Fund administrative costs, that was _x000D_
also a duplication/overlap issue that came out this year, in _x000D_
2015, and so that is new for us in the duplication/overlap, and _x000D_
that is a work still in progress. We could certainly get back _x000D_
to you with details\1\ on what is being done to address that._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ Mr. Crumpacker response to Senator Lankford's question appears _x000D_
in the Appendix on page 95._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926665,2926664,2926666,19244,3,"    Is that an assumption that that is a 2-_x000D_
year project then? As you mentioned, it is 4 years that you _x000D_
consider it open, but for you, you really try to get this done _x000D_
in 2 years."
2926666,2926665,2926667,19244,3,"    On the recommendations-related audit _x000D_
reports our goal is to close them all within 24 months of _x000D_
issuance. On the duplication and overlap, those are not _x000D_
recommendations per se. We call them ``actions.'' We track and _x000D_
monitor those separately. Many of those actions are the same as _x000D_
the recommendations in the underlying supporting audit reports, _x000D_
but I would have to look at those specifically."
2926667,2926666,2926668,19244,3,"    And when you have other agencies engaged _x000D_
in this, and this is what Gene Dodaro was mentioning before _x000D_
about when it is multi-agency it gets tougher, what happens? _x000D_
Give us an example of a multi-agency issue that you will have, _x000D_
and how does the process work with OMB to be able to help _x000D_
resolve the issues where there is duplication between agencies _x000D_
or there is overlap there."
2926668,2926667,2926669,19244,3,"    So I would not be able to speak to what _x000D_
might or might not go on at OMB. Typically, that would be _x000D_
handled by----"
2926669,2926668,2926670,19244,3,"    I am just talking from your side of it, _x000D_
what communication you receive from OMB and how that works and _x000D_
how they coordinate with you."
2926670,2926669,2926671,19244,3,"    And that communication would typically go _x000D_
directly to the program officials."
2926671,2926670,2926672,19244,3,    OK.
2926672,2926671,2926673,19244,3,    Our office is not involved in that.
2926673,2926672,2926674,19244,3,"    So you work directly with GAO and with _x000D_
the OIG, but not necessarily with OMB, in implementing some of _x000D_
their recommendations if it is multi-agency."
2926674,2926673,2926675,19244,3,"    That is correct. What we do with regard to _x000D_
a nexus to OMB is that we do track and monitor and ensure the _x000D_
accomplishment of the 60-day letters that are supposed to be _x000D_
sent to OMB and the Congress, and so we ensure that those are _x000D_
going in in a timely manner. DHS, as you can see in the written _x000D_
statement, I think it was 2008. It took us, quite frankly, 18 _x000D_
and a half months to get a 60-day letter out. The last 2 or 3 _x000D_
years, we have been down to 62, 63 days. 2016 is going to be _x000D_
the year that for the first time ever we get down below that _x000D_
60-day----"
2926675,2926674,2926676,19244,3,    Fifty-nine days. [Laughter.]
2926676,2926675,2926677,19244,3,"    Yes, sir."
2926677,2926676,2926678,19244,3,"    Can I ask another one lingering--and, _x000D_
Senator Portman, just jump in any time. We are on our second _x000D_
round, and it is a more open conversation here. But one other _x000D_
question just about Fast and Furious. Mr. Horowitz, you brought _x000D_
that up. Obviously, that is a long, lingering issue with a lot _x000D_
of recommendations that are now sitting out there. It is 6 _x000D_
years at this point on Fast and Furious. Tell me where that _x000D_
status is, recommendations, and the implementation of that."
2926678,2926677,2926679,19244,3,"    So while the issues for Fast and Furious were _x000D_
back in the 2009-10 period, our report was 2012. So we are _x000D_
finishing up our follow up review of where those _x000D_
recommendations remain 3 years later so that we can decide _x000D_
whether they are now closed--whether they can be closed. And we _x000D_
are pretty near finalizing that and getting it here to the _x000D_
Hill, I think, very soon. And that is one of the ways, by the _x000D_
way, that we prioritize. We do not internally prioritize our _x000D_
open recommendations. We usually issue an aging report in _x000D_
essence to this Committee and to the leadership. We prioritize _x000D_
by doing follow ups on the most significant issues that we have _x000D_
and doing a review within 2 or 3 years usually to see where _x000D_
that is, a more thorough follow up review than perhaps just _x000D_
getting their paperwork, and reviewing what the Department is _x000D_
submitting to us. We are actually out there interviewing people _x000D_
and talking to people."
2926679,2926678,2926680,19244,3,    OK. Senator Portman.
2926680,2926679,2926681,19244,3,"    Well, first, thanks very much to both of _x000D_
you for holding the hearing and, more importantly, this _x000D_
Subcommittee has been more active than perhaps Subcommittees _x000D_
have been in the past on the issue of oversight and _x000D_
specifically how you take the IG work and the GAO work and _x000D_
track it and implement it as appropriate. So I appreciate them _x000D_
spending the time and effort on this._x000D_
    I think this is a time when we should all be doubling down _x000D_
on how to make government work more efficiently. We have this _x000D_
unsustainable debt and deficit, and one place to have some _x000D_
savings is, of course, with regard to more efficient _x000D_
government. And so I rely on the GAO reports and the IG reports _x000D_
and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. As you know, _x000D_
that is one of our great sources of information. But there are _x000D_
some broader things that I think can and should be done by the _x000D_
full Committee, too, and so this is a great way for us to _x000D_
understand whether we are tracking this or not._x000D_
    I am sorry I got here a little late. There is a lot going _x000D_
on right now with the omnibus and the extenders package, and I _x000D_
was in a meeting on that extenders issue._x000D_
    I guess my question would be more generally about the _x000D_
process. My understanding is that when you all at GAO, Gene, _x000D_
issue a report that the agency head has a requirement to send _x000D_
that report to us within a certain period of time and that you _x000D_
have indicated you might look at that process, and I do not _x000D_
know how my colleagues Senator Heitkamp and Senator Lankford _x000D_
feel about this, but it seems to me there could be a more _x000D_
transparent way for us to get those reports and to get some _x000D_
agency reaction to those reports. But maybe you have already _x000D_
talked about this this morning. If you have, I apologize, but _x000D_
what is your proposal about how to make that system work _x000D_
better?"
2926681,2926680,2926682,19244,3,"    Well, first of all, I would like to look to see _x000D_
whether the agencies are responding in a timely manner 60 days _x000D_
or not. I am not sure we have a systemic picture across _x000D_
government on that issue. We talked about making sure the _x000D_
letters now go to the authorizing committees as well as the _x000D_
oversight and the appropriation committees, so that is a change _x000D_
I would propose that we make in the future._x000D_
    Second would be the transparency you mentioned. I want to _x000D_
evaluate the quality of their responses whether the agencies _x000D_
are actually giving good responses to the Congress. I also want _x000D_
to then evaluate standard practices in GAO for reviewing those _x000D_
letters we will then engage in a dialogue with the committees _x000D_
regarding their perspective on the agency response letter._x000D_
    So I think we could perhaps look at ways where this could _x000D_
be more transparent----"
2926682,2926681,2926683,19244,3,"    Are you undertaking that process already _x000D_
to look at the system and see whether it is working?"
2926683,2926682,2926684,19244,3,"    We have not started yet. I plan to start--quite _x000D_
frankly, the genesis of this hearing prompted me to think about _x000D_
it."
2926684,2926683,2926685,19244,3,    OK.
2926685,2926684,2926686,19244,3,"    So I would credit this hearing as a means of _x000D_
getting us started on that process."
2926686,2926685,2926687,19244,3,"    I for one would like to encourage you to _x000D_
do it, and I am sure that Chairman Lankford and Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp would also like to be part of that. But I think that _x000D_
is really an interesting opportunity for us to at least get the _x000D_
good work that is being done used in a more effective way, to _x000D_
put it in the agency's hands to have to react to it and to get _x000D_
it to us in a way that makes more sense to actually follow _x000D_
through and hold people accountable._x000D_
    The other question I would have, I guess, is just what your _x000D_
relationship is like with your departments. Mr. Crumpacker, you _x000D_
talked a little about how your relationship with your DHS _x000D_
senior officials is positive. There is a transparent _x000D_
relationship; they look to you to provide them information. Is _x000D_
that accurate? Do you feel like you have a good relationship?"
2926687,2926686,2926688,19244,3,"    Absolutely, yes, sir. I have a good _x000D_
relationship within the Department with senior leadership at _x000D_
all levels, and I have a good relationship outside of the _x000D_
Department with both GAO and the OIG. As an example, with GAO, _x000D_
we have a quarterly coordination senior leadership meeting that _x000D_
has happened--I cannot remember when it started, at least 6 _x000D_
years ago. Every quarter we meet with George Scott, the _x000D_
Managing Director for Homeland Security and Justice Issues, on _x000D_
the DHS side. That meeting is chaired by the Under Secretary _x000D_
for Management and the General Counsel. So that is the type of _x000D_
ongoing engagement, an example of the type of ongoing _x000D_
engagement that we have to maintain and continue to build our _x000D_
relationships."
2926688,2926687,2926689,19244,3,    Would the IG agree with you?
2926689,2926688,2926690,19244,3,"    Yes, sir. As a matter of fact, in my _x000D_
written statement there is a quote from Mr. Roth where he _x000D_
recently told me that--if I could just turn to it, he said: _x000D_
``That your office even exists is a testament that DHS has a _x000D_
mature and constructive attitude toward what we do.'' So I do _x000D_
believe he would agree."
2926690,2926689,2926691,19244,3,"    All right. Now let us turn to Mr. _x000D_
Horowitz. Do you think your office enjoys a similar _x000D_
relationship with the Department of Justice leadership?"
2926691,2926690,2926692,19244,3,"    I do. We have had traditionally a very strong _x000D_
relationship with the Department's Justice Management Division, _x000D_
who is responsible for following these up. I think one of the _x000D_
things that we have done to effect more change at the _x000D_
Department is within the last 2 years send to the Attorney _x000D_
General and the Deputy Attorney General, as well as to the _x000D_
Congress, our complete list of open recommendations, because _x000D_
what we were finding is, among the dozens of components at the _x000D_
Justice Department, some were being more responsive than _x000D_
others. And the Justice Management Division, no matter how much _x000D_
they wanted to help, they are one of those components among _x000D_
many and having the leadership involved could perhaps move this _x000D_
process along further. And the Deputy Attorney General's office _x000D_
has been very helpful in that regard and just this month has _x000D_
put now in place a new system, a mechanism, and is advising the _x000D_
components across the Department to work with Justice _x000D_
Management Division auditors to move these along. So that has _x000D_
been helpful, and we are hoping to see more movement now."
2926692,2926691,2926693,19244,3,"    How about your access to sensitive _x000D_
information? You have expressed concern in the past of not _x000D_
having access to everything that you would like in terms of _x000D_
sensitive issues."
2926693,2926692,2926694,19244,3,"    There remain issues in not only the Justice _x000D_
Department but across all IG offices following up on the Office _x000D_
of Legal Counsel opinion that interpreted the IG statute, _x000D_
looked at the IG statute, and it is unclear at this point _x000D_
whether the provision in Section 6(a) of the IG Act regarding _x000D_
all records and access to all records for IGs indeed authorizes _x000D_
us to have access to all records in the hundreds, if not _x000D_
thousands of statutes that have limitations on them on access._x000D_
    In connection with our work, we do not have independent _x000D_
access anymore to grand jury, wiretap, or credit information at _x000D_
the Department. The Department decides whether as a legal _x000D_
matter we are entitled to those records, and that is not _x000D_
consistent with, in our view, independent oversight."
2926694,2926693,2926695,19244,3,"    Would you be willing to give us your _x000D_
recommendations as to how the statute could be clarified?"
2926695,2926694,2926696,19244,3,"    I would, and I would say, Senator, that the _x000D_
proposal that I think is pending to address this on the IG _x000D_
Empowerment Act, which this Committee already approved, would _x000D_
add the language that I think would resolve the issue for us. _x000D_
We are hopeful that is, in fact, the language that is adopted _x000D_
by----"
2926696,2926695,2926697,19244,3,"    That would solve the problem, you think, _x000D_
in the Empowerment Act?"
2926697,2926696,2926698,19244,3,"    That would solve the problem. It would make _x000D_
clear that unless Congress explicitly said IGs should not get _x000D_
certain records, the default is Congress intended the IGs to _x000D_
get the records. Right now we are operating essentially on the _x000D_
reverse proposition."
2926698,2926697,2926699,19244,3,"    And, Gene, is there any legislative help _x000D_
that you think you need in order to make this system work _x000D_
better of transmitting reports to this Committee and to the _x000D_
Congress?"
2926699,2926698,2926700,19244,3,"    I think that the recommendations I made earlier _x000D_
about making sure the reports go to the authorizing committees _x000D_
is the one I would cite right now."
2926700,2926699,2926701,19244,3,"    Does that require statutory change, do you _x000D_
think?"
2926701,2926700,2926702,19244,3,"    Yes. In the meantime, what we can do is make _x000D_
sure when we get them, we give them to the authorizing _x000D_
committees. But that is not an efficient way to do it. It would _x000D_
be better if the agencies did it as well."
2926702,2926701,2926703,19244,3,"    With their input, preferably."
2926703,2926702,2926704,19244,3,    Yes.
2926704,2926703,2926705,19244,3,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2926705,2926704,2926706,19244,3,"    Can I just run down--I have been trying _x000D_
to keep a kind of running list of ideas and issues here as we _x000D_
look at adding this kind of good governance piece, and you are _x000D_
absolutely a foundational need for good government. There is no _x000D_
doubt about it. But if nobody wants to build on that, we do not _x000D_
get the results that we need._x000D_
    So we are talking, Gene, about the 60-day letters. You are _x000D_
going to look to see if there is a quality response kind of _x000D_
indication, or if they are just--the night before it is due, _x000D_
throwing something together as opposed to actually having a _x000D_
plan for implementation. Then legislation on authorizing _x000D_
committees, looking at transparency, increasing the _x000D_
transparency of the 60-day letters. And then taking a look at _x000D_
standard practices on how you deal with them. And some of those _x000D_
are administrative, and some of those are legislative, and we _x000D_
will have to sort through that._x000D_
    We have the IG Empowerment Act that absolutely needs to be _x000D_
done if the IGs are going to be our partners that they need to _x000D_
be. We have heard today a specific problem with the Department _x000D_
of Health and Human Services, access to the database for cross-_x000D_
referencing any kind of fraud or failure to basically do the _x000D_
double-check that we need to do to make sure that people are _x000D_
not getting paid who are not statutorily qualified to be paid._x000D_
    Then looking at the additional resources, and that is _x000D_
something that we need to share with our colleagues. Senator _x000D_
Tester is on Appropriations. Senator Lankford is on _x000D_
Appropriations. That is helpful to bring that message back._x000D_
    But I honestly believe that as we have seen the benefit of _x000D_
this collaboration across agencies that GAO is able to bring as _x000D_
a result of their centralized mission, that we need to do _x000D_
something like that--maybe not centralize the IGs, but _x000D_
definitely create a database and create the resources that we _x000D_
need. And then, obviously, the authorizing committee._x000D_
    What did I miss here?"
2926706,2926705,2926707,19244,3,"    No, I think you got everything. The human _x000D_
resource base, the new hire database----"
2926707,2926706,2926708,19244,3,    Yes.
2926708,2926707,2926709,19244,3,"    But that is a pretty good list. I do not think _x000D_
you missed anything."
2926709,2926708,2926710,19244,3,"    The one thing I want to talk a little bit _x000D_
about is, as we now go into tax season again, the problems that _x000D_
we have with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database and _x000D_
with inappropriate refunds. Everybody wants to get their refund _x000D_
quickly. That is the system that we have now designed. As a _x000D_
former tax commissioner, if we got your refund within a month, _x000D_
people were thrilled. That now would be seen as, my goodness, I _x000D_
want it tomorrow kind of thing. Obviously, that desire to get _x000D_
people back their refund has created a situation where we may _x000D_
not be doing the kind of double-check that we need to do before _x000D_
those refunds go out. And I know that is not the purpose of _x000D_
this hearing, but I am concerned as we go into this tax season _x000D_
that we are better prepared than we were last tax season to _x000D_
catch fraud and abuse of that refund system."
2926710,2926709,2926711,19244,3,"    This is an area--that fits with this hearing. _x000D_
We have open recommendations that require a statutory change by _x000D_
the Congress that we think is necessary to fix this problem._x000D_
    No. 1, you need to accelerate the dates for W-2 filings. _x000D_
Right now the IRS does not get the W-2 information to match, _x000D_
from the employers until April. And by then it is too late. The _x000D_
crooks file early, and they are filing using identity theft, _x000D_
and that is a big vulnerability, and IRS is limited in their _x000D_
ability to obtain information to prevent it. This would also _x000D_
help in other areas in terms of, wage withholding for Social _x000D_
Security to have the W-2 information earlier. So that is No. 1._x000D_
    No. 2, we think Congress ought to give IRS the authority to _x000D_
regulate paid tax preparers. A lot of returns are prepared by _x000D_
paid tax preparers. IRS has done an analysis. A significant _x000D_
number of those returns have inappropriate advice, for example _x000D_
claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). We did an _x000D_
undercover investigation where we sent people out to 19 paid _x000D_
tax preparers, and in only 2 cases did we get the correct _x000D_
answer for the situation that we had in terms of the filing _x000D_
situation of our undercover teams. And we looked at the data _x000D_
that IRS had submitted, and over 60 percent of the returns, our _x000D_
estimate is--and they confirmed it--prepared by paid tax _x000D_
preparers had errors in them._x000D_
    So IRS tried to regulate prepares based on these concerns. _x000D_
This is a case where the agency moved quickly on our _x000D_
recommendation, but then IRS was sued. And the courts _x000D_
determined they did not have the authority to regulate in this _x000D_
are and so Congress needs to act in order to----"
2926711,2926710,2926712,19244,3,"    So the question I would have with that, _x000D_
and I have had this conversation with the IRS as well on it, is _x000D_
the carrot-stick approach here. They used the stick heavily. _x000D_
The reverse of that is to say you can only do fast returns and _x000D_
be listed as a paid preparer that actually has a--who basically _x000D_
gets in the fast lane, the HOV lane of returns if you are _x000D_
certified. If you are not certified, your returns take a month _x000D_
to get back. If you are certified, it takes a week to get back. _x000D_
Every one of these paid preparers says they can get it turned _x000D_
around fast. They will all go through the certification if they _x000D_
get that access to it._x000D_
    Do they have access to do that right now, or would that _x000D_
take legislative action?"
2926712,2926711,2926713,19244,3,"    I will have to take a look at it. My initial _x000D_
response, pending a more detailed response, would be they would _x000D_
need to have legislation in order to do it.\1\_x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ Mr. Dodaro response to Senator Lankford's question appears in _x000D_
the Appendix on page 98._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2926713,2926712,2926714,19244,3,    OK.
2926714,2926713,2926715,19244,3,"    We looked at Oregon that regulates tax _x000D_
preparers, has for a number of years, we did an analysis, and _x000D_
we found that you have a 72-percent higher rate of accuracy in _x000D_
tax returns filed in Oregon than you do anywhere else in the _x000D_
country. We always call our States the ``laboratories of good _x000D_
government.'' It has been proven to be effective in Oregon, and _x000D_
I think the IRS could do it._x000D_
    Now, how they exercise the authority and go through due _x000D_
process for a carrot-stick approach or a different, maybe _x000D_
tiered approach would be up to them. But I think it would be _x000D_
better if the Congress gave them the authority and had them _x000D_
develop a proposal for Congress on how they would exercise the _x000D_
new regulatory authority. The proposal could include benefits _x000D_
and costs and how to avoid any downsides of overregulation."
2926715,2926714,2926716,19244,3,"    We have a little opportunity in the _x000D_
extenders package to do something for enrolled agents, _x000D_
something that has been in the mix for, I think 12 years now, _x000D_
and it would help because these enrolled agents do have this _x000D_
expertise and the certification process they have to go _x000D_
through, or they cannot advertise it. To me it is crazy. So _x000D_
that is a small way to help. That is not necessarily going to _x000D_
answer all of the questions that you have raised, but to have _x000D_
people who have professional certifications in this area being _x000D_
able to tell people that if you come to us, you are going to _x000D_
get a better, more accurate return in, I think that is helpful._x000D_
    Could I ask a question about the Congressional Review Act? _x000D_
Again, this may have come up earlier, but it is not directly _x000D_
related to these reports, but it is related to GAO. And you _x000D_
know that it was for a while true that when a Federal agency _x000D_
sends final rules to Congress, they also send them to GAO _x000D_
before the rules can take effect, and GAO used to keep track of _x000D_
all those covered rules that are being submitted and would _x000D_
notify OMB of any missing rules. And in November 2011, my _x000D_
understanding is GAO stopped checking the Federal Register and _x000D_
stopped notifying OMB of these missing rules. According to the _x000D_
Administrative Conference, once GAO reduced the check of the _x000D_
Federal Register, stopped doing this process, the number of _x000D_
rules in the GAO database fell sharply._x000D_
    Can you explain why GAO stopped keeping track of rules _x000D_
being submitted to Congress and whether you think it would be _x000D_
worthwhile to endeavor to resume that?"
2926716,2926715,2926717,19244,3,"    We are still carrying out our statutory _x000D_
responsibilities. I will have to get back to you with an answer _x000D_
on that. I know this has come up before. I have looked into it. _x000D_
I was satisfied that we had a good reason but I cannot remember _x000D_
it off the top of my head. And I do not have anybody here who _x000D_
can give me an answer to that. But I will get you an answer by _x000D_
the end of the day."
2926717,2926716,2926718,19244,3,"    Well, that would be helpful. When I was at _x000D_
OMB, it was done, and I am told, again, by the Administrative _x000D_
Conference folks that that is no longer the case. So we would _x000D_
love to hear from you on that."
2926718,2926717,2926719,19244,3,    Sure.
2926719,2926718,2926720,19244,3,"    Another potential legislative activity we _x000D_
could undertake here to help to get a better sense of what the _x000D_
rules are and just more transparency to Congress."
2926720,2926719,2926721,19244,3,"    And as I am recalling it now, I think it is a _x000D_
resource issue as well. So we will let you know about that as _x000D_
well."
2926721,2926720,2926722,19244,3,"    All right. Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2926722,2926721,2926723,19244,3,"    Mr. Horowitz, could I ask you a question _x000D_
just about people and what I have found in visiting with many _x000D_
of the agencies and the individuals who work in the agencies? _x000D_
They are some of the most frustrated people about the work of _x000D_
the agency because they see the bureaucracy and they see the _x000D_
inefficiencies, and it seems like they have very few places to _x000D_
be able to get that out. Can you talk a little bit about _x000D_
whistleblowers and their own protection and then the _x000D_
opportunity for not just whistleblowers but just suggestions _x000D_
and ideas? And are the IGs watching for that and watching for _x000D_
how are good ideas rising out of the employees in these _x000D_
agencies? Is that something they regularly check? And if so, _x000D_
how are we managing some of the whistleblowers and some of the _x000D_
ideas and suggestions?"
2926723,2926722,2926724,19244,3,"    We do follow that, and one of the actions _x000D_
that IGs took in light of the Whistleblower Act adopted 2 years _x000D_
ago by Congress, the whistleblowers enhancements----"
2926724,2926723,2926725,19244,3,"    Right. We had additional protections that _x000D_
we had a markup on yesterday dealing with the same thing."
2926725,2926724,2926726,19244,3,"    And we all have now ombudsmen throughout the _x000D_
OIG community. We have created in CIGIE a working group among _x000D_
the ombuds to get together to talk about the commonality of _x000D_
issues that we face across the IG community on whistleblower _x000D_
issues. We have been very engaged with the Office of Special _x000D_
Counsel (OSC) to make sure we understand what they are seeing, _x000D_
because they obviously have the best picture into retaliation _x000D_
issues that come to whistleblowers, and it is something that I _x000D_
have done particularly within my own agency, the Justice _x000D_
Department, to make sure that we are being, as an OIG, more _x000D_
responsive and appropriately responsive to whistleblowers and _x000D_
that we get training across the Justice Department on _x000D_
whistleblower issues._x000D_
    We have authority on the Federal Bureau of Investigations _x000D_
(FBI) whistleblower retaliation. That comes to us as an OIG. It _x000D_
does not go to OSC. So we have a special interest in these _x000D_
issues for that reason. One of the messages that I have _x000D_
certainly tried to get out--I know my colleagues in the IG _x000D_
community have tried to get out--is that we have 14,000 staff _x000D_
throughout the 72 OIGs. We know a lot about what is going on in _x000D_
the agencies we oversee. But the real eyes and ears of the _x000D_
organization are the people who work day in, day out at the _x000D_
agency. They know far more than we ever will know, and they are _x000D_
the ones we need to come to us with issues they are seeing if _x000D_
they are not getting resolved by their supervisors, their _x000D_
managers, their boss' bosses, and we have to have that open _x000D_
door."
2926726,2926725,2926727,19244,3,"    So how is that relationship? Is that _x000D_
different agency to agency? How are the Inspectors General _x000D_
getting out, getting into the cubicles, getting a chance to _x000D_
visit with people, getting the feedback and ideas in that _x000D_
relationship? Is this a piece of paper in the break room that _x000D_
says if there is a suggestion here is where to call? Or is this _x000D_
an actual relationship that is out there being built?"
2926727,2926726,2926728,19244,3,"    It varies across the 72 IGs. As we have seen _x000D_
in the newspaper reports, various agencies have had issues with _x000D_
how they have dealt with whistleblower issues, and those have _x000D_
played out publicly. One of the things we have tried to do--and _x000D_
I know other IGs are doing and working with the Office of _x000D_
Special Counsel, for example--is getting certified pursuant to _x000D_
Section 2302, working with the agencies to get them certified _x000D_
pursuant to Section 2302, which is essentially an educational _x000D_
effort, to make sure managers and staff understand their _x000D_
rights, understand what they are supposed to do when an _x000D_
employee wants to come forward, and what they are not supposed _x000D_
to do when an employee comes forward. And study after study on _x000D_
these issues shows that what employees, whistleblowers, want to _x000D_
see is some responsiveness to their concerns and that they _x000D_
almost inevitably stay within their chain of commands first._x000D_
    Coming to us as an OIG is usually an extraordinary step for _x000D_
somebody. They want to see change occur within their _x000D_
organization and within their own working group. And so we as _x000D_
IGs have to be sensitive to that, and that is something we have _x000D_
worked on, as I said, internally, but also getting our message _x000D_
out externally."
2926728,2926727,2926729,19244,3,"    And that should be obviously working _x000D_
within the chain of command. If the first call is the Equal _x000D_
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or to the IGs or _x000D_
something, this suddenly blew up in a hurry, it should be _x000D_
resolved within chain of command most of the time. My concern _x000D_
is that for individuals that feel frustrated, it is not getting _x000D_
resolved._x000D_
    I am going to flip the subject here real quick while we are _x000D_
dealing with personnel issues. This Committee also has the _x000D_
Federal workforce as well as multiple other areas. The issue of _x000D_
probation in the Federal workforce has been one that IGs have _x000D_
looked at over and over again. Administrative leave has been _x000D_
one of those issues that there have been multiple issues on how _x000D_
to be able to handle this. Any new recommendations or ideas _x000D_
dealing with probationary periods or administrative leave that _x000D_
have come up?"
2926729,2926728,2926730,19244,3,"    We have actually been working with some of _x000D_
the members recently. We are putting together a bill on this _x000D_
and communicating some of the issues we have seen, and I agree _x000D_
with you. One of the things we have tried to do, again, within _x000D_
our own agency is work with the Justice Department to try and _x000D_
ensure that they have information and understand when someone _x000D_
truly needs to be on administrative leave or perhaps just needs _x000D_
to be reassigned while we finish our work. And we are learning _x000D_
that is an experience we have across the IG community that we _x000D_
are sitting with Members of Congress right now as they are _x000D_
putting together a bill to address some of these concerns, and _x000D_
Senator Grassley in particular has been involved in that _x000D_
effort. I know a number of other members have as well."
2926730,2926729,2926731,19244,3,    OK. Thank you.
2926731,2926730,2926732,19244,3,"    Going back, James was talking about, the _x000D_
carrot and the stick. Let us talk a little bit about the _x000D_
carrot, which is, how do we reward agencies who can find cost _x000D_
savings so that they can actually kind of reward employees. I _x000D_
am curious, Gene, have you seen any agencies that have run a _x000D_
very good--tell us what your efficiency idea is and we will _x000D_
implement it and, kind of a good reward system for Federal _x000D_
employees to basically participate in cost savings."
2926732,2926731,2926733,19244,3,"    I would have to go back and check. I know we _x000D_
have looked over the years at various efforts including gain-_x000D_
sharing ideas, and they always ran into methodological problems _x000D_
in justifying the savings, having good data to justify any _x000D_
rewards, and then how the allocations would be done. But I know _x000D_
that there needs to be better incentives, because a lot of _x000D_
agencies will say, well, if we save the money, we do not get to _x000D_
keep any of it, and so what is the incentive?_x000D_
    And so I will go back and give you a thorough answer on _x000D_
this and understand a little bit, but I know enough to know and _x000D_
feel confident of telling you it is not where it needs to be."
2926733,2926732,2926734,19244,3,"    Right._x000D_
    My point is we can kind of threaten agency heads with, _x000D_
whistleblower and, we are out to get you, or we can provide _x000D_
incentives for them to look for the cost savings and for them _x000D_
to actually participate with us in encouraging employees to _x000D_
step up and rewarding employees who do step up with great ideas _x000D_
on saving money. I just honestly believe that there is a plan _x000D_
out there or there could be a plan out there that could reap _x000D_
greater rewards, and more than anyone else, you have that kind _x000D_
of view from a mile high on all these agencies. And so I would _x000D_
be really curious about, what agency you have seen that has _x000D_
done a particularly good job incentivizing employees to _x000D_
participate in cost reduction._x000D_
    Finally, I have one question that goes back to workforce _x000D_
and is something that you raised early on, Mike, which is this _x000D_
idea of cybersecurity. My question is: Do you think that there _x000D_
is adequate expertise within agencies--and this is probably for _x000D_
you, too, Gene--adequate expertise within agencies on cyber _x000D_
issues--and we say, obviously, very high profile instances of _x000D_
data breaches--today that protect that Federal database from _x000D_
hacking, that protect, critical infrastructure of this country? _x000D_
Do you think we have the employee base?"
2926734,2926733,2926735,19244,3,"    We just actually did a review of that earlier _x000D_
this year on the next-generation cyber initiative that the FBI _x000D_
does. We looked at this issue extensively within the FBI, and _x000D_
that was one of our most significant findings, is the FBI has _x000D_
lots of vacancies in these very critical positions for the _x000D_
reasons we now see in the news as to how important it is to _x000D_
have the right staff. Pay is an issue. Recruitment and other _x000D_
issues arise in getting top-notch talent to fill those jobs, _x000D_
and we found lots of vacancies and made recommendations _x000D_
regarding that."
2926735,2926734,2926736,19244,3,"    I know we are running a little bit over, _x000D_
but I am curious what you think the three key recommendations _x000D_
are to fill that gap."
2926736,2926735,2926737,19244,3,"    Well, one is pay. The FBI simply cannot _x000D_
compete on some of these positions, as we learned, with private _x000D_
sector opportunities._x000D_
    A second issue which Director Comey has talked about is _x000D_
some of the background checks that go on, and that the FBI has _x000D_
to think about how they do that for the current graduates and _x000D_
individuals they want to recruit for these positions and _x000D_
thinking about how do they attract the right talent and get _x000D_
them through, people who can get through the background _x000D_
investigation process._x000D_
    So those were just a couple of things that we identified as _x000D_
well as outreach and greater recruitment efforts."
2926737,2926736,2926738,19244,3,"    Senator, I would just add, if I might----"
2926738,2926737,2926739,19244,3,    You bet.
2926739,2926738,2926740,19244,3,"    On the cyber area, there are critical skill _x000D_
gaps, clearly, and it is part of the issue. We first put _x000D_
cybersecurity on our High-Risk List in 1997. It was the first _x000D_
time that we ever identified a high-risk topic across the _x000D_
entire Federal Government as part of our high-risk effort. We _x000D_
added critical infrastructure protection in 2003. We just _x000D_
recently added the need to protect personally identifiable _x000D_
information (PII). People's skills are part of the problem, but _x000D_
also they do not have comprehensive security programs in place _x000D_
with good training for employees. A lot of malicious attacks _x000D_
come from employees clicking on emails and attachments that _x000D_
they should not._x000D_
    Hundreds of our open recommendations are on the information _x000D_
security area and actions the agencies need to take. That is _x000D_
probably the single largest category of recommendations we make _x000D_
every year, because we do this across government along with the _x000D_
IGs. And there are just hundreds of these things, very _x000D_
technical things that they need to do, where they have not _x000D_
upgraded, they have not patched quickly, they need to do _x000D_
continuous monitoring. But the people part is important, but it _x000D_
is not the full set of recommendations."
2926740,2926739,2926741,19244,3,"    Right, and the first line of defense is _x000D_
cyber hygiene."
2926741,2926740,2926742,19244,3,    Right.
2926742,2926741,2926743,19244,3,"    There are things that can happen every _x000D_
day that will make us safer, but it is not institutionalized. _x000D_
We just need to understand on this Committee the workforce _x000D_
issues, which is why I asked the question."
2926743,2926742,2926744,19244,3,"    I have one final question as well dealing _x000D_
with the grants, something, Michael, you brought up earlier _x000D_
about the grant issues. Obviously, a large portion of Federal _x000D_
funding is shifting toward the grant side of it. How are we _x000D_
doing on oversight, both selection of individuals to make sure _x000D_
that our agencies, when they are selecting people to receive _x000D_
grants, have good oversight with that in the process of it and _x000D_
the results are actually benefiting the national security and _x000D_
economic benefit of the Nation?"
2926744,2926743,2926745,19244,3,"    I think on the former issue, in terms of how _x000D_
the grant-making agencies are scoring and awarding grants, I _x000D_
think we have seen a very significant amount of progress and, _x000D_
generally speaking, strong movement forward on doing that in a _x000D_
more rigorous way. I think the issue many of the IGs have, _x000D_
including myself, is the back-end issue that you just _x000D_
mentioned, which is how are we really analyzing the performance _x000D_
measurements and what kind of metrics are we using to undertake _x000D_
that analysis._x000D_
    Oftentimes I think we have seen that it is much more of a _x000D_
check-the-box approach if you said you would treat 500 people, _x000D_
we see you sent us reports that show you treated 500 people. _x000D_
Well, the next question would be: What happened?"
2926745,2926744,2926746,19244,3,    Did it help?
2926746,2926745,2926747,19244,3,"    Did it help? What is the outcome? And that is _x000D_
where we are not seeing as much rigor as certainly myself and _x000D_
several other IGs think should be occurring. And that is a _x000D_
reason why--and in our top management challenges this year and _x000D_
last year--we put on there that issue in terms of metrics _x000D_
generally to be addressed by the Department."
2926747,2926746,2926748,19244,3,"    So what can we do as a Congress to be _x000D_
able to help with that? Because every year--my office just put _x000D_
out a report, as I mentioned earlier, that lists some of the _x000D_
grants. Obviously, I did not go through all of them, but they _x000D_
are some of the grants that you clearly come back and say, How _x000D_
does this help the national security of the United States? _x000D_
There was a grant that was given last year researching, Do _x000D_
media outlets drive the political climate of the Nation, or _x000D_
does the political climate of the Nation drive the media _x000D_
outlets? Why in the world did Federal taxpayers pay for that? I _x000D_
understand that might be a good research study for a university _x000D_
to do or for any media organization to do, but I do not see how _x000D_
that drives the benefit of the taxpayer to do a political _x000D_
research study like that. That was a study that was done, _x000D_
$375,000 to study the dating habits of senior adults. Well, I _x000D_
raised the question and said, ``Tell me why the Federal _x000D_
taxpayer needed to pay for that particular study.''_x000D_
    What can we do to help on that? Because there are really _x000D_
important research projects that are out there that the Federal _x000D_
taxpayer can and should be a part of, but we do not want them _x000D_
to get clouted or money to be squandered on things that are not _x000D_
important to the Federal taxpayer when there are other things _x000D_
that are."
2926748,2926747,2926749,19244,3,"    Right. Well, through the appropriation and _x000D_
grant-making process, Congress puts in all sorts of language _x000D_
about certain measures it wants to see take place and occur, _x000D_
and certainly in that legislation, there can be requirements _x000D_
about reporting certain information and certain metrics and _x000D_
having OMB through its omnicirculars put requirements in place _x000D_
across the Executive Branch would be helpful as well so that it _x000D_
is not agency by agency, which is one of the struggles we have _x000D_
as IGs._x000D_
    And I will add that in another plug for the IG Empowerment _x000D_
Act that this Committee has put forward is an exemption from _x000D_
the Computer Matching Act, which would allow us to look at, as _x000D_
IGs, across the Federal Government some of the improper payment _x000D_
issues that you have been discussing with Gene earlier. That _x000D_
would allow us as IGs to stop looking at this simply as _x000D_
department by department, but looking at what grants are our _x000D_
agencies doing. Duplicative grants has been an issue that we _x000D_
have been looking at and I know the GAO has been looking at. We _x000D_
struggle to understand and look at the question of not only are _x000D_
there duplicative grants within the Justice Department but _x000D_
across Federal agencies. And one of the things that we would be _x000D_
advanced on by the IG Empowerment Act is being able to perhaps _x000D_
share that data more regularly with each other."
2926749,2926748,2926750,19244,3,"    Can I add to this discussion something _x000D_
that is on the other end, which is, $20,000, we are going to _x000D_
help you, do some outreach with kids who might be runaways, and _x000D_
you end up costing that agency $5,000 in audit costs. So at _x000D_
some point, we have both ends of the spectrum, not enough, but _x000D_
then also, this kind of check-the-box accountability that leads _x000D_
to very high administrative costs on grants._x000D_
    I would recommend that you take a look at what that _x000D_
accountability, especially the financial accountability piece, _x000D_
make recommendations to us and to other folks about, we asked _x000D_
for that, it is a check-the-box thing; it is not significant. _x000D_
We get that occasionally something might slip through the _x000D_
cracks and we end up paying something we should not. But we are _x000D_
creating a multibillion-dollar industry on the audit side with _x000D_
very little protection to the taxpayer._x000D_
    I would just lay that on top of James' accountability on _x000D_
one end. Let us take a look at whether we are driving up _x000D_
administrative costs and actually resulting in inefficiencies _x000D_
through accountability measures that do not add to the security _x000D_
and safety of the Federal Treasury."
2926750,2926749,2926751,19244,3,"    First, on the point that you are making, there _x000D_
are inefficiencies not only in the audit process but in the _x000D_
application process and the whole delivery system. We have a _x000D_
very complicated, expensive intergovernmental delivery system _x000D_
in the United States that I think needs to be reexamined and _x000D_
roles and responsibilities clarified. The Federal Government is _x000D_
on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path. State and local _x000D_
governments are under a lot of fiscal stress as well for a lot _x000D_
of the same reasons. I do not have empirical information yet to _x000D_
support this, but my instincts tell me that we cannot support _x000D_
the complicated intergovernmental delivery system in the future _x000D_
in the same manner and expect to get a good result at the end._x000D_
    With regard to the issue you raise, Senator Lankford, I _x000D_
believe we need a paradigm shift. Right now programs get funded _x000D_
year after year without having to demonstrate that they had a _x000D_
positive result on anything. And when we go in and look at _x000D_
overlap and duplication, we find many programs that have never _x000D_
been evaluated. So there is really not any empirical _x000D_
information to say that the investment that we have made is _x000D_
working very effectively. And it is up to the auditors to prove _x000D_
that the program is not doing something, you have to really _x000D_
prove that it is not doing anything for it to ever get stopped. _x000D_
This is in contrast to having positive assurance that the _x000D_
program was really successful in achieving its objectives and _x000D_
having good, independent evaluation results to say if we _x000D_
continue to fund this program, we will get good results._x000D_
    I think that that it is totally backward in the way it is _x000D_
now. Unless that changes, you are not going to get a different _x000D_
outcome."
2926751,2926750,2926752,19244,3,"    I would absolutely agree, and this _x000D_
hearing is not about legislation because we do not try to come _x000D_
with a pre-set piece on this. This is about trying to bring _x000D_
openness on it, but there are several pieces that do come up. _x000D_
The IG Empowerment Act has come up over and over again, which _x000D_
this Committee has already worked through. The Taxpayers Right-_x000D_
to-Know, that bill which does transparency and also evaluates _x000D_
the metrics, that paradigm shift that you talked about, that is _x000D_
currently working through the Senate right now. And in the _x000D_
Grant Act, which has also been thrown around here, trying to _x000D_
provide some basic transparency in how we do grants, those are _x000D_
pieces that are currently in process of working through the _x000D_
Senate._x000D_
    So our hope is that we can actually get some solutions on _x000D_
top of some of these big issues, but I appreciate it very much. _x000D_
Any other final comments?"
2926752,2926751,2926753,19244,3,"    No. Just once again thank you so much, _x000D_
and, I hope this has been a good discussion for you as well as _x000D_
for us and gives you some ideas of what we are looking at._x000D_
    I just really believe that this collaboration and _x000D_
partnership between this Committee and particularly this _x000D_
Subcommittee and you guys talking back and forth, I hope you _x000D_
find that that is a useful use of your time, because we really _x000D_
take seriously what you tell us and the need to move these _x000D_
ideas forward if we are going to be responsive to the _x000D_
taxpayers."
2926753,2926752,2926754,19244,3,"    I just want to say I really appreciate from _x000D_
GAO's perspective this hearing and the time and attention that _x000D_
you are giving to this subject. It is very important for our _x000D_
organization and our people to know that our work is valued and _x000D_
that we have this support. And there is no way that these _x000D_
recommendations will get implemented effectively without _x000D_
executive agency cooperation and congressional oversight._x000D_
    So it is imperative. We will dialogue with you as much as _x000D_
you want in order to make this a better government."
2926754,2926753,2926755,19244,3,"    Well, just for the American people, I _x000D_
would say from last year about $74 billion in thanks back to _x000D_
GAO and what they have done for the IG and for so much work _x000D_
that has been done to be able to protect the taxpayer and _x000D_
Federal employees and folks around the country._x000D_
    Thank you again. The hearing record will remain open until _x000D_
5 p.m., Monday, December 28, for anyone who over Christmas _x000D_
wants to be able to put together their submission statements _x000D_
and questions for the record. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    With that, gentlemen, thank you very much. This hearing is _x000D_
adjourned."
2926755,2926754,2926756,19246,1,"    Good morning, everyone. I am glad that _x000D_
everyone is here for this Subcommittee hearing._x000D_
    The Subcommittee has held a series of hearings examining _x000D_
the regulatory process. We determined over the course of these _x000D_
hearings that a robust, efficient process will lead to better _x000D_
regulations and better regulatory outcomes. We have not had a _x000D_
lot of dissent on that. It is a matter of just working on the _x000D_
process._x000D_
    Today's hearing focuses on the proper role of regulatory _x000D_
enforcement. It goes without saying that writing a law or _x000D_
developing a regulation is easier than actually enforcing it _x000D_
across the 50 States and our Territories in a fair, _x000D_
predictable, and consistent manner. But doing so is essential. _x000D_
Fair, predictable, consistent regulatory enforcement procedures _x000D_
must be understandable for all stakeholders._x000D_
    I believe that most Federal agencies agree that _x000D_
transparency is important and that providing accessible _x000D_
compliance assistance services is essential to any _x000D_
comprehensive enforcement regime. Safety, fairness, fighting _x000D_
discrimination are all great goals of our regulators and of _x000D_
enforcement. I think that is a reasonable thing._x000D_
    But, as we have learned from previous hearings, the sheer _x000D_
magnitude of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) means that _x000D_
understanding and complying with regulations is a gargantuan _x000D_
task for most individuals and businesses. The complexity of the _x000D_
regulatory system, coupled with the fear that failure to _x000D_
comply, even if complying is completely accidental, will result _x000D_
in a fine or penalty, that means that a business will feel they _x000D_
are targeted for arbitrary violations that they do not fully _x000D_
understand._x000D_
    As a result, regulated parties often feel confused. They _x000D_
deal with conflicting compliance information and it leaves them _x000D_
vulnerable to the whims of any regulator. In fact, one small _x000D_
business owner from one of the States mentioned back to us that _x000D_
when faced with the overwhelming number of regulatory _x000D_
requirements, ``what chance does a business have? ''_x000D_
    Indeed, many individuals and businesses believe that agency _x000D_
officials enforce regulations in an unfair, unpredictable, and _x000D_
arbitrary manner. Because businesses often feel they are _x000D_
targeted arbitrarily, they are understandably fearful at times _x000D_
of Federal regulators._x000D_
    I hear stories from businesses that their only interaction _x000D_
with agency enforcement issues is to inspect and issue fines. _x000D_
As a result, my constituents tell me that their relationship _x000D_
with agencies have deteriorated and that instead of inspectors _x000D_
working with businesses to identify and solve compliance _x000D_
problems, government regulators show up, issue a fine and _x000D_
punishment._x000D_
    When businesses choose to avoid interaction with Federal _x000D_
agencies and dread inspections, our shared regulatory goals are _x000D_
not achieved and we have a breakdown between the government _x000D_
that is designed to serve people and the people that they _x000D_
serve._x000D_
    Agencies should play an active role in changing this _x000D_
culture. Agency officials, starting at the top, can set the _x000D_
tone by emphasizing compliance assistance, prevention through _x000D_
education, so that finable offenses, not to mention larger _x000D_
tragedies, do not occur in the first place. If businesses are _x000D_
no longer apprehensive in approaching an agency when they need _x000D_
clarification, they will likely find regulatory compliance _x000D_
easier and it will be more successful in compliance goals. In _x000D_
turn, all of us will enjoy safer workplaces and a cleaner _x000D_
environment._x000D_
    I look forward today to discussing our shared goals and _x000D_
feasible solutions. It is my hope we can start setting a tone _x000D_
in all of our agencies that helps engage with people and helps _x000D_
the people that are designed to serve the Nation and the people _x000D_
that we serve to actually have a better relationship in the _x000D_
days ahead._x000D_
    With that, I would recognize Ranking Member Senator _x000D_
Heitkamp for her opening remarks."
2926756,2926755,2926757,19246,1,"    Thank you, Chairman Lankford, for holding _x000D_
this hearing today and, giving us all an opportunity to explore _x000D_
this topic in our regulatory process._x000D_
    I am interested in hearing from our witnesses today as we _x000D_
examine how regulatory enforcement is working on the ground to _x000D_
improve compliance as we identify ways in which Congress and _x000D_
the administration can work together to improve compliance with _x000D_
our regulations._x000D_
    For our Nation to be successful and safe, for our citizens _x000D_
to be able to work hard and provide for their families, we need _x000D_
a regulatory process that works for American business and _x000D_
American families. That means we need to have enforcement _x000D_
mechanisms to ensure everyone is playing by the same set of _x000D_
rules._x000D_
    To that end, fines, penalties, restitution orders, and _x000D_
other sanctions are critical tools that the government has at _x000D_
its disposal to achieve compliance and deter wrongdoers from _x000D_
violating Federal laws and regulations. Without such tools, _x000D_
agencies have very little leverage in which to ensure the _x000D_
safety and health of our citizens and our environment._x000D_
    However, on the other side of the same coin, I believe that _x000D_
ensuring regulated agencies and entities have the necessary _x000D_
resources and information to successfully comply with _x000D_
regulations should also be our top priority. In fact, we have _x000D_
these mechanisms to ensure compliance and no one should feel _x000D_
like they are living in a ``gotcha'' world, where they are _x000D_
unaware of what the requirements are and only fearful that the _x000D_
sheriff will show up and slap a big fine on when they did not _x000D_
even know that they had an obligation to comply with a _x000D_
regulation._x000D_
    So, therefore, I am also interested in learning how your _x000D_
agencies focus their energy and resources on compliance _x000D_
assistance programs and ensure that entities are aware of what _x000D_
those requirements are. Specifically, I would like to know how _x000D_
both of your agencies work with small business to ensure that _x000D_
regulatory requirements are clear, transparent, and accessible. _x000D_
I know that both of your agencies work very closely with the _x000D_
Small Business Administration (SBA) and their office to ensure _x000D_
that small business concerns are appropriately addressed and _x000D_
quickly addressed._x000D_
    So, I look forward to hearing from both of you and hearing _x000D_
your insights as part of this all-important job that we have to _x000D_
do, which is to keep our citizens safe."
2926757,2926756,2926758,19246,1,"    At this time, we will proceed with _x000D_
testimony from our witnesses._x000D_
    Jordan Barab is the current Deputy Assistant Secretary of _x000D_
Labor at Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), _x000D_
a post he has held since April 2009. Prior to his current _x000D_
position, Mr. Barab served as Special Assistant to the _x000D_
Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA. Mr. Barab has also _x000D_
worked with the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation _x000D_
Board and for the House Education and Labor Committee. Thank _x000D_
you for being here, Mr. Barab._x000D_
    Susan Shinkman is the Director of the Office of Civil _x000D_
Enforcement (OCE) at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), _x000D_
a post that she has held since August 2012. Prior to this post, _x000D_
she served as the Chief Counsel to the Pennsylvania Department _x000D_
of Environmental Protection. She also served as Chief Counsel _x000D_
to Pennsylvania's Inspector General (IG) and the Pennsylvania _x000D_
Department of Labor and Industry. Ms. Shinkman also served as _x000D_
Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office _x000D_
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania._x000D_
    I would like to thank you both for appearing here as _x000D_
witnesses. It is the tradition and custom of this Subcommittee _x000D_
to swear in all witnesses, so if you would please stand and _x000D_
raise your right hand._x000D_
    Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this _x000D_
Subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing _x000D_
but the truth, so help you, God?"
2926758,2926757,2926759,19246,1,    I do.
2926759,2926758,2926760,19246,1,    I do.
2926760,2926759,2926761,19246,1,"    Thank you. You may be seated. Let the _x000D_
record reflect the witnesses have answered in the affirmative._x000D_
    We will use a timing system. You will see a countdown clock _x000D_
in front of you. We are not strict on time except that we have _x000D_
10:30 votes that are being called today, and so be very _x000D_
attentive to time to make sure that we get plenty of time for _x000D_
your testimony as well as the questions of those that are here _x000D_
at the dais today. Your written testimony will already be a _x000D_
part of the permanent record, so anything in your oral _x000D_
testimony that you would like to share beyond your written _x000D_
testimony is acceptable, whatever may be._x000D_
    Mr. Barab, typically, we go ladies first, but today, we are _x000D_
making an exception to be able to have you go first, if you are _x000D_
OK with that, and have you be able to kick off today. So, we _x000D_
will receive your testimony now._x000D_
_x000D_
   TESTIMONY OF JORDAN BARAB,\1\ DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, _x000D_
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, U."
2926761,2926760,2926762,19246,1,"    Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairman _x000D_
Lankford, Ranking Member Heitkamp, and distinguished Members of _x000D_
the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here today._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Barab appears in the Appendix on _x000D_
page 28._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Occupational _x000D_
Safety and Health Administration, I am honored to testify about _x000D_
the important work we are doing. As you know, OSHA's mission is _x000D_
to ensure the safety and health of roughly 130 million workers. _x000D_
Over the last 45 years since OSHA was created, we have made _x000D_
dramatic progress in reducing work-related deaths and injuries, _x000D_
but there is still a great deal more to do._x000D_
    I would like to begin today by briefly discussing OSHA's _x000D_
investigation and citation process. OSHA recognizes that most _x000D_
employers want to keep their employees safe, but there are _x000D_
still far too many employers who cut corners and fail to _x000D_
protect their employees. For these employers, avoiding OSHA _x000D_
penalties remains an effective incentive._x000D_
    Under the OSH Act, the Department is authorized to conduct _x000D_
inspections and issue penalties for health and safety hazards. _x000D_
The OSH Act also sets forth the types and amounts of potential _x000D_
penalties. For instance, OSHA penalties for willful or repeat _x000D_
violations have a maximum of $70,000 for each violation. _x000D_
Penalties for serious violations have a maximum of $7,000 per _x000D_
violation. Until recently, these figures have remained static. _x000D_
However, the 2015 bipartisan budget bill passed by Congress _x000D_
raised penalties and provided an opportunity for penalties to _x000D_
be indexed to inflation for the first time._x000D_
    The primary purpose of the penalties is deterrence. Any _x000D_
funds collected are deposited in the U.S. Treasury and are not _x000D_
used to support agency functions._x000D_
    OSHA carefully considers the impact of our penalties on _x000D_
small businesses. We take into account several factors. OSHA _x000D_
generally reduces penalties for small employers as well as _x000D_
those acting in good faith and employers with no recent _x000D_
citations. In fact, the average OSHA penalty for a serious _x000D_
violation is roughly $2,000. Sadly, these penalties can often _x000D_
seem too low. This is particularly true for incidents involving _x000D_
worker fatalities, where the penalty is often only a few _x000D_
thousand dollars._x000D_
    Workplace inspections and investigations are conducted by _x000D_
OSHA compliance officers. They are trained safety and health _x000D_
professionals who are given strict procedures that they must _x000D_
follow. OSHA conducts two general types of inspections, _x000D_
programmed and unprogrammed. Programmed inspections account for _x000D_
roughly 46 percent of inspections and specifically target the _x000D_
most dangerous workplaces and the most recalcitrant employers. _x000D_
Unprogrammed inspections account for 54 percent of inspections. _x000D_
They are initiated for several reasons, including worker _x000D_
complaints, referrals, employer reports, and followup _x000D_
inspections._x000D_
    OSHA's primary goal is correcting hazards, not issuing _x000D_
citations or collecting penalties. As a result, when OSHA _x000D_
issues a citation, we always offer the employer an informal _x000D_
conference with the area director. The agency and the employer _x000D_
may work out a settlement agreement. Last year, 65 percent of _x000D_
inspections with a citation resulted in informal settlements._x000D_
    Alternatively, employers can formally contest the alleged _x000D_
violations and/or penalties. Last year, this happened in 7.4 _x000D_
percent of cases. These contests were sent to the Occupational _x000D_
Safety and Health Review Commission for independent review._x000D_
    At the same time, we recognize that most employers want to _x000D_
do the right thing and we are committed to ensuring that they _x000D_
have the tools and information they need. This is why we have _x000D_
made compliance assistance a priority. We work diligently to _x000D_
provide training, educational materials, and consultation _x000D_
services to employers and workers. New OSHA standards and _x000D_
enforcement initiatives are always accompanied by webpages, _x000D_
fact sheets, guidance documents, webinars, interactive training _x000D_
programs, and special products for small businesses._x000D_
    The cornerstone of this effort is our onsite consultation _x000D_
program for small and medium-sized businesses. Last year, close _x000D_
to 30,000 employers took advantage of this free, high-quality _x000D_
service. A full 87 percent of these visits were to businesses _x000D_
with fewer than 100 employees._x000D_
    OSHA also continues its strong support for recognizing _x000D_
employers who make safety and health a priority. Through the _x000D_
Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) and _x000D_
the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), we recognize employers _x000D_
who have developed outstanding injury and illness prevention _x000D_
programs. SHARP and VPP employers demonstrate that safety pays. _x000D_
They serve as models for other businesses to follow._x000D_
    Another critical piece of our strategy effort is the Susan _x000D_
Harwood Training Grant Program. This program provides funding _x000D_
to nonprofit organizations for valuable training and technical _x000D_
assistance for vulnerable workers and workers in small _x000D_
businesses._x000D_
    OSHA also provides additional cooperative programs designed _x000D_
to encourage, assist, and recognize efforts to eliminate _x000D_
hazards and enhance workplace safety and health practices. For _x000D_
example, OSHA has an alliance with the National Service _x000D_
Transmission, Exploration, and Production Safety (STEPS) _x000D_
Network, along with the National Institute for Occupational _x000D_
Safety and Health (NIOSH), to help employers reduce injuries _x000D_
and fatalities in the oil and gas industry._x000D_
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify about the _x000D_
work we are doing every day to improve the safety and health of _x000D_
American workers and how we put great effort into making sure _x000D_
employers have all the necessary tools they need to meet their _x000D_
responsibilities._x000D_
    I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

   TESTIMONY OF SUSAN SHINKMAN,\1\ DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF CIVIL _x000D_
 ENFORCEMENT, OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE, _x000D_
              U."
2926763,2926762,2926764,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member _x000D_
Heitkamp, and Members of the Subcommittee. I am Susan Shinkman. _x000D_
I am the Director of the Office of Civil Enforcement, an office _x000D_
within EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. We _x000D_
are responsible for developing and prosecuting civil, _x000D_
administrative, and judicial cases and providing legal support _x000D_
for cases and investigations initiated by EPA regional offices. _x000D_
Thank you for the opportunity to testify about how EPA meets _x000D_
the challenge of ensuring consistent implementation and _x000D_
enforcement of Federal environmental laws and regulations._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Shinkman appears in the Appendix _x000D_
on page 39._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    Our mission is to protect both human health and the _x000D_
environment by ensuring compliance with environmental laws. EPA _x000D_
regions support the national programs while working to ensure _x000D_
that EPA's work complements State, Tribal, and local _x000D_
environmental priorities._x000D_
    To provide consistency across the regions and headquarters, _x000D_
the civil enforcement and compliance programs employ statute-_x000D_
specific policies to address compliance monitoring, enforcement _x000D_
responses to violations, and penalty assessments._x000D_
    EPA recognizes the role of small businesses in the Nation's _x000D_
economy and has developed innovative compliance assistance _x000D_
tools to help the small business community understand and _x000D_
comply with environmental requirements. When a new rule _x000D_
implemented--impacting small entities EPA prepares Small Entity _x000D_
Compliance Guides, which explain the actions that a small _x000D_
entity must take to comply. When EPA conducts an inspection of _x000D_
a small business, we hand out information related to the rights _x000D_
of the small business. Under our small business compliance _x000D_
policy, EPA will eliminate or significantly reduce penalties _x000D_
for small businesses that discover violations and promptly _x000D_
disclose and correct them._x000D_
    In recognition of these efforts, the Small Business _x000D_
Administration has given EPA's enforcement and compliance _x000D_
program as it affects small businesses an A rating for every _x000D_
year since 2005._x000D_
    One of the ways that EPA's regional offices, together with _x000D_
their State, local, and Tribal partners, monitor compliance is _x000D_
through inspections of facilities. Inspectors record _x000D_
observations and identify areas of concern, and at the _x000D_
conclusion of the inspection, they will discuss their _x000D_
observations with the regulated entity. If followup is needed, _x000D_
EPA will work with the regulated entity to remedy the _x000D_
violations._x000D_
    The vast majority of our enforcement cases are resolved _x000D_
through a settlement. Approximately 90 percent are handled _x000D_
administratively, while larger, more complex matters are _x000D_
usually handled as civil judicial cases in conjunction with the _x000D_
Department of Justice (DOJ)._x000D_
    In addition to injunctive relief to ensure compliance, EPA _x000D_
does seek penalties to achieve deterrence and remove any _x000D_
significant economic benefit resulting from noncompliance. This _x000D_
levels the playing field by preventing companies that break the _x000D_
law from having an unfair competitive advantage. EPA's penalty _x000D_
policies also provide for a reduction in penalty based on _x000D_
ability to pay._x000D_
    EPA has made tremendous progress toward achieving cleaner _x000D_
air, water, and land over the last four decades. We will _x000D_
continue to work with States, Tribes, and local governments to _x000D_
make smart choices about priorities, to take advantage of _x000D_
innovations, and to ensure that the most important work is done _x000D_
first._x000D_
    EPA's enforcement program is designed to produce consistent _x000D_
and fair results that achieve compliance, cure noncompliance, _x000D_
deter future violations, and benefit human health and the _x000D_
environment._x000D_
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify and I would be _x000D_
happy to answer any questions."
2926764,2926763,2926765,19246,1,"    Thank you. Thank you both._x000D_
    The Chairman and Ranking Member are going to defer our _x000D_
questions toward the end and I would recognize Senator Peters _x000D_
for the first question."
2926765,2926764,2926766,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for _x000D_
deferring. I do need to leave to speak on the floor, so I _x000D_
appreciate this opportunity. I will be on the floor talking _x000D_
about the situation we have in Flint, Michigan, and appreciate _x000D_
the opportunity to ask a question of Ms. Shinkman._x000D_
    Ms. Shinkman, on December 8, 2009, the EPA sent a _x000D_
memorandum to its regional administrators titled, ``Proposed _x000D_
Revisions to Enforcement Response Policy for the Public Water _x000D_
System Supervision Program.'' In this document, which is _x000D_
attributed to an Assistant Administrator in your office at the _x000D_
time, Cynthia Giles, the memo outlines a risk-based approach _x000D_
for enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act to target repeat _x000D_
violators by assigning points based on the number and severity _x000D_
of violations. Page six of this document outlines EPA's _x000D_
enforcement response policy model for repeat violators. This _x000D_
policy states, and I quote, ``Responses to violations should _x000D_
escalate in formality as the violation continues or occurs.''_x000D_
    Additionally, I understand that in those States with _x000D_
primacy over enforcement, EPA is authorized after 30 days under _x000D_
the Safe Drinking Water Act to take certain actions to return a _x000D_
system to compliance. These authorities allow the EPA to issue _x000D_
administrative orders, impose fines, and pursue other civil and _x000D_
even criminal actions. The same EPA policy document explains _x000D_
that most enforcement actions are administrative in nature, _x000D_
but, I quote, ``judicial cases are also an important _x000D_
enforcement tool and the use of judicial authority is _x000D_
encouraged.''_x000D_
    So, understanding your agency's wide discretion in _x000D_
decisions of whether to levy fines against violators of our _x000D_
Nation's environmental laws, in the case of the Safe Drinking _x000D_
Water Act, we have a document here that encourages the EPA to _x000D_
seek judicial remedies when formal enforcement actions are _x000D_
necessary, whether in the form of injunctive relief, civil _x000D_
penalties, or criminal action._x000D_
    With this in mind, I want to direct your attention, as I _x000D_
mentioned, to my home State, in the city of Flint, where we, as _x000D_
you know, have a very difficult situation, where there have _x000D_
been a series of bad decisions that now have subjected the _x000D_
entire city to toxic lead-tainted water. Nearly 2 years ago, an _x000D_
unelected emergency manager that was appointed by Governor _x000D_
Snyder changed Flint's water source to the Flint River in order _x000D_
to save some money, and we know the result of that State _x000D_
decision has been catastrophic._x000D_
    The water crisis in Flint is an immense failure of Michigan _x000D_
State Government, certainly. The Michigan Department of _x000D_
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has admitted they failed to _x000D_
properly follow the Federal lead and copper rule and that they _x000D_
chose not to ensure optimal corrosion control treatment was in _x000D_
place going forward._x000D_
    Your agency's own emergency order invoked under authorities _x000D_
of the Safe Drinking Water Act on January 21 of this year _x000D_
states in its findings of fact, and I quote, ``The presence of _x000D_
lead in the city water supply is principally due to the lack of _x000D_
corrosion control treatment after the water source was switched _x000D_
and the city of Flint MDEQ and the State have failed to take _x000D_
adequate measures to protect public health.'' The emergency _x000D_
order also reserves EPA's right to commence civil action and _x000D_
assess civil penalties in order to ensure compliance with this _x000D_
order._x000D_
    However, the same document explains that EPA Region 5 staff _x000D_
first expressed concern about the lack of corrosion control _x000D_
back in May. That means the emergency order was issued at a _x000D_
minimum of 7 months after the EPA's concerns were first _x000D_
communicated to the State._x000D_
    So, if I am reading this law right, the EPA only has to _x000D_
wait 30 days before it can pursue enforcement actions on its _x000D_
own separate from the State, and at the very least, the EPA _x000D_
needs to have some authority to tell the public directly about _x000D_
this health crisis. That is why I have introduced legislation _x000D_
to require the EPA to notify the public after 15 days if a _x000D_
State has not done so. The House passed similar legislation _x000D_
just yesterday._x000D_
    So, my question to you is fairly simple. If your agency's _x000D_
own policy document encourages judicial action when a situation _x000D_
is escalating, why did the EPA wait so long to take action in _x000D_
Flint?"
2926766,2926765,2926767,19246,1,"    Senator, I appreciate your question and _x000D_
certainly your concerns. This is a very tragic and catastrophic _x000D_
issue. The authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act is to _x000D_
give primacy to the States to try and do their enforcement and _x000D_
make sure that the Safe Drinking Water Act is properly _x000D_
administered. In this case, clearly, there was a falling down _x000D_
on the appropriate measures. The EPA Regional Office, Region 5, _x000D_
was monitoring what was going on with the State over a period _x000D_
of time. Obviously, a significant amount of time passed in _x000D_
which perhaps other action should have been taken._x000D_
    My office became aware of it in the fall of last year. We _x000D_
worked with the region. We were monitoring what was going on. _x000D_
And, at the time we became aware of it, there were steps that _x000D_
were being taken. We monitored them as well as we could. When _x000D_
we realized that the situation required emergency action, we _x000D_
took the action on January 21 and issued that order._x000D_
    The order is very specific. It is issued to the State, the _x000D_
MDEQ, and the city of Flint. It has very specific requirements _x000D_
over a short period of time. We are monitoring that order on a _x000D_
daily, almost hourly, basis to make sure that we try to bring _x000D_
the city back into compliance and improve the drinking water in _x000D_
the city of Flint._x000D_
    We have taken that action. The most immediate need was to _x000D_
do emergency action. If that does not work, we will obviously _x000D_
be following through with other enforcement actions, _x000D_
potentially judicial."
2926767,2926766,2926768,19246,1,"    Well, and I know my time has expired, but I _x000D_
realize that you have taken action and have been much more _x000D_
focused on the Flint situation now, which I appreciate. But, _x000D_
why did that not happen months ago? As you know, every month _x000D_
that goes by with tainted water and children, in particular, _x000D_
who are consuming water with lead that creates irreparable _x000D_
damage to their brains, why was this not treated as a crisis _x000D_
immediately?"
2926768,2926767,2926769,19246,1,"    I cannot answer for everyone who was involved _x000D_
in it. I can say from my office, as we became more aware of it, _x000D_
we moved and we took the most appropriate action we could in _x000D_
January. Other people's actions earlier, I cannot account for _x000D_
all of them. I recognize the fact that it is a very important _x000D_
issue. It is certainly being looked into by a lot of people."
2926769,2926768,2926770,19246,1,"    So, what do we need to do going forward? _x000D_
How can we prevent this from ever happening again? What sort of _x000D_
actions do we need to take, or is there anything that we need _x000D_
to be doing working with you at the EPA?"
2926770,2926769,2926771,19246,1,"    From the EPA's standpoint, we are very aware _x000D_
of what happened. We are going to try and make sure it does not _x000D_
happen again. We are looking back at what happened here, and _x000D_
looking forward, we are scouring to make sure that something _x000D_
like that does not ever happen again. The authority is there. _x000D_
The emergency existed. We issued the emergency order. In a _x000D_
similar case, we would certainly issue a similar emergency _x000D_
order as soon as we could."
2926771,2926770,2926772,19246,1,"    Well, and I understand that there was some _x000D_
confusion within the EPA as to whether or not they should go _x000D_
public or whether or not you should go public with some of the _x000D_
tests that were coming forward, that is why I have introduced _x000D_
legislation with Senator Stabenow to require immediate public _x000D_
disclosure if a State does not take action, if a State is not _x000D_
making these tests available to the public that show elevated _x000D_
levels of lead or other toxins. I believe the House bill has _x000D_
even a quicker timeline of 24 hours that you have to report. _x000D_
Our bill has 15 days._x000D_
    But, we need to be very clear that if the EPA sees _x000D_
something, that you go public. There should be no ambiguity _x000D_
about that. It should be clear cut, straightforward, that the _x000D_
public has a right to know. Certainly, the State of Michigan _x000D_
bears primary responsibility for this crisis. There is no _x000D_
question about that. They need to step up. They broke it. They _x000D_
need to fix it. But, certainly, I am extremely disappointed _x000D_
with the EPA's response on this, as are so many people, and I _x000D_
think we can never tolerate the EPA not going public _x000D_
immediately when you have a building crisis of this magnitude._x000D_
    So, I will continue to work with you and your office and I _x000D_
look forward to working closely so that we can do whatever it _x000D_
takes to make sure that this never, ever happens again._x000D_
    Thank you."
2926772,2926771,2926773,19246,1,    Senator Portman.
2926773,2926772,2926774,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me just _x000D_
start by saying, with regard to Senator Peter's comments on _x000D_
water quality, we are working with the EPA on some issues in my _x000D_
State of Ohio. I do not know if you know Bob Kaplan, your _x000D_
Assistant Administrator, but I have spoken to him directly _x000D_
about some of these same issues. In our case, it is a small _x000D_
community called Sebring, Ohio, and the mayor, Mayor Pinkerton, _x000D_
and I have talked on occasion about, over the last 2 or 3 _x000D_
weeks, about EPA's role. We want to be sure EPA is providing _x000D_
the technical expertise and providing the kind of oversight _x000D_
that they are required to, but also providing transparency._x000D_
    So, I would ask you today, Ms. Shinkman, because you are _x000D_
here and because this topic is timely, if you could please _x000D_
ensure that, in fact, we are not having another case where the _x000D_
EPA is not providing the right kind of information to the _x000D_
people who are depending on the water supply. We think things _x000D_
are under control in Sebring right now, but in my conversations _x000D_
with Mr. Kaplan, I made it clear that we expect EPA to do its _x000D_
job and to provide the transparency to the people of that _x000D_
community."
2926774,2926773,2926775,19246,1,"    I appreciate that, Senator. I am aware of the _x000D_
situation. I believe EPA is directly involved at this point and _x000D_
will continue to monitor it."
2926775,2926774,2926776,19246,1,"    And, I want to thank the Chairman and _x000D_
Ranking Member for holding this hearing. We once again are _x000D_
seeing this Subcommittee do good work, and this is a _x000D_
Subcommittee to look at regulations and, therefore, the _x000D_
regulatory process including regulatory fines and penalties. _x000D_
They roll up their sleeves and jump into this, the Chairman and _x000D_
Ranking Member, and I really appreciate that, because I think _x000D_
there is increasing power in the regulatory system that has not _x000D_
had the proper oversight and this is one area._x000D_
    If you are a small business person, it is intimidating. You _x000D_
do not have the compliance people to figure out what all these _x000D_
potential regulatory issues are, much less what the fines and _x000D_
penalties might be, and if there is not a consistency in terms _x000D_
of the application and transparency in terms of what the rules _x000D_
are, it makes it very difficult, one, to comply, and two, _x000D_
again, just intimidation of not being able to figure out what _x000D_
the rules are._x000D_
    Mr. Barab, I did not get to hear your whole testimony, but _x000D_
I got to read some of it just now, and I appreciate your being _x000D_
here today and talking about what OSHA is doing to try to make _x000D_
it easier for people to understand, particularly small _x000D_
businesses, what the rules are. You have a thousand inspectors _x000D_
out there, is that right? I saw that in your testimony."
2926776,2926775,2926777,19246,1,"    Yes, a thousand in the Federal level and _x000D_
probably another 1,100----"
2926777,2926776,2926778,19246,1,    At the State level?
2926778,2926777,2926779,19246,1,"    Yes. So, you have 2,100 people, at least, _x000D_
but a thousand at the Federal level. That is a lot of people, _x000D_
and if you have the kind of flexibility I saw in your testimony _x000D_
and you have different applications depending on the situation, _x000D_
how do you have consistency, and what are you doing to ensure _x000D_
that there is a consistent application across the agency, _x000D_
understanding that flexibility is something you also want, _x000D_
because in some instances, that flexibility can be very helpful _x000D_
to a small business, to work more as a partner with them to _x000D_
resolve issues rather than an enforcement measure to punish _x000D_
them for something that they did not have the expertise to _x000D_
handle. So, talk about that."
2926779,2926778,2926780,19246,1,"    Yes. Thanks for the question. It is a good _x000D_
question, because that is one of our major challenges always, _x000D_
ensuring consistency among our inspectors around the country._x000D_
    We do train our inspectors very carefully when they first _x000D_
come on and continuously thereafter to ensure that they are _x000D_
complying with the procedures. We have what is known as our _x000D_
Field Operations Manual, which is a notebook about this size _x000D_
which contains all the procedures, all the enforcement _x000D_
procedures, the penalty procedures, the appeal procedures, _x000D_
everything that an inspector needs to make sure that they are _x000D_
doing their job, again, with that consistency, with the _x000D_
transparency that we value._x000D_
    We monitor that. I mean, we have a whole staff in _x000D_
Washington making sure that our inspectors do follow those _x000D_
procedures. We work very closely with our solicitors, again, _x000D_
when we run into difficult problems, again, to ensure that kind _x000D_
of consistency._x000D_
    Now, we also do, as you mentioned, have some flexibility _x000D_
there, and I think that is a good thing, because we are dealing _x000D_
with many employers who have a right to, and we listen to their _x000D_
defenses when that happens. We have a process where we have _x000D_
informal conferences after we issue the citations in order to _x000D_
discuss the problems that we found and to talk about possibly _x000D_
reducing fines or changing the citations. So, I think we do try _x000D_
to balance those procedures with some flexibility."
2926780,2926779,2926781,19246,1,"    Thank you. I appreciate that. And, again, _x000D_
your testimony was helpful in that regard and this Subcommittee _x000D_
is going to be looking at ways to increase that transparency _x000D_
and to let people know what the issues are that they have to _x000D_
address, but also, how the fines and penalties work._x000D_
    And, Ms. Shinkman, my time has now expired, but I assume _x000D_
that you are going to answer this further, how the EPA could _x000D_
increase the transparency in terms of letting people know what _x000D_
is going on. I am going to turn it back to the Chairman and _x000D_
Ranking Member, but I look forward to hearing what your _x000D_
response is to that."
2926781,2926780,2926782,19246,1,"    Ms. Shinkman, if you want to go ahead and _x000D_
answer that, you are certainly welcome to."
2926782,2926781,2926783,19246,1,"    Thank you. Yes, we are very concerned about _x000D_
those issues, as well--consistency, transparency, and _x000D_
flexibility in all of our penalty policies and our regulatory _x000D_
actions. For transparency, we have all of our policies on the _x000D_
web. They are available for anyone and you can see them by _x000D_
statute or by program area. Any of our proposed settlement _x000D_
agreements are open for public comment._x000D_
    For consistency, we have actually a specific policy for _x000D_
each statute that are applicable across all ten regions and _x000D_
headquarters so we all have the same standards to apply. We _x000D_
have training for our inspectors that is also done across the _x000D_
ten regions and with headquarters._x000D_
    We are also very concerned about flexibility, because we _x000D_
face big industries and small businesses, and so we have built _x000D_
into all of our policies many standards that we can look to to _x000D_
make sure that we are applying them flexibly. For example, we _x000D_
look at the compliance history of the entity. We certainly look _x000D_
at the size of the entity. That is a big issue for us because _x000D_
of the disparities that we see. We look at the good faith _x000D_
efforts to comply as opposed to willfulness of noncompliance. _x000D_
We look at the duration of any violation. And we also look at _x000D_
the seriousness of it._x000D_
    And, finally, in any penalty situation, we look at the _x000D_
ability of the violator to pay so that we can be addressing _x000D_
that realistically before we settle on any final penalty."
2926783,2926782,2926784,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
2926784,2926783,2926785,19246,1,    Senator Ernst.
2926785,2926784,2926786,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both _x000D_
for your testimony today._x000D_
    Ms. Shinkman, we do not have to look any further than a lot _x000D_
of headlines out there today to see that the American public _x000D_
does not have a lot of faith nor trust in our government and _x000D_
government officials. That is quite evident with what we see _x000D_
going on in the primaries, the caucuses, and, of course, what _x000D_
we see with a number of agencies across the Federal Government. _x000D_
Could you please tell me the last time that Administrator _x000D_
McCarthy reviewed the procedures of the onsite inspectors."
2926786,2926785,2926787,19246,1,"    I am sorry, I cannot answer that. I will be _x000D_
happy to get back to you and look into that."
2926787,2926786,2926788,19246,1,"    If you would, please."
2926788,2926787,2926789,19246,1,    Sure.
2926789,2926788,2926790,19246,1,"    And, do you know, has she ever participated _x000D_
in an inspection from start to finish to better understand what _x000D_
our small businesses must do to comply with their inspections?"
2926790,2926789,2926791,19246,1,    I will certainly look into that.
2926791,2926790,2926792,19246,1,"    OK. And, my point of this is that there are _x000D_
a lot of bureaucrats out there that will simply throw out rules _x000D_
and regulations without understanding the full impact from _x000D_
start to finish, both the labor intensity in any of these rules _x000D_
and regulations or the cost to the businesses. I think it is _x000D_
disregarded so many times._x000D_
    So, I would like to see leaders leading from the front and _x000D_
understanding what they are instructing our civilian _x000D_
population, our companies, our small businesses, to comply _x000D_
with. It is easy to sit in an office and push out rules and _x000D_
regulations, but we need leaders that are willing to go on the _x000D_
ground and actually walk through these situations with those _x000D_
business owners so they get it. Our American public feels that _x000D_
our bureaucrats do not get it. They have lost touch with what _x000D_
is going on out in the communities._x000D_
    As you know, EPA's Waters Rule is very concerning to many _x000D_
in my State, as well as many others out there, and I want to _x000D_
take a minute to get some clarity on the interim Clean Water _x000D_
Act settlement penalty policy, and I am going to quote here. It _x000D_
says that, ``it sets forth how the agency generally expects to _x000D_
exercise its enforcement discretion in deciding on an _x000D_
appropriate enforcement response and determining an appropriate _x000D_
settlement penalty.''_x000D_
    And then I am going to walk you through the formula on how _x000D_
to calculate a penalty. Again, ``The settlement penalty is _x000D_
calculated based on this formula. Penalty equals economic _x000D_
benefit plus gravity, plus or minus gravity adjustment factors, _x000D_
minus litigation considerations, minus ability to pay, minus _x000D_
supplemental environmental projects.''_x000D_
    My concern that I hope that you can address is that it _x000D_
seems you all have a tremendous amount of discretion when it _x000D_
comes to enforcing a penalty, that is No. 1. And, to be honest, _x000D_
I have never seen a formula with so many variables here. And _x000D_
not only do we have so many variables, it is EPA that decides _x000D_
what the gravity is, what the economic benefit is, what that _x000D_
litigation consideration is, and you also decide what the _x000D_
business's ability to pay is._x000D_
    This is very confusing, and how is this approach assisting _x000D_
business owners into compliance? It seems like we have the EPA _x000D_
against our businesses, and can you explain this policy."
2926792,2926791,2926793,19246,1,"    Thank you, Senator. I will attempt?"
2926793,2926792,2926794,19246,1,    Very frustrating.
2926794,2926793,2926795,19246,1,"    Well, I appreciate that, and those of us who _x000D_
work with it every day perhaps get a little more familiar with _x000D_
it and perhaps lose sight of how it might look to someone for _x000D_
the first time or the second time. So, maybe we need to look at _x000D_
our language a little bit better. But, I can explain a couple _x000D_
of those elements to you----"
2926795,2926794,2926796,19246,1,"    Please._x000D_
helpful._x000D_
    Starting from the back, the ability to pay, the only way _x000D_
EPA determines or makes any finding about ability to pay is _x000D_
based on what the violator submits. If we have a penalty amount _x000D_
that seems to be appropriate, and I will get to how that is _x000D_
derived in a minute, but if the entity says that they do not _x000D_
think they can pay, we ask them to explain that and give us _x000D_
some information about why, and we look into realistically _x000D_
whether that is true, based on tax returns or other economic _x000D_
financial statements that a business might provide._x000D_
    So, the EPA does not pick out from the air what the ability _x000D_
to pay is. We work with the information that is provided by the _x000D_
entity, and we give that opportunity to provide statements _x000D_
about pay, and very often it leads to a reduction in the _x000D_
penalty. So, that is how that determination is made toward the _x000D_
end._x000D_
    The economic benefit is a way of finding out whether a _x000D_
company that, if not in compliance, benefited by not having to, _x000D_
say, pay for controls that all of their competitors had to pay _x000D_
for. If there is some kind of equipment that costs maybe _x000D_
$10,000 a year to operate and the entity that was in _x000D_
noncompliance did not install it but all of their competitors _x000D_
did, they received an economic benefit of $10,000 every year _x000D_
that they operated without that control. So, that would be an _x000D_
economic benefit that would be part of the penalty calculation."
2926796,2926795,2926797,19246,1,"    But, all of this is decided by the EPA, _x000D_
correct?"
2926797,2926796,2926798,19246,1,"    In discussions with the company. We would not _x000D_
have the information without talking to the company. But, we _x000D_
would ask, if we saw that they did not have the control, we _x000D_
would talk perhaps to the competitors, perhaps we would know _x000D_
what that control cost, and if it was not there, it is an _x000D_
iterative process, coming up with a penalty. Those are two _x000D_
elements that are distinct that you mentioned. That is how the _x000D_
ability to pay works. That is how the economic benefit works._x000D_
    And then the other considerations that some, I think, were _x000D_
listed as part of what we call the gravity component, that is _x000D_
where the willfulness as opposed to the unknowingness comes in, _x000D_
and the length of the violation--if it was a spill, whether it _x000D_
went on for a month or a day, what the harm was from it. Those _x000D_
are the kinds of considerations that come in, and sometimes in _x000D_
a matrix way that we work with the company on to try to _x000D_
determine what the appropriate penalty is._x000D_
    And, we resolve most of our cases through settlements by _x000D_
having this discussion. And, rather than just having a free-_x000D_
wheeling, what do you think is appropriate, we set out these _x000D_
guidelines. The economic benefit is one and then the gravity _x000D_
component is built--consists of these other considerations, _x000D_
like damage, length of time, the prior history of the violator."
2926798,2926797,2926799,19246,1,"    OK. And, I know I am going way over. I am _x000D_
going to make one final point, because we have cases like _x000D_
Senator Peters was just discussing with the Flint water _x000D_
situation, where the EPA did know something. We do not know the _x000D_
full extent of this, but the EPA knew. We have a mine spill _x000D_
that affected a river. Who decides if the EPA is at fault and _x000D_
how much they should be fined for incidents like this?_x000D_
    And, I know you cannot answer that. That is just one of _x000D_
those questions out there that, it seems like the EPA has got _x000D_
so much power and control over so many situations. You try and _x000D_
gain more control through expanded definition of Waters of the _x000D_
United States, but you cannot honestly manage what you already _x000D_
have under your belt._x000D_
    So, I am going to stop right there, but I appreciate the _x000D_
extra time. Thank you very much."
2926799,2926798,2926800,19246,1,    Senator Heitkamp.
2926800,2926799,2926801,19246,1,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    As someone who once upon a time, when I was tax _x000D_
commissioner, had to write a penalty policy, I sympathize, _x000D_
because frequently, if you just leave it up to discretion _x000D_
without any kind of policy, what you get is the squeaky wheel _x000D_
gets the grease and everybody else who is in exactly the same _x000D_
situation is not treated fairly, if they say, well, I did it, _x000D_
so I am going to pay the penalty. We need to make sure that _x000D_
that does not happen, and so I would just suggest to you that _x000D_
people can be bitter if they find out, boy, I did not get my _x000D_
penalty waived or reduced, but he did simply because he asked. _x000D_
And, so, I just set that out as one of the concerns._x000D_
    But, my main reason for wanting to have this hearing and _x000D_
for how I look at this is penalties should be last resort. That _x000D_
should be the very end of enforcement. That should be the end _x000D_
of regulation. That should be reserved for those people who do _x000D_
not get it, who have done something that is, in my opinion, _x000D_
fairly blatant, knowing that they have not been in compliance _x000D_
with the regulation._x000D_
    I was intrigued by the stakeholder discussions, because I _x000D_
think compliance is why we have penalties, and you should all _x000D_
want, as agency heads, to walk in and never assess a penalty. _x000D_
It means that you are doing your work on the front end in terms _x000D_
of compliance._x000D_
    And, so, I was interested in the work that OSHA does with _x000D_
stakeholders that you discussed in your testimony. Can you _x000D_
elaborate how you reach out to safety organizations and how you _x000D_
collaborate with manufacturers and stakeholder groups."
2926801,2926800,2926802,19246,1,"    Yes. We have a number of means of doing that. _x000D_
First of all, we have a fairly large part of our budget that _x000D_
goes to compliance assistance. I think it is this year about _x000D_
$68 million."
2926802,2926801,2926803,19246,1,    What percentage is that?
2926803,2926802,2926804,19246,1,"    Well, it is a little over 10 percent, probably _x000D_
12 percent----"
2926804,2926803,2926805,19246,1,    You may want to up that a little bit.
2926805,2926804,2926806,19246,1,"    Well, it has actually been cut back since--that _x000D_
is one of our budget items that has never really recovered from _x000D_
sequestration, which is rather upsetting, because what that _x000D_
money does largely is go to paying for what we call compliance _x000D_
assistance specialists, which we at one time had one in each _x000D_
one of our 85 area offices. Now, we are not able to quite _x000D_
afford that anymore. And, what these compliance assistance _x000D_
specialists do is they work with businesses to make sure that _x000D_
they are aware of their obligations under the law, that they _x000D_
are aware of best practices, that they are aware of basically _x000D_
how to keep their workplaces safe."
2926806,2926805,2926807,19246,1,"    North Dakota has a workforce safety _x000D_
program that is State run, and I think it might be one of the--_x000D_
it used to be everybody had State-run systems and now we have _x000D_
transitioned. Can you talk about how you work with the State-_x000D_
based systems? Could you not expand your outreach in terms of _x000D_
workforce safety by working with the insurance agencies?"
2926807,2926806,2926808,19246,1,"    Yes, and we do try to work with everyone, not _x000D_
only with private sector stakeholders, but with the States. _x000D_
Now, North Dakota is not one of the States that has its own _x000D_
health and safety program, so we are directly responsible for _x000D_
enforcement of health and safety, workplace health and safety."
2926808,2926807,2926809,19246,1,"    And you have two inspectors in North _x000D_
Dakota."
2926809,2926808,2926810,19246,1,    Yes. We are trying to up that.
2926810,2926809,2926811,19246,1,    Yes.
2926811,2926810,2926812,19246,1,"    We know there is a major problem there. We are _x000D_
actually opening an office--and right now, we actually have an _x000D_
office that covers South Dakota and North Dakota. We are _x000D_
opening up a new office in South Dakota so that we can put more _x000D_
resources into North Dakota, because we realize, given the oil _x000D_
boom there, there is a major demand, and, the incidents and _x000D_
injuries and illnesses and fatalities that have come along with _x000D_
that. So, we do try to work very carefully with the States _x000D_
where they have those resources, again, as well as with the _x000D_
private sector in all States."
2926812,2926811,2926813,19246,1,"    When I served on the board of directors _x000D_
of a large chemical--that is what is was--gasification plant, I _x000D_
mean, we had a safety report before we did anything else, and I _x000D_
think the industry is very interested in workforce safety. It _x000D_
is expensive not to be focused on workforce safety. And, a lot _x000D_
of the programs like the ones that are run by the State of _x000D_
North Dakota encourage compliance and, so, I am trying to _x000D_
basically say, let us not get out there with a ``gotcha.'' Let _x000D_
us get out there and invest a lot of resources in meeting kind _x000D_
of compliance on the front end._x000D_
    The other thing that will be a bonus as a result of that is _x000D_
you will begin to understand how some of your regulations are _x000D_
perceived and that they do not add value to safety and the _x000D_
workforce. Those are regulations that have been written in _x000D_
Washington, D.C., that, as Senator Ernst talked about, when _x000D_
they are applied, do not necessarily achieve a result that in _x000D_
any way adds value to workforce safety._x000D_
    And, so, I just really think 10 percent of the compliance _x000D_
budget, or enforcement budget, going to educating and getting _x000D_
people into compliance is an inadequate balance._x000D_
    I am kind of running out of time, but I would like to know _x000D_
what that split is at EPA."
2926813,2926812,2926814,19246,1,"    I do not know offhand what it is. We could _x000D_
certainly get that information for you. We do have compliance _x000D_
programs, particularly for small businesses and for _x000D_
agriculture----"
2926814,2926813,2926815,19246,1,"    Why do you think everybody is so afraid _x000D_
of EPA? No, I mean, I think, you sit here, and I think _x000D_
sometimes EPA feels under siege, but we hear it when we are _x000D_
there. We hear the concerns. We hear the fear. That is not _x000D_
exaggerated and it is not an over-focus of ours. So, what is it _x000D_
about your agency that strikes the fear in the heart of the _x000D_
people you regulate?"
2926815,2926814,2926816,19246,1,"    I do not think I can answer that directly. I _x000D_
appreciate----"
2926816,2926815,2926817,19246,1,"    I am just making my point. You do not _x000D_
need to try and answer that question. But, I think it is a _x000D_
legitimate point and I think it should cause some soul _x000D_
searching within your agency on why that is and how you can do _x000D_
a better job working with those people._x000D_
    You can only look at what happened in Flint and realize how _x000D_
critically important it is, what you do. I mean, and that you _x000D_
do what you do well. Flint is a reminder to all of us that we _x000D_
need these agencies. But the question becomes, how do we _x000D_
prevent this from happening, as Senator Peters talked about, _x000D_
but also, how do we develop a better relationship long-term."
2926817,2926816,2926818,19246,1,"    Senator, if I could correct one thing I said, I _x000D_
mentioned our $68 million for compliance assistance."
2926818,2926817,2926819,19246,1,    Yes.
2926819,2926818,2926820,19246,1,"    That is our Federal compliance assistance budget _x000D_
for the services that I mentioned. We also have what I _x000D_
mentioned in my testimony----"
2926820,2926819,2926821,19246,1,"    Right, the State----_x000D_
which goes totally to small employers, and that is about $50--I _x000D_
think it was $57 million, so that is added to the $68 million _x000D_
that I mentioned before."
2926821,2926820,2926822,19246,1,    I will followup with some questions.
2926822,2926821,2926823,19246,1,    OK.
2926823,2926822,2926824,19246,1,"    And, I am interested in what your plans _x000D_
are for the Dakotas, so----"
2926824,2926823,2926825,19246,1,    Sure.
2926825,2926824,2926826,19246,1,"    Let me just give you a couple quotes. As _x000D_
we asked the question, and we let people know that we had this _x000D_
hearing and were trying to gather information and background _x000D_
sources, and I have several stories and things that I can share _x000D_
on it, let me just pull a couple quotes here, just about the _x000D_
fines and the mindset of when inspectors come._x000D_
    One person told us that they were told that when an _x000D_
inspector came, they said to them, ``if it takes all day, we _x000D_
will stay until we find a violation''._x000D_
    One person said, ``the EPA views businesses as an ATM to be _x000D_
fined, regardless of the determinations of an investigation''._x000D_
    Another one said, ``the determination of whether there is a _x000D_
fine and the amount depended on the mood of the investigator''._x000D_
    Said this one, ``there has been a culture change from one _x000D_
of compliance assistance to one of scaring people into _x000D_
compliance''._x000D_
    And then this one, ``more stick than carrot''. I thought it _x000D_
was interesting._x000D_
    Now, I would tell you, just interacting with the two of you _x000D_
and hearing your mindset and your view on this, I think if most _x000D_
business folks were sitting across the table from you and _x000D_
talking back and forth, they could work a lot of things out. _x000D_
But, there is a real sense, and what Senator Heitkamp had _x000D_
mentioned before, I have heard from numerous employers saying, _x000D_
if I went back--and people that own small businesses--if I went _x000D_
back 10 years ago, when someone showed up for an inspection, _x000D_
they were extremely helpful to me and they were helping me find _x000D_
safety issues. Now, they show up and they are just a fine._x000D_
    And something seems to have shifted, and now it has gone _x000D_
from ``I am grateful to have the help to walk around the _x000D_
facility with fresh eyes,'' to, ``oh no, they are coming. I am _x000D_
going to have to pay a fine for something, no matter what it _x000D_
is''. So, I do not know if you could say what has occurred, but _x000D_
that real life sense is out there, and so this perception that _x000D_
for many is reality, of I do not want an inspector to come help _x000D_
me to find safety violations because I know I am going to have _x000D_
a fine. Even if it costs them all day to stay here, they are _x000D_
going to find something._x000D_
    Some of this goes back to the training you all talked about _x000D_
before. I know EPA had the wonderful experience of several _x000D_
years ago having someone in Region 6 say, ``the way we do this _x000D_
is like the Turks used to do it, to go into town and grab five _x000D_
guys and crucify them. Then there are no problems after that''. _x000D_
Obviously, that is not the EPA's attitude as a whole. And, when _x000D_
you talk about trying to train people in regions and making _x000D_
sure it is consistent, that comes to mind immediately when you _x000D_
think there was a region that was most certainly not consistent _x000D_
with the EPA national value._x000D_
    I am actually going to get to one--my question is, how do _x000D_
you balance out the issue of compliance and the real deterrence _x000D_
that a fine is and being helpful to someone in being able to _x000D_
walk through? We want any business to have a fresh set of eyes _x000D_
to look around for health and safety issues. We do not want _x000D_
them to be able to push us away. How are we currently trying to _x000D_
balance that out to reengage with business, to say, we want to _x000D_
be able to help in the process? And, I will have just both of _x000D_
you mention that."
2926826,2926825,2926827,19246,1,"    Thank you. First, I would like to address the _x000D_
disconnect that you have described. Clearly, that is what it _x000D_
is, I hope. Certainly, from EPA's perspective, we really _x000D_
believe in our mission to reduce pollution and protect the _x000D_
health of the communities that we all serve. That really is the _x000D_
mission. That is how we feel about it. I understand that there _x000D_
is a perception out there as you have well described. And, so, _x000D_
we need to work at getting around that disconnect._x000D_
    I believe there are a couple ways that we have tried. We do _x000D_
have compliance assistance available for small businesses. We _x000D_
have tried to improve on that and making it available._x000D_
    We have also focused on some of our penalty and enforcement _x000D_
methods to look at ways to deal with small entities, with small _x000D_
violations. We have expanded our--we call them Expedited _x000D_
Settlement Agreements (ESA). These are ways that we can, when _x000D_
there is a small violation seen in the field, we can address it _x000D_
rather quickly. We use this for things like underground storage _x000D_
tanks where there might be a leak, some recordkeeping in some _x000D_
of our chemical violations, things that we see that are small, _x000D_
can be remedied quickly. We try to have what is really a non-_x000D_
negotiable agreement. It is small. These are the facts. We can _x000D_
all agree to them quickly. And we have tried to expand our use _x000D_
of those so that when there is a small violation that can be _x000D_
dealt with quickly, we can use that."
2926827,2926826,2926828,19246,1,"    Can you walk me through the settlement _x000D_
process? And this will be one, Mr. Barab, I want to get a _x000D_
chance to visit with you, as well. You both mentioned the _x000D_
settlement. There is a very clear process, and as Senator Ernst _x000D_
had mentioned before, I get it as far as the benefit and the _x000D_
cost and the risk and all those things. I get the process and _x000D_
going into that."
2926828,2926827,2926829,19246,1,    Sure.
2926829,2926828,2926830,19246,1,"    The challenge is, once you go through _x000D_
that, you set a fine and then there is a process to have a _x000D_
conversation on the settlement. Here is the fine. Now, let us _x000D_
talk about if we are going to settle on it. How does that part _x000D_
of the process work? What is the mechanics of that?"
2926830,2926829,2926831,19246,1,"    OK. Let me start maybe a little earlier. It _x000D_
really is an incremental process. An inspector goes out and _x000D_
sees that there is a problem."
2926831,2926830,2926832,19246,1,    Right.
2926832,2926831,2926833,19246,1,"    Unless it is an emergency that needs to be _x000D_
addressed immediately, there is usually a discussion about it _x000D_
and then they come back to the office and discuss what, if _x000D_
anything, needs to be done about it from an enforcement _x000D_
perspective._x000D_
    After that determination is--if there is a violation that _x000D_
actually merits taking enforcement action, then there is a _x000D_
discussion about what level of enforcement to take. Is this _x000D_
something that can be dealt with administratively by going back _x000D_
and talking about it and seeing whether it is a small, quick _x000D_
resolution or whether it is something that is going to require _x000D_
changes at the facility that would require some investment and _x000D_
some monitoring. An awful lot of them do not, but if they do, _x000D_
there is a further discussion about that."
2926833,2926832,2926834,19246,1,"    Can I ask you a quick question on that? _x000D_
When you find a violation, does that warrant a fine every time?"
2926834,2926833,2926835,19246,1,    It depends----
2926835,2926834,2926836,19246,1,"    As far as, do you feel an obligation _x000D_
coming at you either legislatively or from a guidance that if _x000D_
there is a violation, that is a fine?"
2926836,2926835,2926837,19246,1,    We have enforcement discretion and we can----
2926837,2926836,2926838,19246,1,"    OK. Mr. Barab, do you all have _x000D_
enforcement discretion, as well? Do you feel that----"
2926838,2926837,2926839,19246,1,"    I would say, generally, we are required to issue _x000D_
a fine of some sort when we find a violation."
2926839,2926838,2926840,19246,1,    Every time.
2926840,2926839,2926841,19246,1,"    There is some discretion there, but, yes, that _x000D_
is the----"
2926841,2926840,2926842,19246,1,"    OK. I want to talk about that. I hate to _x000D_
interrupt you, but I wanted to get some clarity on that to make _x000D_
sure we are heading in the same direction. Go ahead and you can _x000D_
finish, Ms. Shinkman."
2926842,2926841,2926843,19246,1,"    So, there is enforcement discretion. We _x000D_
decide whether it is something that within our policies merits _x000D_
further action. That further action may be an administrative _x000D_
order or an agreement that we talk about, we reach agreement _x000D_
that the first thing we want to do is abate whatever the _x000D_
problem is."
2926843,2926842,2926844,19246,1,    Right.
2926844,2926843,2926845,19246,1,"    And, so, that is what is addressed first, _x000D_
whether it is going to require additional action, stopping _x000D_
something, starting something, try to resolve it that way. If _x000D_
we reach that resolution, in most cases, there will be at least _x000D_
some penalty because there was noncompliance, and then we go _x000D_
through the factors to decide how large the penalty is._x000D_
    In a bigger case, what would happen, generally, is there _x000D_
would be further discussions and there may even be a referral _x000D_
to the Department of Justice, and then there are further _x000D_
discussions within EPA, with the Department of Justice, and _x000D_
with the entity that is out of compliance. So, it is an _x000D_
incremental process, an iterative._x000D_
    I think a lot of the things that you are hearing about tend _x000D_
to be the small ones. But, the reality is, there is usually a _x000D_
process and there is a lot of dialogue back and forth before _x000D_
there is an ultimate resolution about what injunctive relief or _x000D_
change needs to be made in the processes to make sure that the _x000D_
company is in compliance going forward, what mitigation needs _x000D_
to be done for any damage that might have--like a spill or _x000D_
something like that that needs to be cleaned up, and then, what _x000D_
penalty do we need under the standards that we have."
2926845,2926844,2926846,19246,1,"    We are still back to the settlement _x000D_
thing. The process, how to get there. Once the fine has been--_x000D_
the settlement that you are describing, is that typically a _x000D_
judicial settlement? We are in a court and we are trying to _x000D_
work through that? Or----"
2926846,2926845,2926847,19246,1,"    It could be both._x000D_
settlement?"
2926847,2926846,2926848,19246,1,"    The other is administrative, in which case we _x000D_
would have either an order that is appealable or a signed _x000D_
agreement, and that goes through our administrative process to _x000D_
the Environmental Appeals Board."
2926848,2926847,2926849,19246,1,"    And that is a more fluid conversation _x000D_
that is happening----"
2926849,2926848,2926850,19246,1,"    Yes, it is._x000D_
on the facts, now, what is a reasonable fine, and you are _x000D_
discussing that process."
2926850,2926849,2926851,19246,1,"    We certainly try to reach agreement on all of _x000D_
those. Obviously, we do not always."
2926851,2926850,2926852,19246,1,"    Mr. Barab, is the settlement process _x000D_
pretty similar for you all? Again, I understand once you get to _x000D_
the spot of a fine, an assignment, you had mentioned very well _x000D_
about the exact numbers and the changes that have happened in _x000D_
the Budget Act and such from there. But, I am talking about the _x000D_
settlement process at the end."
2926852,2926851,2926853,19246,1,"    Yes. Our process is slightly different than _x000D_
EPA's. Once we finish the inspection, the inspector then goes _x000D_
back to the office. The area director actually has authority _x000D_
over what the penalty will be, assuming any kind of violations _x000D_
have been found._x000D_
    At that point, the employer has 15 days to contest the _x000D_
citation, if the employer wants to do that. During that 15-day _x000D_
period, there is a chance, and we strongly encourage employers _x000D_
to engage in what we call our informal settlement process. So, _x000D_
the employer comes into the office, the area office, and sits _x000D_
down with our area director and they try to work out some kind _x000D_
of settlement, if possible. And, again, looking at the _x000D_
violations there were, looking at the employer's defenses, _x000D_
looking at the abatement period. All of those things are _x000D_
discussed during that informal period. And, again, in about _x000D_
two-thirds of the cases that we have, we do reach some kind of _x000D_
settlement at that point with the employer._x000D_
    Now, if no settlement is reached, then within that 15-day _x000D_
period, the employer can contest, legally contest, the _x000D_
citation. That then goes to the Occupational Safety and Health _x000D_
Review Commission. There are Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) _x000D_
that decide that, and that case then moves up that ladder."
2926853,2926852,2926854,19246,1,"    OK. Let me ask the question about the _x000D_
flexibility that you have or do not have on fines. Is it a _x000D_
guidance or is it statutory that if you see a violation, there _x000D_
has to be a fine?"
2926854,2926853,2926855,19246,1,"    That is statutory, and our maximum penalties are _x000D_
set also by law."
2926855,2926854,2926856,19246,1,    OK----
2926856,2926855,2926857,19246,1,"    But we are also----_x000D_
penalty, that is statutory that it requires----"
2926857,2926856,2926858,19246,1,"    The only place there is a minimum penalty is _x000D_
with willful violations, and that is a $5,000 minimum, $70,000 _x000D_
maximum. As I mentioned, there are also--by statute, we also _x000D_
have to consider, as EPA does, size, history, and good faith. _x000D_
So, there are almost always reductions there."
2926858,2926857,2926859,19246,1,"    So, at the end of this, as you all both _x000D_
mentioned that the goal of the penalty is always deterrence, _x000D_
and I get that. But, the goal of the regulation and of the _x000D_
statute is usually health and safety and environmental _x000D_
protection and such, and the fine, the penalty here, becomes a _x000D_
vehicle to help accomplish some of that. But, I do not know of _x000D_
anyone that has written a statute to make sure that we fine _x000D_
some entity, as well. That is the worst case scenario for us._x000D_
    I give you the easy example we have all experienced. My _x000D_
daughter when she was in high school was pulled over by a _x000D_
police officer because her dad, me, was not helping her watch _x000D_
for things like a headlight that was out. Now, she is also a _x000D_
teenager and she can watch for that herself, but as the dad and _x000D_
the 16-year-old gets pulled over with a headlight out, she was _x000D_
given a warning by the police officer and said, ``hey, did you _x000D_
know? '' She said, ``I did not know, did not catch it.'' He _x000D_
gave her a warning._x000D_
    We got back home and spent $125 rearranging the front of _x000D_
her car to do a new headlight. Joy, OK. She got a warning. We _x000D_
fixed it. The health and safety issue of getting both _x000D_
headlights working was accomplished._x000D_
    What I am trying to figure out is, how much flexibility do _x000D_
your compliance folks have to be able to walk in and say, you _x000D_
know what? That trash can is in the wrong spot, and someone to _x000D_
say, I did not realize. When I walk through manufacturing _x000D_
locations, as you all do all the time, as well, on the wall _x000D_
somewhere, there is a library of four-inch plastic binders that _x000D_
are sitting up there with all the regs and all the requirements _x000D_
and most of the people that run the manufacturing locations _x000D_
live in dread that they have missed a page somewhere from those _x000D_
six four-inch binders that are up there on the wall somewhere _x000D_
trying to make sure that they miss it._x000D_
    How much flexibility do you feel like you have to be able _x000D_
to help people, to say, you missed one, and it is not _x000D_
necessarily a fine, and it is not necessarily, a leak that is _x000D_
going to damage a lot of folks or was not necessarily health _x000D_
and safety, but they missed one."
2926859,2926858,2926860,19246,1,"    There are certainly small things that we correct _x000D_
as we walk around, or ask the employers to correct. There is no _x000D_
doubt about that. But, again, our concern is saving lives, _x000D_
and----"
2926860,2926859,2926861,19246,1,"    Sure._x000D_
only the maximum of $7,000, there is a requirement the way a _x000D_
serious violation is defined in that it has to be likely to _x000D_
cause death or serious physical harm. So, those are, again, _x000D_
fairly serious, as the term is, when we find those, and----"
2926861,2926860,2926862,19246,1,"    I have no issue with that. I am talking _x000D_
about minor fines."
2926862,2926861,2926863,19246,1,    Yes.
2926863,2926862,2926864,19246,1,"    One of my manufacturers was fined because _x000D_
he had a shelf in his workspace for one of his workers that was _x000D_
six inches too low. Now, I do not know all the story on that, _x000D_
but I stood on the floor with him and I said, ``that shelf _x000D_
right there? '' And he said, ``Yes, that shelf right there, we _x000D_
had to raise by six inches and we got a fine for it.''"
2926864,2926863,2926865,19246,1,"    Yes. I mean, we hear stories like that, and _x000D_
generally, when we look into them, usually, there is something _x000D_
else accompanying that with it that is of a more serious _x000D_
nature. But, when we have situations like that, we are always _x000D_
happy to look into them, but it sounds unlikely that there _x000D_
would be any kind of fines----"
2926865,2926864,2926866,19246,1,"    But, I think what we are asking is, let _x000D_
us say you see an extension cord that is located in a location _x000D_
where somebody could trip. That is obviously a hazard. You note _x000D_
it. Are you telling me, because that is a violation, you have _x000D_
to assess a fine?"
2926866,2926865,2926867,19246,1,"    We also have various means. We have other than _x000D_
serious fines, where they can be very low. We have a quick fix, _x000D_
where we can--if the employer fixes it right away, we can _x000D_
either minimize or, in some cases, eliminate the fine, so----"
2926867,2926866,2926868,19246,1,"    Yes, right there. Stop."
2926868,2926867,2926869,19246,1,"    You said, ``eliminate the fine.'' So, you _x000D_
do have discretion to not impose any fine----"
2926869,2926868,2926870,19246,1,    In exceptional cases----
2926870,2926869,2926871,19246,1,"    In general, our law requires us to issue a fine _x000D_
when we find a violation, especially if it is a serious _x000D_
violation. But there are other than serious violations. Now, an _x000D_
extension cord, I mean, that is something that it can cause _x000D_
fires, electrocutions----"
2926871,2926870,2926872,19246,1,"    No, I know."
2926872,2926871,2926873,19246,1,"    It is not necessarily--I mean, people throw some _x000D_
things out, but they actually, when you look at them, when we _x000D_
look at the past history----"
2926873,2926872,2926874,19246,1,"    No, I thought it was a good example, _x000D_
because it can be, in the wrong place, incredibly dangerous. _x000D_
But, my point is, I would have to go back and take a look, _x000D_
because I am shocked that you could not waive a fine or a _x000D_
penalty in its entirety given kind of the relationship and _x000D_
compliance and what do they know and lack of knowledge and _x000D_
severity._x000D_
    So, we will followup. I have to go vote."
2926874,2926873,2926875,19246,1,"    Thank you. We will finish up in just a _x000D_
couple of minutes, because I am going to have to go follow and _x000D_
vote, as well._x000D_
    This is one of the areas that we want to examine. It is the _x000D_
reason we have this type of hearing and debate. We will dig _x000D_
into it and find out from you all what you need, because I _x000D_
would hope that you are in the same position that we are _x000D_
working on health and safety and making sure we are protecting _x000D_
lives and this is not all about fines. As you mentioned before, _x000D_
the fines are not coming back to the entity themselves, anyway, _x000D_
so this is not a, quote-unquote, ``money maker'' for the _x000D_
agency. It is a deterrent, but we have to find a way to be able _x000D_
to balance this out._x000D_
    One of the things that I had noticed was in 2011, the _x000D_
President issued a memorandum for the heads of the executive _x000D_
departments on regulatory compliance. OSHA and EPA were _x000D_
specifically noted in that for being good actors in it and _x000D_
highlighted some of the compliance and enforcement information _x000D_
and how you are making that publicly available. So, that is a _x000D_
positive thing to say. Your agencies both are building in _x000D_
transparency on the basic issue of compliance and enforcement _x000D_
information._x000D_
    Not every agency is dealing with this. I am not going to _x000D_
ask you to answer for everyone else. But, the Department of _x000D_
Transportation (DOT) updated their stuff in 2011, and then _x000D_
since 2012, there has been no change at all on their website on _x000D_
the information on compliance and enforcement information._x000D_
    So, one of the things that we are asking of the _x000D_
administration is to help us, when the information gets out _x000D_
there and is helpful, to make sure all agencies are actually _x000D_
fulfilling that, are getting that information out, which both _x000D_
of your agencies are, but the Department of Transportation is _x000D_
not. So, that kind of consistency is extremely important._x000D_
    We do need to work with your entities on things like minor _x000D_
violations. Was a poster missing? Was a piece of paperwork _x000D_
missing? Again, I had another agency and another entity that I _x000D_
dealt with as a manufacturer in my State that had not turned in _x000D_
paperwork a particular year saying they had nothing to turn in, _x000D_
and their wrong assumption was, I had nothing to report and so _x000D_
I did not have to turn in that report this year because there _x000D_
was nothing to report. They ended up having a huge fine come _x000D_
down on them for not turning in paperwork saying they had _x000D_
nothing to turn in._x000D_
    Well, again, that just begs this question of how is that _x000D_
helping health and safety? That is a paperwork violation issue. _x000D_
There should be a, hey, you did not turn that in. You are _x000D_
right, we did not turn it in. But, instead, they had a fairly _x000D_
significant fine that came down on them for that. That is the _x000D_
kind of stuff that we need to figure out, to say, if you feel _x000D_
bound, or if agencies feel bound to be able to do a fine in _x000D_
that type of situation, then we have a problem._x000D_
    One of our businesses said that they were hesitant to _x000D_
voluntarily invite OSHA into the workplace to do the onsite _x000D_
consultation programs because of their concern over that. Now, _x000D_
I heard from both of you, you want to work especially with _x000D_
small businesses to do the onsite consultation, to be able to _x000D_
help them through that. What is something that can be done to _x000D_
encourage more businesses to say, invite us to come in. We are _x000D_
not coming in to fine you. We are coming in to be able to help, _x000D_
to do almost a pre-inspection inspection."
2926875,2926874,2926876,19246,1,"    Yes. I often call our consultation program our _x000D_
best kept secret. It is a wonderful program. We try everything _x000D_
we can to really promote it, not only ourselves, but through _x000D_
associations. And, I want to emphasize, and we try to emphasize _x000D_
this with employers, we fund at least 90 percent of the _x000D_
consultation program. We do not run it, though. We give that _x000D_
money to the States and they run it. So, it is totally separate _x000D_
from OSHA, and that is what we try to emphasize to employers, _x000D_
that this is totally separate from OSHA. It is a free visit, _x000D_
basically, that small employers can receive and everybody _x000D_
should be taking advantage of it."
2926876,2926875,2926877,19246,1,"    But, some are concerned that they should _x000D_
not because they are, for whatever reason--what I am telling _x000D_
you is, it is a good program----"
2926877,2926876,2926878,19246,1,"    Yes._x000D_
and safety and on compliance on issues and thinking outside the _x000D_
box and some things. There has to be a way to be able to _x000D_
communicate this so that individuals know, hey, this is a _x000D_
neutral spot. Unless there is some major gross something that _x000D_
is here, this is a good spot."
2926878,2926877,2926879,19246,1,"    Well, we would love to work with you on ways to _x000D_
do that."
2926879,2926878,2926880,19246,1,    OK.
2926880,2926879,2926881,19246,1,"    There are a lot of myths out there that we would _x000D_
love to be able to combat and we would love to work with you to _x000D_
do that."
2926881,2926880,2926882,19246,1,"    Well, this is something, I am saying, _x000D_
perception and reality. This is a business owner that said it _x000D_
to me directly. Yes, I know there is that type of a _x000D_
consultation. There is no way I would take that. Ms. Shinkman."
2926882,2926881,2926883,19246,1,"    And, I would just briefly like to say, _x000D_
particularly for small businesses, we have an audit policy _x000D_
where, if they voluntarily disclose and fix what it is, there _x000D_
is minimal, if any, penalty at all. So, we encourage it. The _x000D_
sooner it is disclosed, the more voluntary audit of themselves _x000D_
to determine what the problems are----"
2926883,2926882,2926884,19246,1,    Is that the eDisclosure program?
2926884,2926883,2926885,19246,1,"    Yes, it is."
2926885,2926884,2926886,19246,1,"    OK. Tell me a little bit about how that _x000D_
works, and what I would like to know is, how do you evaluate _x000D_
its effectiveness on how it is actually accomplishing the _x000D_
mission? How do you evaluate that?"
2926886,2926885,2926887,19246,1,"    Well, it is about 2 months old, so I am not _x000D_
too sure----"
2926887,2926886,2926888,19246,1,"    OK. It is a little early, then, yet."
2926888,2926887,2926889,19246,1,"    I do not think we can give you any kind of an _x000D_
evaluation. But, it was formed so that we could quickly see _x000D_
these audit disclosures for a number of cases, particularly _x000D_
smaller ones like you have described, and for small businesses _x000D_
where they, through a web portal, give us notice of what they _x000D_
have disclosed--what they are disclosing----"
2926889,2926888,2926890,19246,1,"    So, give me an example of some of this, _x000D_
because this is their own safety systems, right, their own _x000D_
safety checks that they are doing. They find something, know it _x000D_
is a violation. Give me an example of something they would turn _x000D_
in and say, hey, we found something. We are going to report it."
2926890,2926889,2926891,19246,1,"    We have determined that we do not have the _x000D_
number of containers that we are supposed to for a certain _x000D_
thing, or they have not been updated at a certain time. So, we _x000D_
are going to do that. We discovered it at X date. We did _x000D_
whatever it is to remedy it. It will be done by Y date. And, we _x000D_
are disclosing it to you now and we have a policy for making _x000D_
sure that it is not going to happen again. And, this is all _x000D_
disclosed electronically, and if all of the criteria are met, _x000D_
they will receive a notice that it has been disclosed and their _x000D_
issue would be closed out."
2926891,2926890,2926892,19246,1,"    And, including the benefit? Penalty, as _x000D_
you mentioned before, part of the penalty is did they receive _x000D_
some sort of benefit by delaying that. Would that be waived, as _x000D_
well, or would that be something you guys would look at and go, _x000D_
hey, you did not change this. You got an arbitrary benefit that _x000D_
other companies did not get."
2926892,2926891,2926893,19246,1,"    I think that would not apply here, because _x000D_
part of the criteria is the early disclosure."
2926893,2926892,2926894,19246,1,    OK.
2926894,2926893,2926895,19246,1,"    So, the criteria themselves eliminate those _x000D_
problems."
2926895,2926894,2926896,19246,1,"    OK. That will be one that we want to _x000D_
watch, to be able to see how that works, because that gives a _x000D_
clear set of guidelines out there that people can find and note _x000D_
and to be able to help self-manage. I just want you to know _x000D_
from our Committee, we are going to watch and figure out how _x000D_
that is being evaluated to see if that is something that can be _x000D_
shared with other agencies and entities._x000D_
    I would also share, as well, and this is just in our _x000D_
ongoing conversation about fees and fines and penalties, we are _x000D_
watching some entities like Fish and Wildlife Service. Fish and _x000D_
Wildlife Service has the opportunity for a penalty or to be _x000D_
able to make a contribution to a third-party organization that _x000D_
is a nonprofit. We are trying to figure out who sets that, who _x000D_
guides that, where does that money go. That is money that would _x000D_
have been to the General Treasury now that is to certain _x000D_
outside third-party entities for mitigation or whatever _x000D_
purposes, and, so, we are asking, I think, a fair question for _x000D_
the taxpayers' behalf._x000D_
    If it is a fine that goes to the General Treasury or that _x000D_
you donate to a third-party organization, we want to know who _x000D_
picks that and where does that go and what is the long-term _x000D_
benefit of that._x000D_
    EPA uses Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), but my _x000D_
understanding is that is you can have a penalty or you can _x000D_
basically fix it and here is what we would encourage you to do _x000D_
in some ways. How are those SEPs decided?"
2926896,2926895,2926897,19246,1,"    Those SEPs are voluntary by the company if _x000D_
they--to set off part of the penalty by doing a project. Let me _x000D_
make it clear that they are never cash donations."
2926897,2926896,2926898,19246,1,    Right.
2926898,2926897,2926899,19246,1,"    They are always voluntary projects to help _x000D_
the environment. There needs to be a nexus between what that _x000D_
project is and what the violation was. There will also always _x000D_
be some cash penalty. It is not 100 percent mitigation against _x000D_
the penalty and----"
2926899,2926898,2926900,19246,1,"    Is it typically 80 percent? Because the _x000D_
goal, again, is to deal with health and safety and environment _x000D_
at that point. So, you are saying it could be a control project _x000D_
or monitoring project or something else around them or around _x000D_
the city or around the community----"
2926900,2926899,2926901,19246,1,    It could be----
2926901,2926900,2926902,19246,1,    What does it typically look like?
2926902,2926901,2926903,19246,1,"    Typically, it looks like something like a _x000D_
decision to do monitoring for children for asthma or for lead _x000D_
in a certain school district for a certain period of time. The _x000D_
asthma might be the result of a clean air violation. The lead, _x000D_
for a different kind of--the lead monitoring, those sorts of _x000D_
things, purchase of emergency equipment if there has been a _x000D_
violation that is similar to that._x000D_
    So, here is a policy. We have redone our entire policy so _x000D_
that it is much clearer. We did that last year, so the _x000D_
standards that are necessary to meet--we have strict standards _x000D_
and they are more clearly set out. A small business can get up _x000D_
to 100 percent set off of their penalty. Others, usually, it is _x000D_
around 80 percent. It really depends on the quality and the _x000D_
type of the project. But, it is never money that is just handed _x000D_
to somebody. It is never a project that EPA itself controls."
2926903,2926902,2926904,19246,1,"    Right. EPA is different than other _x000D_
entities on that. There are other entities that are doing _x000D_
mitigation separately to an outside third party rather than a _x000D_
fee or fine, and that is one of the questions we will ask. _x000D_
Obviously, I am not going to ask you to answer for another _x000D_
entity on that._x000D_
    We are quickly running out of time, and I know you are _x000D_
thoroughly enjoying this conversation, but we do have votes _x000D_
that are happening currently. I have to head over to that. I am _x000D_
not going to hold you over to be able to come back and forth._x000D_
    I do want to maintain this conversation. What we would ask _x000D_
of you is I am sure that there are ideas that you or your _x000D_
entities would be interested to be able to share ways they can _x000D_
improve this process, whether that be process changes, issues _x000D_
in statute that had become a problem or that create a barrier _x000D_
between the people we serve and those of us who serve them, as _x000D_
you do, as well. That should be fixed and could be fixed. I _x000D_
want you to know, those are the type of things we are also _x000D_
looking for, as well. This is not a one-way conversation._x000D_
    And for this Committee, we hope to be able to put products _x000D_
out in the days ahead to say, let us help fix some of the _x000D_
broken relationships that we have there and still be able to _x000D_
work on health and safety and environmental protection that _x000D_
need to be done. So, as you have thoughts on that, we are free _x000D_
to hear those and we are interested in those, as well._x000D_
    I appreciate you being here and for the work that you put _x000D_
into this conversation and we will do some followup with some _x000D_
questions for the record in the days ahead on that._x000D_
    I would like to make a statement to all that on February _x000D_
24, this Subcommittee will also hold a hearing examining the _x000D_
burden of Federal statutes and regulations placed on State and _x000D_
local governments, what we have learned since the passage of _x000D_
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, and how the Unfunded _x000D_
Mandates Information and Transparency Act can improve upon _x000D_
those efforts._x000D_
    This will conclude today's hearing. The hearing record will _x000D_
remain open for 15 days, until the close of business on _x000D_
February 26, for the submission of statements or questions for _x000D_
the record._x000D_
    With that, thank you very much to our witnesses. This _x000D_
hearing is adjourned."
